[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast with extra special guest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rue's goofy growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show,
Rue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate everything you've done for me
this weekend, Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thank you for all the stuff you've
done for James Loud genetics over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, six, eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been sharing a lot of content
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we met was Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's like I said, I really
honestly, I didn't know about you until I
[SPEAKER_02]: started growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some dude turned me on your genetics
and I just had great success with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved them right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other things, other ones I've
tried that are finicky and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first ones I got from you,
somebody gifted to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was those frosted biscottis and
they thought they were photo periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew them like I do with my photo
period in a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were about this tall or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw that a couple of them started
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, these are not photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude that gave them to me was
mistaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I transplant them in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when the only auto flowers I
have ever had success transplanting ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them didn't really make it or one
of them didn't make it when I kept in the
[SPEAKER_02]: solo cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are the only auto flowers I've
ever got to transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other flower I've tried transplanting
has always died.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay small or just die.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just I've had the struggle to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've I've learned how to do it
with you can transplant it as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them early enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they if the roots catch it all,
you're that it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never get big.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be an auto file frosted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be the auto flower whisperer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do all my flowers in my hydro buckets
and they just they thrive in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that frosted biscotti special,
we didn't even start selling until just
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to thoroughly test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sent some amazing photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a couple other guys that grew
it, sent some really cool photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just comes out really frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think most people don't think of
it as an auto flower when it's finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know in all my videos,
I've always said when I said frosted
[SPEAKER_02]: biscotti, I said that is the perfect name
for it because you won't believe how many
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes pack on this thing, you know,
for an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've grown all everything I've grown
for you from you is auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody I give it to is does not
believe that they're auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think that I'm lying to him or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm having great success with your auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that because it's helping me
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love auto flowers just as much as I love
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't discriminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they've gotten so much
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at my stuff, but even
some of the other guys out there that are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing really amazing stuff,
it's like you didn't see anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, that's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been growing for 10 years,
but yeah, I've tried out all the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of see what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, saying there's still some of
those janky flowers out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: My stuff has like bad turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, when I was kind of, I was totally
in a switch from auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I mean, I did, I did photo periods,
but once I got my hands on yours,
[SPEAKER_02]: it kept all the flowers in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I loved growing them in my
little veg room, having, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: veg and stuff and flower and stuff at the
same time, seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that's just a happy place,
heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just seeing all stages right then and
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which other ones have you grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've grown the cherry cola OG and the
cherry cola gelato, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Gorilla Zs, OG Kush Cross,
and then the Frosted Biscayne.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Fast Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast Buds made all the receivers on that
line, like the cherry cola, the punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's one more that grew,
but I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, all of them successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I can't believe when the
dude, you know, told me their photo
[SPEAKER_02]: periods and had those auto flowers in the
cup and they were doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they didn't get huge,
but I mean, they were still like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that main cola was still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had still a good four branches
coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't ever really weigh my stuff right
off, you know, harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was one of the most successful
harvests I've had from an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I definitely shocked it a
little bit from transplanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I did, but it still was
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used to transplant with one liters
into three liters from the Char-Core,
[SPEAKER_00]: their cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always had success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and so you can do it if you
do it right, transplanting, but like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go and you have them any longer than
seven days, usually in a cube,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when they get root bound and then
you have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also, auto flowers can be
finicky if you don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing or if you have cold nighttime temps,
you know, the beautiful thing with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers is they can finish in as early as
like 60 to 65 days from germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so- I've had one of years,
and now that I can remember, it was 57
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have pushed it longer if I wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a personal preference,
but it was still dense buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't ask what's up with the,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, you got that good push still when
you put it in the grinder, you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 57 days I remember now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less than two months from seed,
you can have finished flower product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, finished flower, you still got to
dry it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, yeah, that's from, you know,
seed to the whole chopper root.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many years you've been growing now?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little over, probably about four or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had started growing just because I
don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to drink and do a lot of hard
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of broke away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I still had to get flower from
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to mainly get it from my brother,
but there's a couple other buddies and I
[SPEAKER_02]: went to get it from them and they had,
you know, extracurricular activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call them on the table here and
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just saw it and I kind of just
didn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't better in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was wanting, or it was,
but it wasn't what I was still looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to break away from that scene
altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just, yeah, I got a knot in my
stomach and I was just thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: why not just start growing my own?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little cheapo light, you know,
off Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a little corner in my closet and just
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's, I mean, if you want to
grow your own weed, anybody can,
[SPEAKER_02]: believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a lot simpler than you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of learning that goes along
with it, but you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Off the bat, you'll find out if it's for
you or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as simple or as complex as you want
to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it simple and have success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it to an advanced level that
most people couldn't handle and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have failure or you can do it slowly and
be super successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's different levels for
everybody and scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you get better, you can go up in scale,
but like it's great starting out with one
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, I got a lot of respect for
you and what you've done and your
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasm for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were just, you love the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell it's contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, you're like smoke weed,
baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want everybody to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you enjoy weed, you need to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to, uh, for me, it betters my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it makes me deal with things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm off all pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really like taking any type of
pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I maybe take ibuprofen if, you know,
the cannabis can't handle, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my, my knees and my back screaming at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, so yeah, for the most part it's,
it's helped me in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I need to give it the respect that
it deserves.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's a beautiful plant because
as much as you give it, it'll give you
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the more love you put into it,
the more love you get back, the better
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke you get or however you consume it or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that we're huffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lady said, you're huffing and I'm
puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were, yeah, that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reagan and the river is like, we had a
lady and she had some old school hash that
[SPEAKER_00]: was, it was good hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old school hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking it with the, the little
dipper and I tried to get her to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: hit of some rosin from flora and flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Donnie burger that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, no, that's huffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm puffing and y'all are huffing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a little offended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn me into a drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everything has its place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get her on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try her samples.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like that, that have their own
thoughts and stick to their gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think that there's something
to be said for staying in your lane and
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting better and better and better
at that one thing that you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a trademark saying is smoke weed,
baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ronnie Coleman, he's a famous
bodybuilder from Texas also.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says lift weights, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you heard that from him,
but he's from the Arlington area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so before, or lightweight baby is his
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says lightweight baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you said it for the first
time, it reminded me of Ronnie Coleman and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's so passionate about lifting weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he was, you know, Mr. Olympia,
I don't know, 10 times or eight times or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he amazing bodybuilder, just a really
nice guy, but like it's, it's that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the kind of stuff that, that kind of
drives people forward with the passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when people are super passionate
about the plant because I also love
[SPEAKER_00]: everything about the plant and there's so
many benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more people we have on board that
understand that the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's contagious to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you love something so much,
people become curious about why you love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is up with this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: They either think you're crazy or they're
curious about why you think that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the plant too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for me, it's the whole aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even just the smoking of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole getting to know this plant,
learning it, just, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's helped me mentally so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going in my garden, be able to sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I open, like when I do mine,
I'm not a huge, huge on controlling the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I control my temperature mainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an AC in there, but when my stuff
opens, I open the doors, I open the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If lights are on, I'm in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I play music for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm asking how, you know, y'all are doing
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage them, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that whole thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if I, you know, didn't do all
that, maybe it would turn out a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: better, but that's for me right now,
that helps me so much mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm getting good products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm happy with it and anybody I
share it with is happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to keep rocking and
rolling and do what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're the customer that I love
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the type of customer that loves the
finished product, loves everything about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I love supporting the home
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, we have commercial growers
too that are buying this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like the lifeblood of this
industry that we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was built on home growers, on home
growers and people that are passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, where it's not about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even if you didn't get paid a penny
for your stuff, you would still do it
[SPEAKER_00]: because you love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, this, I didn't,
you know, even if you lost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you're one of those guys,
even if you're losing money, you would
[SPEAKER_00]: still do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, I know I mentioned a couple of
times, if I get my outside grow going,
[SPEAKER_02]: I might just be off the grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's that, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that I know I need now, you know
what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that, uh, growing with that plant
and, um, it just helps me so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by next year, we'll probably see you
living up in Humboldt, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reagan on the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't even have to go more than 10
miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm going to be just walking down
that mountain right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just swimming across the river and
there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna be me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, man, yeah, the, the environment
up there is just, you can tell is,
[SPEAKER_02]: we grow in environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it gets nice and warm during the day
and cool at night, but not too cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the note is it's still warm at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like those plants will really thrive
and stretch too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think, you know, the, the heat,
there's a little heat there, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: overly hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some places just get insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not from Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, like our, when we do get extremely
hot, I mean, we could be at 90 by 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it keeps cranking, we can go 105 or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, yeah, those, you know,
really hits you hard, but this one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we got nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't check the temperature,
but I guarantee is nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a couple of days there, but you know,
it hits you later on the evening,
[SPEAKER_02]: not too hard, not too, too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's definitely get up a
sweater at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying too?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to you people just growing outside
there would, you know, have great results,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I, which we all know they do is
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emerald triangle was built on the
emerald triangle triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in humble and I feel like,
yeah, they have great conditions for
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the people up there, you know,
I feel like there's just an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: community up there and you know,
the more I can support them, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody up there is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody up there is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just contagious when you're around
like-minded people that are, that feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way, you know, and it's these people
were outlaws back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, when we're moving forward,
unfortunately, some of them are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: left behind, but like, I feel like there's
going to be time where we can lift them
[SPEAKER_00]: back up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's like in passionate people,
it's like, it's not even about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, it's about the
plant and what it does for us and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes us feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you, the sobriety side of it where
you're, you're basically sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using cannabis as a way to stay
sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I experienced it this weekend with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I unfortunately tried to make it this
weekend without drinking and I drank a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it's like, and I just try to
do the best I can do and I don't give
[SPEAKER_00]: myself shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, and I did smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, you know, and then he got back and
we tried to, you know, we tried all the
[SPEAKER_00]: samples from the cannabis and put them in
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to go back to this room
probably five more times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to sort them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin entries were pretty special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the, there's a couple that were really
good, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, that was fun putting,
you know, testing them, putting them in
[SPEAKER_02]: the order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, I mean, this whole weekend
has been a mind blowing experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that right now, just from,
you know, meeting the, the one and only
[SPEAKER_02]: James loud hanging out with him to,
like I said, I, I wasn't not crazy enough
[SPEAKER_02]: was I camping with James loud,
our neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waking up drinking coffee and sitting
there burning one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he comes rolling out his tent at,
you know, telling me good morning and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we actually helped him move a
little bit of his stuff and he was right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like such an amazing thing
that, yeah, he's such a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's just, he's a regular dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you are saying like, you know,
we all know that, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_02]: people, but it's like, once you,
you see them and you meet them and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, that's the thing is people are
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be asshole people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be amazing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be somewhere in between all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be amazing asshole people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have different varieties of asshole
is some in our, in us, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's take a little rewind back to how
you found out about reggae on the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, well I found out about it cause,
uh, we're doing one of our monthly phone
[SPEAKER_02]: calls or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we're trying to do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you were like, oh, I'm going to
reggae on the river right then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, I like reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what's going on, but so,
and so Rue is an ambassador for James
[SPEAKER_00]: Lodgen X.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is our main ambassador.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the main one and we have flow garden
is the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's amazing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does hemp in Tennessee, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tennessee does amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's growing some of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pictures, great pictures,
great photographs does really good
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You great, you do great photographs for
home photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, yeah, I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be friends if you didn't have
good photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what really got me excited was
seeing your photos of the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for home girl, but we were on
the phone and talking, we do a monthly
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting where we talk about stuff and,
uh, but with the ambassadors and he
[SPEAKER_00]: promotes the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I try to pro out him and we
were talking about music and we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about reggae and I love reggae.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's one of my goes to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's when I was actually part of
the main music I listen to now,
[SPEAKER_02]: after I kind of got, you know,
off the, the booze and stuff, I stopped
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to my country music as much and
stuff going more towards the Rasta vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: More of the smoke weed and less of the
like, I'm sad cause I'm drunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm drunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no shit buddy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, reggae music definitely
embodies all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this, the spirit way more
uplifting, way more uplifting love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And happiness.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there is some,
you know, there is, they, they do sting
[SPEAKER_00]: about struggle too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but like most of the reggae,
it has a good beat to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can move to it and it's just good
vibrations, good energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just saying like, you know,
majority of reggae artists where they,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they come from, you know,
Jamaica or whatnot, they ain't got the
[SPEAKER_02]: great conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just goes to show you, man,
that you jamming good music, smoking some
[SPEAKER_02]: good ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably have a good attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, as you can see, it affects people and
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That just goes to show you, man,
uh, I, what it'll do for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it changes your mind on what you
think is good and bad and what you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, what you might actually need in
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think happiness is a choice too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can choose to be upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can choose to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, we can choose in the moment how we
want to, how we want to be and how we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to live our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's harder than other
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like at the same time, I feel like it
is a choice to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's obviously there's moments
where it's going to be tough and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have these emotions, but all that
stuff is a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reggae music definitely will put you
in the right mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, I hear it and I feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear it, you feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you just start grooving and
moving and just, man, puts a smile on my
[SPEAKER_02]: face and just brings me a happy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you flew in last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last Wednesday we hung out at the facility
a little bit and then, and then we drove
[SPEAKER_00]: up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was what?
[SPEAKER_02]: About a four hour drive from here or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I wasn't the one driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just riding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we got up there, set up camp and
man, yeah, the, the spot we had was just
[SPEAKER_02]: fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, thanks to Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Royal Gold, cutting edge,
but Royal Gold for the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick's an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick and his family, they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we love them, good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hooked us up with a beautiful spot
to camp in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, we were under a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the coolest place around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it looks cool, but I mean,
temperature wise, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, uh, it felt like,
uh, felt like home while we were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: It, uh, it felt like when we, when we were
leaving the booth or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like we're going home now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't spend too much time up in
Humboldt County because I'll end up moving
[SPEAKER_00]: up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta come back sooner than later
because I just, I love it up there and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people up there are just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, Rick from Royal Gold,
big shout out to Sean and John cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use one of their tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set up in the area with all those guys
and Sean's a wild man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean's a wild man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows how to party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows how to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's great for the company
and, and uncle John, he's contributed so
[SPEAKER_00]: much to our community and to our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just a really great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet him too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to meet uncle John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, he's a, he's a cool little
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, smart guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good at business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they've done really good with
their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they have a product they believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe in their product too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell they just have nothing but
good vibes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, just being, man,
that whole booth set up that whole link,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said, those two other booths next
to us, like just, man, you'd go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I've worked a little booths
before and you got crappy neighbors or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really feels like work the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, this is just right here on the river
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just in a booth instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was happening and having a good time
with those guys and everybody over there
[SPEAKER_02]: was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicky T another guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see Nicky T.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to meet Nicky T.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he was too tense down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did two DJ sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that set we saw was just,
he was on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, and he's just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, yeah, he also got to see
the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a sour diesel story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I got to, I get to meet this
guy, Dave and Dave's from up North and he
[SPEAKER_00]: came to me and he said, I got something to
show you if it's not the real one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't have hurt feelings, but just tell
me the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got some sour diesel to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, it was the real sour
diesel that I haven't seen for a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so much sour diesel over the
last year, but none of them were this
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, grown to this particular standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe it's the same cut where
you're going to test it genetically to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was as sour as it gets like the
real nose of sour diesel that was like not
[SPEAKER_00]: just burnt tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did have a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had the citrus back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like the citrus funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember smelling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicky T verified it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and my friend, Stevie verified it
yesterday and everybody's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, I can't believe you have that flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I can't remember if I smoked
it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did smoke some bongers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, uh, man, it tasted good,
but yeah, that the, when you let me smell
[SPEAKER_02]: it, I was, it was, uh, smelled really
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a super special one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dave also had the Nigerian haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another one that looked terrible,
but then you smoke it and it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones that creeps up on you,
gently lifts you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost look like, um, like a little
weeds or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like you pick up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was podgely and it was like these
little small, like just small,
[SPEAKER_00]: small racks that were like three inches
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: From each other on twigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the craziest looking weeds
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Landry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was your highlight of the whole
weekend?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, probably my most highlight was
seeing Marlon Asher perform live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't ever done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing him put on his show was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He puts on a great show to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, to me, he was the best singer
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got our, that's just my personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: His music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all the artists, they were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the artists, they were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, to me, that was special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen Marlon perform many,
many, many, many times and that sound was
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best I've ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made his voice sound even, even better
than his.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just on, on, you know, sometimes
when people were just on, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: sound system, the way his voice carried
over the crowd and where you could stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we were in the back and then we went
to the front and we're at the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we went to the other side and then we
were in the back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded good everywhere, but like his
voice was just perfect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and his band, he has this,
this band, they're newer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've been working together recently
and they just sounded amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The backup singer sounded great and you
could hear everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't getting meshed together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very distinct and just the,
the, the boombox sound instead of like
[SPEAKER_02]: when, you know, saying live sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too, like I said, too loud or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just mushes together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this was real, you know, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, like you could tell like
somebody took time and the sound people
[SPEAKER_02]: really did their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just sounded good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Reggie on the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all did a great, amazing job and,
uh, keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait for next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to bless one person a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want too many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person a year we're going to have come
with us and you just build.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just don't kick me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to bring the whole family next
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, uh, they were missing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if I could do that, that they might
even get hooked on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that get them to move there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the secret way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring them up for reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to go check it out for
reggae.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next thing you know, you're living
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're just going home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're flying home.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're driving home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: River stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right by the river stage.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so we started by rolling up 20
joints the first day.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20, 24, 24 joints.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the best way to start out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're saying joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, these are about an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about an eighth, uh, a joint
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, that's what he rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 of those first day got, got there,
started rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, got to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff you've been growing over the
last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been growing a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the industry a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen all the different stuff,
but over the last four years, what have
[SPEAKER_00]: been the highlights?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, highlights, uh, one of my,
like I said, I first started off,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the, like I said, I just got a small
little light, uh, of course I went the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I love growing marijuana route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you get the 10 by 10, which,
you know, it's, it's the ILGM.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, which I mean, like I said,
one of my favorite plants came from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's their hit or miss a little bit,
nothing against them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, to me, I went that route cause
like when you first hear, Oh, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have to kill plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to, you know,
this will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, Oh, I'll buy 10,
get 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, I got, I first started off
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I did grow a photo period from them,
uh, Zittles and, um, it came out nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of the first ones I would
say I had really good success with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, was theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then skills from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Z or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like one of the first plants I
started getting praise for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, people were like, Oh damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the fade, love the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so that would have been my first
little highlight that I loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, uh, but like I said, their genetics
aren't really consistent or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, I started drawing,
doing some other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had a, um, a Northern lights from
growers choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think was my next good successful one
that, uh, uh, it actually didn't look the
[SPEAKER_02]: best, but for, for me, I got fucking
weight off of it and it smoked great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's a true Northern
lights, but, uh, it, it, the effects were
[SPEAKER_02]: really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then, yeah, my necks were,
were yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that frosted biscotti that first try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, uh, I knew I was onto
something special when I got it
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully to do after I transplanted an
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody thought, I thought they were
photo periods, uh, transplant them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a highlight too, was that that
first success of, uh, of, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flower getting transplanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, so everything I've grown
from you, like I said, and then this last,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, one that has been really, I've been
getting the great, uh, great praise for is
[SPEAKER_02]: another, the gorilla Z's OG Cush cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, man, that the fate on that one has
just been amazing and the smoke on it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean that one flavor, a lot of
flavor, a lot, you know, a good effect and
[SPEAKER_02]: it looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that, the trifecta of what you want
in the, in weed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and so, yeah, I, I'd probably have to
say all in all that, yeah, that gorilla
[SPEAKER_02]: Z's OG Cush cross that last one,
I probably liked that last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't pinned on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have a picture of it kind of like,
uh, almost dried up a little bit after
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got one laying down or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a back, a black background,
trying to be a little more professional on
[SPEAKER_02]: my, uh, my photos there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but yeah, that one, like I said,
was just, it was probably the most
[SPEAKER_02]: highlighted one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like I said, your purple punch,
OG Cush cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I love that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, to me, the one I did,
it didn't pack as high as a punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the flavor on it, man,
I've never tasted anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only describe it like as a pickle
dill flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing else like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, and I mean, it's like you
sweet though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it's like a, uh, a sweet pickle to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, uh, like a regular pickle or
kosher or whatever you want to call it
[SPEAKER_02]: has, still has that, like a, uh,
a kick to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, when you hit it, it's like,
you hit it in that back of the throat and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, man, you, I, every time I
exhale on that one, um, I think pickle,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, it is just great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, all of the trifecta would be the
gorilla Zs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, like I said, all just that
flavor wise would be that purple punch,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I would just break off a
little pieces and put it in my bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if I went to the, I'll smoke in my
restroom for the, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had to use the restroom,
wash my hands or anything, I'd grab a
[SPEAKER_02]: little piece and just get that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last four years, what's the best
weed you ever seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Grown by other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was about to say that, that guava
cherry, probably not the best I seen,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that was, that was special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's one other, I can't remember
what it was called off hand, but man,
[SPEAKER_02]: the structure on it was like, you just had
like a, like a little buds together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the aroma off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I can't remember.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so much good stuff this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much good stuff that we were
consuming this weekend that it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming hard to recollect sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those entries for the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canifest, we got to try all those entries
last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we went through nine out of the
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we hit that last one,
but, but we did try nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did our pretty good entries,
pretty good entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good ros, we had good rosin and smoke all
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were dabbing, smoking flour,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabbing and dabbing and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That little dipper dabber you have is one
of the best inventions since slice bread,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little dipper, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it too convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just open your jar right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or your friend's jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your friend's jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about your grow
setup, how you, how you're doing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you've, cause you do, you use soil and you
also do like a hydro setup, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having more success in my hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I run five gallon buckets and I,
I was going to do like the, the RRW or
[SPEAKER_02]: RDWC, the recirculating.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I find it better and easier just to do
whatever we call bubble buckets or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, where I just, I drill a hole on
my side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the air hose in there, drop an air
stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just change it weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I'm using rise nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I think I'm going to try a cutting
edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to run theirs next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I do that and I have great
success with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, of course soil always tastes
a little bit better and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my soil, but I also, you know,
I think there's a place for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was saying like the,
once you are for me, once I saw the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, how quickly the rapid rate of,
of these plants growing in the hydro just
[SPEAKER_02]: blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about it because I first started
off with cocoa and then I really,
[SPEAKER_02]: for some reason I couldn't get that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just wasn't going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I switched the soil and actually had a
pretty good success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I kind of, got funky on that for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was trying to learn too much at
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just canvas, canvas, canvas,
canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should start out with soil because
there's a buffer and I like soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of things about soil,
but I do like the buffer that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas hydro, you screw things up,
you can kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it can be just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you, and then cocoa,
if you're talking about cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's completely inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, uh, that doesn't have
anything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to feed it properly right from the
get-go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can overfeed it or
underfeed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these questions where soil
it's like, there's this little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer and you use good soil and it's a
great place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, you know, everyone has their
opinion on how to start, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is just an easy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Rockwell, I think takes,
it's, it's like the Ferrari, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in some ways, like as far as not
everybody knows how to drive a Ferrari and
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes a long time to learn how to drive
a Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you learn how to drive a Ferrari,
it goes really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Rockwell has its place for
certain things like, especially mothers
[SPEAKER_00]: and clones, especially mothers and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then DWC, I've seen great flower come
out of DWC, my friend, Alfred master Yoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the king of DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's won many, many cups with his culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the master Yoda Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's a, he's just an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an amazing grower, but I mean,
there's so many different ways you can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow so many different substrates you can
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to keep the hydro buckets and
soil in my garden all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I said, I, I won't ever, I won't ever
kick either one of those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, uh, I said, so I have my
closet, um, which, um, I, I've,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've edged there for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I've been doing 16 hours when I get
back and I'm bumping up the 20 hours for
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta go 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the, you get the most
yield and benefit, even though it costs a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more for your, you know,
for your veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, same thing like veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I veg it 20 hours too, but that that's
irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever, but like I veg a
little bit longer stuff like blue dream
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used to have back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did less than 20, there's a chance
that it would kick into flower a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the clones wouldn't be as healthy,
but, uh, I would say that for auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, you get the best bang for the
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buck at 20 for yield and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like, why have to pay more for
electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: It pays for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a better yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get better structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got me excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause dude, like I said, uh, like I said,
I don't even, people ask me why I run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't run even 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run 16 hours and the results I'm getting
off your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still get good results,
but at 20, I think it's even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's saying you're getting me
super excited about seeing these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll find the 18 is better for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't like auto flowers and they
do it at 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why you got to use more
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of the auto flower is
you can keep the light on and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to stress out the plants
going to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think people grow their auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I do like in the same tent,
same environment, but they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're flipping that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when one half of the time they're
growing it, it's getting 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 to 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it's getting 1212
when, you know, that's not what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: designed for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed to get the exact same amount
of light you're giving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't need to be flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can grow them in Alaska where
it doesn't get dark for that period of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year and it won't affect their flower
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, auto flowers are pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, uh, people, people bash on
them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of people to bash on them,
but it's like such a personal preference
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what people don't understand is
maybe they're not not the right choice for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but for a lot of people out there,
they like auto flowers, auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some companies that make millions
of dollars a month on selling auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because they're, because they're good
to, to for certain environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain people, for certain
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to just have a plant that you
grow on your windowsill and you live in
[SPEAKER_02]: Barcelona, correct auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you don't really need a light
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I mean, yeah, they're just,
they're just amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I said, you can all in my one
area, like I said, my, my, I converted a
[SPEAKER_02]: walk-in closet to, uh, to my veg area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you from, to my wife for letting me
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually a functional closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had clothes hanging in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I first took over the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I took over a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was talking about, I need more tents
and maybe, uh, building something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she finally gave me permission to
just take it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I took over that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I love having that, like I said,
in that area, I have my veg and seedlings
[SPEAKER_02]: there and then I have my auto flowers that
are in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that whole setup right there,
I get to see the whole, basically the life
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle of the flower, uh, you know,
of the plant and then I transplanted,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a four by four, where's my flower
tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, if you ever seen my podcast,
see the harvest podcast, uh, if you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: seen that one where I sit behind me is
that, that's the tent though, right behind
[SPEAKER_02]: me is that four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll, uh, I'll just take them from,
you know, from there and transplant them
[SPEAKER_02]: over and then flip them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have a AC unit that sits right out
outside of it to, uh, can control the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, when everything turns on,
I open my stuff up and like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just start talking my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of lights are you using right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have two, uh, spider farmer SBF,
uh, 1000s, I think, uh, just two of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have a, a bar light on the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what I got from my
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what company is from,
but it's actually pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you measuring PPFD?
[SPEAKER_00]: You measure your par?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't need to get par meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Sarah right now with my,
my, uh, my, uh, spider farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're the old ballast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to take them off and readjust
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so I don't even know if I'm at 50 or
40 really, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I need to get a meter to adjust those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so right now, like I said,
I'm not even, uh, trying to measure all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's hard for me to, uh,
change the lighting system on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't try to, I'll probably just
drive myself crazy, honestly, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I actually, I keep those two,
uh, spider farmers cranked up to a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: percent and I just adjust their height.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I think, dude, and I really haven't
read and ran into any problems doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: so far, uh, a couple of plants and maybe
stretched a little bit more than I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but until I really can get more money
to get more system, I need to get a light
[SPEAKER_02]: that has some under canopy next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Faving, faving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might even have some for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I need to get that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, like I said, I have a bar
light on the side and then in my,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my tent, I have a, a fluent slide and
that's just, man, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that also for my brother,
but that thing hits every corner of that
[SPEAKER_02]: four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's packed in there and
that one has the little, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the adjusting, like you can go from one,
two, three, four, five, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: saying it all the way to a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that lights bad-ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, I, I, when I go in there,
I probably start off about 50% or so on
[SPEAKER_02]: that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I probably crank it up to about
85% or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've had to do anything a
hundred percent in there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you try to keep your temperature
and humidity at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I try to keep the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays about like 74 to 76 or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I freak out if it gets close to 80%,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know my head and everything will
be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the temperature or humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, temperature, temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like keep it a little lower temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, I only have the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I'm at in my, you don't worry
about too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was actually tripping over more than
anything when they were out there in my
[SPEAKER_02]: closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays, uh, cause I have so many plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the buckets in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays about 60%, 55 to 60% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the flower tent, um, will stay roughly
about the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it will drop when I had cut the
AC off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I, that AC itself creates
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I don't really have to worry about
it really spiking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't create, you know, I'm saying
it's not a humidifier that doesn't just
[SPEAKER_02]: bust out like, um, you know, spits,
you know, spits of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, like I said, just naturally I'm
sitting about six, uh, 50 to 60% humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: on both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if a storm comes in or something,
one time we did go get a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a whole bunch of stuff flowering and
drying at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it did dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did dry to actually, I think it helped
me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It rained for like a week, but luckily it
hit like when I first started doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you first dry anyways,
it's you're hitting about 60% humidity or
[SPEAKER_02]: so right next to the plant that I've seen,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I normally dry in a cardboard box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't have a dry room or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I do it as I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I either I make like a makeshift wall out
in my upstairs living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I need to work on that,
but yeah, I'll, I can do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in the room and the, the room
temperature of my bedroom stays probably
[SPEAKER_02]: about like 60, 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, when the lights are in the
flower tent, it probably gets up to about
[SPEAKER_02]: like 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my nighttime temps, uh,
probably hit about like a 68, 69 or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not too much fluctuation with no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the, the, uh, the barrier,
like I said, I have that AC right outside
[SPEAKER_02]: that flower tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it would maybe get colder in
there than it does that would actually get
[SPEAKER_02]: to like the 60 degrees and just having
that tent in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those, those plants make heat,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a living, they're a living thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're creating heat themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, well, and the light definitely
creates some heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying with lights off,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought maybe it'd get colder like
around 60, but it's insulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the tents are thicker than you think
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, like I said, mainly I control my
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I said, uh, my bedroom is above
a garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever they did to try to insulate or
didn't insulate between the garage and our
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's hot, uh, in that garage,
it just goes through the, uh, the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I even started growing,
our bedroom would be in like summertime,
[SPEAKER_02]: like 75, maybe 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when the, the AC trying to cool
it down to 72 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it would just like come through
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I gotta keep that AC on all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, it'll just, it really does spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the last thing you want is hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, uh, anybody that's been following me
for like, I went to Disneyland or Disney
[SPEAKER_02]: world like two years ago in my,
right before I left my AC broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a video of help me, help me,
help me tell me what to do people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I said, I was only growing for like
two, two years at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing temperatures of 92 in my tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, luckily I made it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, everything got harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: 92 is better than 102.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 92 you can, you can survive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did, they survived that,
you know, uh, well too, it wasn't what
[SPEAKER_02]: really freaked me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is two or three days before we had to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to tell somebody how to take
care of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: My plants and then they're dealing with
the heat issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm like freaking out about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, man, just the,
the, the extra stress of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you had anybody try to
take care of your plants, but you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, you do this, you do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say something wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you gotta do it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, so yeah, that was just
freaking out that something would have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they'd mess something up a hair
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just, uh, the temperature itself
would have just killed them, but they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they made it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I left to go,
I was going snowboarding, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is when I was 17 and I had an
apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going snowboarding and I had my
buddy watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had three guys, there was three of
us living in a one bedder apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the main room bedroom and the closet
was mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had plants in there and I had my buddy
and I'm like one tablespoon of fish
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsion with a gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All he heard was gallon and fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was like, well, I just put a
gallon of fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so write stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to write stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed tasted like salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, somebody ended up buying it not for a
lot of money, but they bought it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it and they were like, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I would smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like some salmon weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, not salmon Creek, big bud,
but salmon bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't flush it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no flushing that much salmon and
it was towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went and harvested, but yeah,
you gotta be real specific and write stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people taking care of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I had a closet girl and this
was, you know, 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're 17, that's 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I keep notebooks for everything I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I write down in my notebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend everybody get a notebook
if you're growing, especially like I have
[SPEAKER_02]: so many sisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying this, trying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta keep on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one, you know, when you change them,
if I don't let them go longer than a week,
[SPEAKER_02]: when, you know, when they start
stretching, you gotta change them every
[SPEAKER_02]: other day, every three days depends on the
strain or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't let them go longer than
a week in my bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I write everything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know when I changed it, when I,
you know, if I have soil, going maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, strange drink differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you might not have to water
this one every time that you water the
[SPEAKER_02]: other two or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it is to me, is very important
to have a notebook, write stuff down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way, if your buddy has to take
care of it, like I do, I write the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: I write this, I write, I put nine inches
in my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything should be kind of
logged in what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have automated equipment,
but it's still, we record everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not hand doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and we still do check stuff by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, especially calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Machines can need calibration too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing pH or EC, you should
calibrate those regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We calibrate them before we use them every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we used to be once a week and now
it's like, we calibrate them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're comparing them and one is
different, then there's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to investigate why that's
different because that could throw
[SPEAKER_00]: everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and it's like, are we
measuring runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: We check for runoff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what the runoff is testing
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is the plant eating?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going through?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the pH changing in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is, I mean, those are the little
telltale signs that you have issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all these monitoring systems now
that we have, like, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I can get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like you said, all the data and
all the problems you can search for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's just, it's great so we
can get the best results out of this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which should, you know, this is what this
plant deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more information you have,
the more you have an opportunity to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: better decision on what you're going to do
moving forward and how to adjust stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more data you're working with,
the better, it paints a better picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also having someone who's,
you know, better than myself, look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and go, dude, what are you doing
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or dude, you could try doing this and
maybe this will improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just different set of eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different thoughts, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Different ideas that can come out of
sharing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to too many people's advice
and try to combine it all, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: screw everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to listen to one person's
advice, do all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't really work,
switch to a different person and follow
[SPEAKER_00]: that to the T.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually you'll build your own
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could ask for a little bit of
advice and you can change one thing at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time and see, well, does that help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that not help?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a long term thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people don't understand
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's just like from cycle to
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there's a commitment to
the plant that you're making by growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and to learn how to grow really well or to
learn how to do any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lifetime, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not masters, like four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for a long time and
I'm not a master by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I have some friends that are
way better at the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be better at seed production and I
might be better at this or reversals and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have our own niche, but like it's
great when you can bounce ideas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also having the data to where this is
what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: GrowSense, we use GrowSense from Growdan
and we use their sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like these things, their eGrow
software and the GrowSense sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, these things are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agritech, and we have redundancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do we use one, we're using
multiple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in a beautiful time where we can
use two different things and then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: compare the data and go, okay,
something's wrong here, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like you said, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you say, like people kind of
specialize in their own little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why like you, everybody like
say you do ideas off them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it helps, you know,
if you're not so good at something,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get a little advice and help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said not everybody might not be
the best at everything, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to help each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then writing stuff down,
also when I need feedback on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like on genetics or something like that,
if you have it all written down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can tell me what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of being able to
help other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean, writing it down to like,
if somebody's like, oh, dang, you had
[SPEAKER_02]: great results.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, I don't know offhand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can go back and look at it and tell
them, you know, oh, I had to, I did,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it weekly for this long and then
whatever I, so I had to start swapping
[SPEAKER_02]: them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like when I run my hydro nutrients,
I'll, I'll do a good week of veg still,
[SPEAKER_02]: or at least maybe not a week, but about
five days, I'll do, I'll run them straight
[SPEAKER_02]: and still the veg nutrients for about five
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I swap to a half and half of veg
bloom for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go straight to the veg or
bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, I was saying that's just
stuff I learned too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's helps that you write stuff
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if somebody was asking,
Hey, what do you, what do you run them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And which people have asked me before what
nutrients are running my buckets and how I
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've helped the few people out
and that's, I couldn't help them out if I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have never known what to tell
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause by the time they're seeing it and
they want to know what I did on something
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the plan I grew months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30 years ago, there wasn't a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and a lot of recipes you get from
nutrients and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would actually have to go in and
figure out your own recipe and be
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of stuff that like,
cause the recipes that they gave you on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could do three part from GH
and that would give you consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that wasn't the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got you through, but how can we improve
this dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, you can use cutting
edge, like uncle John cutting edge,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's cutting edge, united
frontline, Athena, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can house and house and garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all these companies, if you follow
the recipes that you get from these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, you will typically get good
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like just following T
basically just following step by step from
[SPEAKER_00]: what they give you, you're going to get
good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas 30 years ago, even 20 years ago,
that wasn't necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need a little bit of liquid
karma or we use dark energy or these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use these to get better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still do some of that stuff,
but a lot of times just right out the
[SPEAKER_00]: gate, you can follow the recipe that's on
the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, like when I first started off
to one of my first, while I did the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a Fox farm and you know,
they're, they're a little nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, it wasn't super,
like I said, it will get you through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think it gets you to a good spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, that, uh, to know if you like
this or not, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, like I said, all you gotta do is
the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like companies like Kana and these
other companies, they, they, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can name all the nutrient
companies we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of them spend tons of money on
research and development to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing recipe that works really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then it's just a personal
preference of what do I like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want it to taste amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want it to look amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think they all have different
boxes that they check when you use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, like I said, you can,
you can start tweaking that, that recipe a
[SPEAKER_02]: hair, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go crazy and just half
nutrients or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, I just use the stock
recipes and you might adjust a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and we, I have a guy that
comes in and helps me do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's much better than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, cause just, if you're,
if you're doing 50, 50 on something,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a two-part, you want to go 60,
40.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a straight 60, 40,
because there's this amazing change that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens when you do it and it doesn't
adjust perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chemical change that happens when you
add the a to the B.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you, you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60, 40 of a and B of one of the other or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're running like a 60,
40, let's say we're doing 50, 50 United as
[SPEAKER_00]: an example, cause we're using,
I mean, we do, we're an R and D facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we test everybody's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're using United right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went from a 50, 50, and we were
getting a little bit of stretch and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were getting tip burning right with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just straight 50, 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had our guy who works with
United.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came in and he's like, we should
probably just try a 60, 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go 60, 40 and see how that does
with what, what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to lower it from three EC
down to 2.5 EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go a little bit lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to go 60,
40, and we'll see how it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they recommended to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a calculation that he used to help
us get to that perfect 60, 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's not when you're titrating these
things, it's not just straight away
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's great having somebody,
I mean, and this is following their
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and another thing is, like you said,
you reached out to a nutrient line or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're having problems, man,
call these people, call these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Text them, hit them a message on
Instagram, whatever they will get back to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them will get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These companies care about their
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want people to be their customers,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think customer service is half
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a business and you want to be
successful, customer service is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, I run the Rise
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my first time doing hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got them for soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I was doing other soil
nutrients at the time, but I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: start my buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hit them a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was just on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just left them a voice message saying,
Hey, I got your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these good for hydro buckets?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they text me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they started a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that's how I'm going to feel it
for them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start talking to these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get some oil, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be as shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're having problems with
your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and if you're buying a product,
you want to get the best results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with hitting up the
manufacturer and going, okay, how can I
[SPEAKER_00]: make this the best it could be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, I mean, I do like a TV or
something that wasn't working that you
[SPEAKER_02]: thought was supposed to operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go back and say, Hey dude,
this TV ain't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: The volume doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you go back and say,
Hey dude, these nutrients ain't working
[SPEAKER_02]: the way I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, well, they'll ask you,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's once again, write it down so you
can tell them the correct and accurate
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're telling them something wrong and
they tell you to try to correct it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that wasn't even the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many little things that beyond
the recipe, like if you're filtering your
[SPEAKER_00]: water, like filtering for chlorine or
whatever, using a basic filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're going to run, it's going to
run a different pH coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have pH issues that you're not,
sometimes you need pH up, sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: need pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on where you're located
in the country in the time of year,
[SPEAKER_00]: your EC basically can fluctuate,
your EC and your pH can fluctuate just
[SPEAKER_00]: from using city water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just use tap water and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sit it out, dechlorinate for 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, I'll, I just have to pH down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally after I dechlorinate it,
let it sit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like eight, three ish, mainly is what
I normally get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes eight, you know, you always got
to check it is the best thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's mine's always about eight
and I always just, I just dechlorinated
[SPEAKER_02]: all it sit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your EC coming out of the tap?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have an EC near.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm, I'm the kiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it simple, stupid for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I like learning and I learn about
certain things that I'm, I need to at
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but that's saying if, if I'm not
running into the problem at the time I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying, I don't need extra stuff in my
head, I guess, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got too much stuff bouncing around as it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, like I said, I haven't even had
to go down that road.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have asked me all the time,
you know, all these questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, I don't monitor that
stuff, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, what, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, let's talk about your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you also do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the harvest podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me, the harvest podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes on Saturdays, 5 30 central
time on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the three of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually were the two that came up
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were bouncing ideas off of each other
for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to get something started.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started off on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked me one week if I'd be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, yeah, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like me and L first started, we were
messaging and hang, you know, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: helping each other back and forth for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he knew can roll out Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they started and they asked me if
I'd jump on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah, we're having problems with
the Instagram, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we only did a couple episodes
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we moved to YouTube having way more
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're at like 500 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For six months now or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is season one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew out the, uh, Pannonia glue skies
from, uh, crop culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, we're having fun with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, it's the three of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, like I said, they were doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked me to be on and, uh,
the, the, the, it's the slogan is grow
[SPEAKER_02]: with the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you can get the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, uh, the thing is we'll give
you the German nation, uh, date when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: germinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a, it's a community thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get people to come along
and grow their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have questions or you're scared to
start growing, this is what we're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's what they, uh,
put it together for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think L is the one that actually came up
with the seed, the harvest podcast name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, just, you know, the,
the idea of it, of, you know, helping
[SPEAKER_02]: people to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's grow with the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you, you grow with us at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're running into a problem,
uh, you, it's not just us, hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more people in the community that
you can reach out to and you can ask them,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, this is happening with this genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all running the same genetics,
same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're checking it out to see what
different environments do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Texas, L's in Arizona and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris is in count, you know, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but yeah, so we're, you know,
this whole thing is just a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different environments, different people
testing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so we invite you to come on and grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: With this and you have, you're scared of
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a great opportunity for
you to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's like I said, you'll, you can grow
with a group of people at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the exact same thing, uh, you're going
to maybe ask somebody what nutrient the
[SPEAKER_02]: lines they're using or whatever to help
you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have, you find out they're
doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got more of a person to help you
through or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I guarantee you, anybody that you
ask that's with our podcasts or one of
[SPEAKER_02]: our, you know, our regulars, dude,
they'll, they'll definitely help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's, how long is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do about three hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we do an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some of them have gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've had a couple guests on the
go hour and a half or so, uh, roughly an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour is what we keep or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not super, super long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like I said, if some reason somebody
wants to jump on, we, we share a link.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, uh, jump in whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to share a link regularly,
but you can come on and show your grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so yeah, like I said,
we're there to help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, it's, it's trying to be a
community thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's trying to get more people in and,
uh, just, yeah, help them grow weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: help them grow their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, uh, when we were at this
show, everybody, we walked, everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: walking by us to go to the dispensary
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dude, grow your own cannabis,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never, it's so rewarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put some hash out for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, people, some people were
definitely thinking it's too good to be
[SPEAKER_02]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, this is a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the one dude finally asked me,
he's like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hash, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, can I take it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah, dude, take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was still like, while he was grabbing,
he was like, Oh hell, something's about to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ain't even the right dudes for this
tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else's tent right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just giving shit away.
Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about sobriety a little bit
for you, you know, with, with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with our audience, because I feel like
there's a lot of people either struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: with sobriety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're interested in how do I get clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I stay clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a good example of someone who can
go to a reggae show and be around alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually took a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're struggling, dude,
keep trying, keep trying, keep trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've had problems like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 44 now since I was 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 30 years, I've pretty much,
well now I've been clean for a while now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've struggled with it numerous times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried and I've all, every time I was
doing that, I take a night off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just sit home and smoke weed and
that felt so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I felt like who I was, uh,
just from where I came from, I felt like
[SPEAKER_02]: that was, that is what I had to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I felt like in the morning when I,
I, I drank first thing in the morning,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I open up a bottle and I'd,
I'd stare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even want to drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think maybe right at that point,
it has to, you have to get to a point
[SPEAKER_02]: where you are fucking sick and tired of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, at that last end, I was like,
I'd look at that bottle and, and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's just fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, like I said, it's, and it's not
even just the actual cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at first I just still just,
you know, getting cannabis from people and
[SPEAKER_02]: now it's helping me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but man, without the growing that
changes, I've never been so happier in my
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never really been so much happier in
my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like I said, just drinking all the
time, waking up with a hangover,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, thinking you got to do these drugs to
get through the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you got to hang over your drinking
constantly throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it just, it's takes a toll on your
body for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without cannabis, I would not,
I would not be where I'm at for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, yeah, I can, I can sit,
see people drink now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it doesn't affect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're around it all weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: People drinking around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the first year when I did it was
hard a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing people, uh, I I'm seeing people
drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they're having a fun time,
but I guarantee the next morning they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people can have fun on booze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know how to control myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, once the, once that train leads to
station, uh, it's hard to stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was a drinker that did not like to
be told to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not like bottle counting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me when to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how much have you been drinking a
day?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, I hated it,
but I mean, that's just people looking out
[SPEAKER_02]: after you, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: People are concerned because you're,
you're slowly killing yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you're, you're, you're polluting your
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mean, one of the first things that
people would ask me, they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for bitch ass sissies for one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, to me, I expect that I do believe
that to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it makes you weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think people consume it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it makes you weaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it just, it's not good for your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you blues all the time,
you'll, you'll definitely feel it in your
[SPEAKER_02]: body for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's definitely not for me no more
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it ever really was for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, like I said, I thought that's what
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cannabis in general is,
it makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think alcohol, uh, in a lot of ways does
the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people, there are people that
can have a good time on alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't judge people either way to each
their own, but like, so cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for making the world a better
place and, you know, leaving something to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next generation and trying to lead by
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always lead by example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, we can strive for the
best we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all human beings where nobody's
perfect, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's perfect is imperfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's, that's, that's a perfect
saying right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's, if you try to reach
perfection of whatever you're thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to drive yourself crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the goal is perfection,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to, we want to strive to be the
best we can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the way, if you make mistakes,
you want to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want gradual improvement.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the goal is to gradually
improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, you know, I drank this weekend
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm trying not to drink as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm actually achieving what I'm
trying to do is by not drinking as much
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of people online that I
talked to that I, uh, I've helped out that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, um, uh, he, he posted
something and he was like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, so many years down the drain,
he posted his drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I actually, we're pretty good
friends now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just told him, I said, dude,
um, I said, it's not about the time that
[SPEAKER_02]: you weren't drinking and that you just
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about what you're going to do after
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fucked one day up, you drank,
you probably feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So use this as a reminder for one thing
and get back at it and don't fucking drink
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it happens again, you just,
you know, you're a human being and all you
[SPEAKER_02]: can do is work on yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes don't be too hard on
yourself while you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the best pieces of
advice for people is don't be too hard on
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you fuck up, as long as you
recognize that you fucked up and made a
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake and, and try to move forward from
that, whether it's alcohol or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I'd use as a crud or an
excuse for when I, when I would try to get
[SPEAKER_02]: clean and sober, um, I'd maybe do it for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I start drinking and whatever,
I'm like, well, fuck it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm a, I'm a drinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't control myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, I'm actually exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you mess up, you're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct it and try to, you know,
correct it for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of AA personally,
and I think it works for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great for certain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, well, I mean, maybe here too,
cause like in Texas, if you work it over
[SPEAKER_02]: there and you tell them what I'm doing,
you're not working a program because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using cannabis or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can change smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do AA either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, and if you need it, there's nothing
wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great for certain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the structure of it,
whatever it's perfect for some people is
[SPEAKER_00]: just not, not my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had friends that have had great
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been sober, you know, for,
for 20 years, you know, from AA and they
[SPEAKER_00]: still go to meetings and that's great for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an AA member or I don't go to AA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I don't, I've tried it before
and like half the time, half those people
[SPEAKER_02]: in there are getting sent there cause
they're on paper or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it before where I've,
I've been sent there cause I was in
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble and same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've looked up with people and there's
been times where I go there actually
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found my own and I ended up leaving with
somebody drinking and drugging that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start, I've heard that story a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started telling war stories and you
know, saying sometimes some won't have,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will try to tell you, don't tell the
war stories or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just talk about what happened,
but it's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're with a group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to do their own thing
and try to do what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like I said, majority of my,
and my feeling is I guarantee you about
[SPEAKER_02]: half those people are forced to be there
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, and I think the, it's the right
path for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all different and there's nothing
wrong with trying everything and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously you tried all the drugs
and you tried all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying all the different ways to get
sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with going to
church.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that God will save you or
the, if you think that maybe that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: something that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think spiritualism and religion
and all these things are great,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and can be amazing tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, you can find spiritualism in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can find a spiritual path in
cannabis or psychedelics or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing wrong with that
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things are great ways to try to
heal yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at the end of the day, we're all
just trying to heal ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you can get on the path like the
you're on where you've healed yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, it's, it is healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing that's
contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, when I see you being sober,
I'm like, cool, I can hang out with Ru and
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I did have a couple of drinks
over the weekend, I'm not going to beat
[SPEAKER_00]: myself up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I had some beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The abuse we give ourselves normally is
some of the worst, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: What we tell ourselves and yeah,
you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try better next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what you're shooting for,
it's yeah, you'll get through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we're, we're always our worst
critic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one piece of advice for the younger
generation that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want something to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I wanted to grow cannabis,
but what I did is I moved a couple,
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved my shirts out of the way,
out of the closet that was already my
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hung that light there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you just got to do it and try.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not trying what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, are you just really that content
with what you're already doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And even, like I said, I'm love growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not content with whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I need to get my dry room
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can improve on the, on my drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's where I want to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you have to give it your all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to people, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're trying to put you down and be
negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to the naysayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to naysayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are, they're rooting you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they have good, you know,
information for you or suggestions,
[SPEAKER_02]: take it and try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, sometimes it's not for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to try something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
