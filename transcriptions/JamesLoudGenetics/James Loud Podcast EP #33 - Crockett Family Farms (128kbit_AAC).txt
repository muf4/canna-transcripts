[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, my special guests are Dave and
Brian from Crockett Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having us on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate you guys coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have been making seeds together
for a long time and you've been making
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds for a long time and you've been
working with your father for quite some
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about 11 years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I turned 18 legally, I started,
you know, working.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a kid, I was always involved,
you know, digging holes and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the young backbreaking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you start out at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're in a kitchen,
the best way to learn how to cook and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else is to start at the bottom
as a dishwasher and learn your way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think same thing with growing and
being a water boy at some point in your
[SPEAKER_02]: life is pretty important, you know,
like learning how to hand water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care how much automation you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's something to be said for
learning how to hand water properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's there's stuff that
automation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can work with drybacks and all
these other things, but there's something
[SPEAKER_02]: special about hand water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just understanding, you know,
all the positions all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to learn is to learn
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and have a real well-rounded
understanding of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, especially when you get a scale
like you guys have a farm, you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: know when people don't show up or
whatever, you need to know how to fill in
[SPEAKER_02]: the gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the gaps, how to train new people
and, you know, just to be able to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: around and kind of at a glance,
see what people are doing and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if it's correct or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim Jail is an important place to go for
part of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No windows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there is a point where I used to
sleep next to my plants when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming them, you know, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd have stuff in the bed and I
have allergies now that I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's important to learn how to
trim and learn how to trim efficiently and
[SPEAKER_02]: learning that like if you can trim one
gram in one minute, that's a pound of
[SPEAKER_02]: flour in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was always my example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when I started trimming,
you know, it wasn't even really a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like if you got invited because
I'm going to harvest or somebody is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest some weed, you know,
and this is way before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to call them trim parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're lucky if I feed you like
you're you're you're going to go home with
[SPEAKER_00]: some really good green, you know,
some really good bud that's not available
[SPEAKER_00]: to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some scissorhashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it turned into a, you know,
a whole circus at some points,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with some of these bigger
harvests and outdoor harvests,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you have to have 20,
30 people there camping out, doing all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of, you know, it's sometimes
sleeping out for months into February,
[SPEAKER_02]: March.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've seen that before in some
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've seen some workers that
just are pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get up in the morning and trim
till they go to bed and they'll do that
[SPEAKER_02]: for seven days in a row for months
straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few people that that,
you know, good people that would come up
[SPEAKER_00]: and take it real seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and make some pretty good money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was their only form of,
you know, money for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would make enough to survive on
the year by trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people come from other countries
and rock it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all they did for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come trim and then they travel the
rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think trimming prices were more
expensive back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell tell me how you got started in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a long, complex story,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, a 30,000 foot view.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was kind of born into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family were growers before me growing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a it was a different type
of situation back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can get in really serious
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my family members did go to jail
and prison for different things at
[SPEAKER_00]: different points.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, all the way up into the,
you know, 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even some after, you know,
when even after 215 passed, there was some
[SPEAKER_00]: people still go into jail without cards
and doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I mean, I kind of grew up in
the culture and in more of a more coveted
[SPEAKER_00]: culture back then, you know, saying that
you were a grower wasn't just like showing
[SPEAKER_00]: up and clocking in and going into a five
million dollar facility and doing the job
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had trained you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, being a grower was was
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was being able to to successfully pull
off a crop after the year and trim it and
[SPEAKER_00]: store it and sell it and everything and
survive by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just it was almost it was just
a different type of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was like there were there was
there was not as many growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was and it was harder to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a more special thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knew somebody, if you knew some
growers up on the mountain and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you could make a living off
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go up and get, you know,
bud and take it back and sell it for 50
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks an eighth or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, in the 90s and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that'd be like 400 bucks today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but it was, you know, and that was
when, you know, 50 bucks an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, minimum wage is probably
three or four dollars an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a whole, it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to to spend that much money for
that small amount when everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking, you know, pressed or brick weed
or or whatever, that's so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people held genetics so close to tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't let it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it wasn't there wasn't the
circulation of genetics like there is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any even regions like even like in
Jamaica, like like Orange Hill and these
[SPEAKER_00]: different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like that here,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was there was certain fan like,
oh, families are crews or people and areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that were more famous for specific
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you know, I heard on your
other podcast, you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, like the Oregon blueberry that
was a specific place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, over time, the cut gets
out and it gets wherever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that cut, I haven't seen around very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I actually lived in Oregon for a while
and the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow, but the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Trinity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinity is more well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other ones, you know, there was a
corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the corn and it had to look like
corn on the cob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, different places have
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We in our area, you know, it was more of a
citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had we were always dealing with the
Calio and we had like these citrus skunks
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, different hazes a lot back
then when I was younger, younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't in charge of any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was just kind of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What area was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're above Fresno in the in the right
below the Kings Canyon National Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's kind of southern
Sierras.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like Sierra Foothills ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a really great microclimate where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get any rain from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the end of April till
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super dry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super dry and we can escape the heat
from the elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very, very specific
microclimate that does really well for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And greenhouse, anything, you know,
that depends on the on the weather.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of genetics were you guys
working with back in the 80s?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of skunk, a lot of like,
like I say, like Calio, skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, there there was a few
varieties that they would get just from
[SPEAKER_00]: good brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because back then there were
like I'm talking about when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were we didn't have indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was off your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're literally crawling through
the mountains and running water lines off
[SPEAKER_00]: of creeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and growing very, very different than
you would today or even the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every year they would just start
everything with seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cloning didn't go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning didn't really go on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there there was indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was when you were going to grow
outside, it was always from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would start them every year and
you would make your own seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that was one of my very first
jobs that I ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was making the seed because I couldn't I
couldn't go to the out to the crops
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was too young and I would think
I was going to get in trouble or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around our house, we had different
areas that were one specific area that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would plant and leave a male in and make
seeds for the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would literally be like one male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would make enough seeds for,
you know, all we needed was a few
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had to do some good selections on
that male, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always had help with all that stuff,
but I was in charge of like watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping, you know, getting it going and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we would grow from seed and a
lot of the seed would just be,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I say, made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one year, if if you didn't make a good
selection and it did or it just didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: take well, that would that was the next
year's whole deal almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we would have a few different
spots that had a few different varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was mostly very vanilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was very like this spot has this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This spot has this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, hey, there's a bunch of
different things in here and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And names weren't as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd you'd kind of have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time when you'd get a
name, it was from somebody else or a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of people calling it something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we we had the Calio for a long time
and people call it the Cheeto Bud because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very orange haired and like bright
orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would just name these things
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's it just stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wasn't like, hey,
I I put these things together and I call
[SPEAKER_00]: it this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really happen like the lineages
weren't as well understood or I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe they were better understood because
there was less lineage to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, everyone's got to have all
these names and they're related and not
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but really at the end of the day,
the focus should be on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the the quality is is what's
going to make or break you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can survive by just putting
out some par flower, especially back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess it might have even been
easier back then because the only real
[SPEAKER_00]: competition you had was brickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I mean, I think you could grow
some shitty weed up until about five years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago and you were probably doing OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people got by on mediocre
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mids dusty mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but those guys have most of them have
went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, with the the the laws and
the regulations kind of clamping down and
[SPEAKER_00]: making it a little bit more, you know,
risky to to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then if you're not very good and
the competition is so stiff, it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: even with genetics, all these things,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with genetics, there's more
seed companies now than I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year, there's so much more because I
think a lot of people see the value in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anybody can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making great genetics is a whole
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a big difference between
seed production and breeding for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you always want to breed for
quality if you're doing seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a whole different thing when
you're actually making packs of seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: put out to people for me anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with seed production,
I focus on on different types of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, structure flowering time and not
only flowering time, but when it will come
[SPEAKER_00]: in outside, you know, you have a 60 day
flowering plant versus a 50 day flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're like, well, this one's going
to I'm going to harvest this one 10 days
[SPEAKER_00]: before I harvest this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not true outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's when that initiates flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can have a haze that takes
100 days inside and it could be done
[SPEAKER_00]: October 10th because it initiated in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have something that that is,
you know, 60 days and it's not done till
[SPEAKER_00]: Halloween like the strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when did you start getting into selling
seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you worked with DNA, but were you
doing stuff with seeds before you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of started working together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold them kind of in bulk, not in
packaging to different people back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with DNA, that's when I actually
started selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys had a long run together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some great, great genetics came
about your collaborations with DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys won a ton of cups, you know,
and it was like it was pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I always I mean, those guys like
share a really warm spot in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my brothers right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll never forget, you know,
all of the things that they helped me get
[SPEAKER_00]: through, especially in Amsterdam and
getting the seed company going and
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing me to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've I've been fortunate enough to
get full control of my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back and beyond, you know, just Crockett
and go like my own directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really like stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really having some fun, you know,
because it only happened about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we've been I've been with DNA
for so long that we were doing projects
[SPEAKER_00]: together and I was working more towards
all of that stuff and really not focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on Crockett very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the focus is all on on on our farm
and what we can do and doing things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we really enjoy doing and bringing back
things that that maybe people would enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had forgotten about that we
still have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just getting together with people that
I normally wouldn't work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, whatever I was doing,
I was too busy or this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's been it's been a good
ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some great genetics that came
out of all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And strawberry banana being like the first
washer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's been washers throughout
history, but like as far as that was one
[SPEAKER_02]: that really changed the game, I think,
to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we made that in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was me and a friend of mine,
Craig, in one of our our first endeavors
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went to Amsterdam together and
bought a bunch of seeds and ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some of Simon's bubble gum was one
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came home and we started making
some seeds and we crossed it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, this beautiful plant
came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we only made a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only a few seeds to be made like
out of that that little project,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they never really got released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the original cut, you know,
I I coveted for a few probably a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade almost until I gave it to Don and
Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started producing it in
Amsterdam and made a few runs with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in film form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just never really been released
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been something I just bred
with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and yeah, it dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's one of the first real hash
plants that I had created that really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really dumped like everybody like the size
of the heads, the the the easily
[SPEAKER_00]: collectible resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has that gritty feel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost pick up a head with your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's a it's an incredible
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I got two joints of it right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we should probably fire one of those
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk about you for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got raised in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it was never really a secret,
you know, growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't necessarily involved much on it
because I was, you know, under age and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was digging holes and and carrying
soil in and bamboo stakes and and that
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of aspect for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, let me like he said,
yeah, I earned my spot in the trim room
[SPEAKER_04]: and learned how to trim and whatnot
through a season.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that was like a whole experience
like dealing with, you know, all of his
[SPEAKER_04]: friends that were like cultured and
everybody knew what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was kind of new to the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and really cool, cool experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But eventually I started growing on my
own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and obviously he was like right there
beside me, teaching me like, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: do this, do this, you know, get your spot
ready now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now's the time to plant, you know,
like setting me up for just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: success.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and as soon as I was of age,
I started working right under his wing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, working on designing,
you know, grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we built out loud pack and a bunch of
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was involved in all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started getting like this more broad
view on the cannabis industry instead of
[SPEAKER_04]: just like my high school experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was, you know, growing and
cultivating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was included on like breeding
projects and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the same time, I'm still going to
school, college and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I'm also applying the stuff I'm
learning in my home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hold a horticultural class and my
business classes and and working with like
[SPEAKER_04]: the legal stuff and, you know,
the stuff that like my friends had no idea
[SPEAKER_04]: they knew about the hype strains and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're like, yeah, I grew a plant in
my backyard and, you know, whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how much it cost to trim it and
get it processed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, all the stuff behind
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, no, I just grow to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it becomes a business, you start
analyzing all those little details and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time and energy and everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you're trying to make money
off it, you're like, OK, this is my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, every summer and spring,
this is what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each year we get closer and closer to
being tomato farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will be at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like but it's a passion
driven thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see, you know, the last 20 years,
there's been a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: financially motivated and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like now there's a lot of the people
that are sticking with it or people that
[SPEAKER_02]: love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that you know, I love talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys love talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's a great thing when you can
do what you love and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: be passionate about it and be able to take
home a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's super passionate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like totally carried it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, you know, as a kid growing up,
you're like the ideal job would to be
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow make money doing this for the rest
of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he like started this company and all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was included on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty friggin cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, still grateful to be a part
of it and running with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he said, we have the full control of
the company again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like not we're not answering any
corporate anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just what do we want to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do we want to work with?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, you know, some.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were you able to go to any of the cups
back in the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been kind of in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I guess the first cups in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: were 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you go to any of the European
ones?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first the first cup that I went to
was in Denver in 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Milo with his big boots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace, Milo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was a good experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like the transition phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From where it was before to kind of where
it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those years were those years were
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the most fun and special
times I'd ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were when you guys were crushing
the cups, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were every every event.
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA and Crockett's getting called up for
like literally every event.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a handful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it was like they got called
up over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won a lot of awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Tangi had its peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when the Tangi was peaking and,
you know, it was tough to compete with
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangi at that time because Tangi was such
a specific thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk about hypeweed, like gelatos
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangi was that at its time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were a judge and you like DNA
and you like Tangi, everybody knows what
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangi is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other stuff, there's subtleties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tangi is like, oh, yeah, it's like
there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like someone else couldn't enter it
and call it something else because it
[SPEAKER_02]: would get disqualified, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the early days, you know,
it was the early days of BHO, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it started really hitting with
Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wanted Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these these hacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cashmakers and these guys were all
making Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and most of the time with the Shatter,
there was no flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't very terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like Tangi was one of those
varieties that the Terps came through on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an easy way when judges were
picking out the like nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, that was a great run and a
great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those those were great days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and yeah, Brian helped me through
almost all of the shows in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: like almost every single one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys go to the first one 2010 in
San Francisco?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's where I met.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is where we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either that or in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one in 2010 is where I showed Aaron
and and our other buddy, Sergio,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tangi for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the one in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed it to him for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's when they they loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I actually came and brought him a
cut of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took off from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were like O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: gas guys, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the funny thing is these O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: gas guys are like Tangi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that became a big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I like gas, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so let's go into the Tangi a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear the backstory on the
Tangi, because well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had been messing with Calio for the
longest time and 14 week Calio or 14 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was more of like October 10th
Calio.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it was the the shorter
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the guys indoor in the Bay,
it was like 14 to 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend, Sean Alberts, that that
grew it at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, with that,
it yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours isn't that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's more of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's doable.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 to 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that and I was I was
messing around with a lot of skunks like
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet skunk, citrus skunk and all these
different skunks back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this really great skunk that
was was was just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we had bread with it with our
Calio because the Calio that we have is
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been making seeds from it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not pure Calio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the Calio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's it's our kind of your Calio
Calio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, back in the day, there
weren't the names weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't the importance played on
names as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this other citrus skunk and we the
cross just made this beautiful aroma of
[SPEAKER_00]: like pure oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ranges to like if you planted 20
female tangies, you'll get an array of the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and the potency and all of that
will be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the terpene profile itself will differ
from like an orange peel to an orange
[SPEAKER_00]: juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rindy peel with the fresh squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that fresh squeeze kind of almost
orange blossom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've smoked a bunch of different
tangies over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple tangy, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a blood, blood orange tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purple tangy was off of the
original tangy stock that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to OG Steve.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I have this thing about like with
phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm sharing weed with my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like typically I prefer the if I'm asking
for feedback, I prefer giving a joint a
[SPEAKER_02]: big joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't get to look at the weed
because we know what good weed looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what good color looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know all about the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I'm more concerned about the
flavor and the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you give everybody joints,
you get the same kind of response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like more than likely people
are going to smoke those joints because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're easy to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor on this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower, it's not super eye appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as far as like bag appeal,
typically compared to some of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I guess depending on what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you put it in a joint,
it smokes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it in hash, it smokes some of the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and the there's a few different
varieties of strawberry banana out there
[SPEAKER_00]: because they come from the different
seeds, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so the the one that was from the
original clone there is is pretty eye
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the aesthetics on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just frosted where you can just hit
it and just it just rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buds get a little bit bigger,
but it is a little leafier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's that's what helps it
like get such a big yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On, you know, hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys also have a farm, too,
for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have vegetables or promoting them
online at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've seen something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is not you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should totally collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a farm in Texas that is called
Crockett Family Farms, and it's from
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett, Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and they they they sell
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Crockett Family Farms,
Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, so breeding focus, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your focus right now on breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: The you guys you guys do in large scale
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do in a lot of outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like three basic focuses,
you know, seed production for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC seed production for hemp and then,
you know, seed production for or or just
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for THC for our packs and for the
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we we run three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of our three resources right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like depending on what you're looking
for, if you're looking to to get something
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and you want to plant 10 acres or
20 acres, 20 acres of something and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need it to be done by a certain day,
you know, we can help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, with autos and different things
like that on the larger scale stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fun stuff is the stuff that goes
on just in our on our farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is the indoor and all the
hunting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Popping your 30 year old seeds and hoping
for one to pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a embryo rescue now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it's just pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the game of operation almost on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pop it off with a pair of
tweezers like you pop the shell,
[SPEAKER_02]: the coat of the seed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pop that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you actually take the embryo out
and put it in something that's more
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for it to be able to recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you can actually just take
it out and put it in agar and grow it and
[SPEAKER_02]: like with hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, 30, 40, 50 year old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they've popped seeds that are
thousands years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's possible, anything's
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, our focus like right now is
making new varieties, testing the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that we've already made.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into the other spaces of of other
states for our products to be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: available, you know, trying to expand a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still doing the European thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys just focused on the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have full distribution almost
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're focusing more on just,
you know, testing out the stuff that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a test that you mentioned Milo
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he came and he came to the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 2018 and came to my
house in the state of my house for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought a bunch of seeds from
cheese and blue cheese and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of his original stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we when after he passed,
I was like, man, I'm going to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never planted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just always just had them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm going to plant these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted all those seeds and we just,
you know, we're we're actually kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: going through them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've we picked a cheese winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked a blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never really had like a true
experience with cheese like like offensive
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese or it's almost borderline
offensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was like growing up, me and my
friends, we thought we knew what cheese
[SPEAKER_04]: was.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bought weed cheese or cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we started growing some of these
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, I had no idea what
cheese was super loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like somewhere sweeter and all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I thought I was supposed to
smell like cheese or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like that's what I was
expecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hasn't been that so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we haven't smoked any of these
varieties yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't like got there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of popping seeds and
then having to wait so long before you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually get to try to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's a big letdown and other
times stuff that like looks a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes so much changes from the time
you harvest it even where you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it looks all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go to smoke it and it's like
the most amazing smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one that looks so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That yielded so much is just kind of a big
letdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole process is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go into any events right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of just planning on spannibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's going to be the next
big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't have any big plans
except for spannibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You going to spannibus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to spannibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be at spannibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be at the greenhouse booth again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was usually for the last few
years, I'd been doing the big booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with other seed companies and then
Arian was like, come down and you could
[SPEAKER_02]: get into our space and hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, cool, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were over right by Don and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't you did go last year.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see me over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like right next to DNA too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you had a booth at spannibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were kind of in the center and
right across from you was another booth
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mark bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had about 100 curling irons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how the curling iron is evolved
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have one in my pocket rosin
carts we have today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we got these rosin carts and it
started with the curling iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jason, midnight writer, Jason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the curling iron guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing a lot of curling iron action.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and Ashley were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a he's a gadget guy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like the coolest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can always figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He he took this old mail Jeep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is off topic and turned it
into a where it burned hydrogen and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was getting like 90 miles to the
gallon on this like old mail Jeep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, does stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a guy who can like figure stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows some killer weed, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He introduced us to the loud berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I was like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the fruitiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he hunted that out of so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The library was Fina hunted out of we had
done so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he got a 10 pack, popped them and
then found the library.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, literally, there was so many
there's probably 1500 seeds that had gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through different people's hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For him to get that one out of a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's also proof that you have to
be able to grow really good weed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to feed on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the thing is, I think a lot of
then there was a lot of good females,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like really the best expressions,
they stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to be able to grow to a
certain level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't, then a lot of your stuff
just looks the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to miss a lot of the good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to bring it to its fullest
potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then there's like the drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the curing and all those things are
super good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't do those right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where usually people ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruin it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: After all this, they ruin it in a week's
period or two weeks by drying it too fast
[SPEAKER_02]: or drying it too slow or, you know,
having the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it's just an environmental thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're screwing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there is a lot of well,
and it's also there's an art to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people can follow
recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can follow a recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like it's when there's an art to
it that that separates people for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because there's a lot of stuff you
can't read about, it's like we because the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds different sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, do I pull it out of the room
today or do I wait another day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you just follow the recipe,
it doesn't always work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to just kind of eyeball things
and touch and feel and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of always bend to the snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just little things that totally,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the candle brush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys seen that now?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: That little nylon looks like a baster for
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like a meat baster.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I thought it was kind of a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was like, you've got to be kidding
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of my buddies, he crushes it
with it and they do like four to five
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds a day metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's like four to five pounds
of trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he also grows really big buds and
keeps the environmentals perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because, you know, just because
it doesn't work for somebody doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_02]: it won't work for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was totally blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is like a lot of the top
shelf guys, because if you do it right,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually touching the bud less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have your temperature and
humidity set to where the trichomes are
[SPEAKER_02]: pliable, but they're not going to snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then when you brush, you're not
fucking up the trichomes and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting all the butt off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to have chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do it with larv.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's strange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've used one a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they've had them at Pacific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, this kind of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally wasn't sold out in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you got to be kidding me that
people are coming out with different stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like seeing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw something cool you guys would like
the under canopy lights green for
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses and for indoor, whatever,
like, I feel like it's just another thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're talking about 25 percent yield
increases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really get like where you either
have mixed light or greenhouse and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: put under canopy light and get all the
stuff that does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't really fill out to harden up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there is that light to it goes
around a pot like so it's like a beta
[SPEAKER_04]: product, I think, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's supposed to go around a specific
size pot and your plant like is growing up
[SPEAKER_04]: through it and it shines up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like some UV that's supposed to
like sterilize everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You run it like 60 seconds or something in
the night or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So see if it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've heard like good things about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everyone's like, I don't know how far
you're supposed to be away from it when it
[SPEAKER_04]: turns on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I'm using it in a tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, OK, is the tent really
blocking these like rays right here going
[SPEAKER_04]: through?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I think when I leave the
building and like that, I'll let it turn
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're the microwaves, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it says it kills DNA on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, oh, yeah, that's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it to Don and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back into some breeding talk
about like separating males like you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a lot of male breeding,
also feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But regular breeding with true males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you keep them alive in clone form for a
long time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how do you guys do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do keep specific males alive in clone
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some that we have that are very
difficult to do that because they turn to
[SPEAKER_00]: like flower a lot more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even as soon as they like touch the pot
and like their roots start bounding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you have them on 24.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 and they'll flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to keep cloning them after
the autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a few of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it kind of a pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do check quite often to make sure
nothing's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we keep our males in clone form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were constantly looking and constantly
checking and using different males and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing side by side males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can turn a male as well back.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll sometimes we'll do that and
just see how much resident we can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: produce on these males and get a smell
from them and kind of pick out our males
[SPEAKER_00]: in different ways like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just and obviously with structure and
just you know, a stem rub and looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you got to have some sort of.
[SPEAKER_02]: After 40 years, you figure you'd pick up a
couple of tips along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the real one is growing the
next generation out and seeing how well
[SPEAKER_02]: you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are definitely identifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, stem rub, but also tricone
production on the male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely how they they're structured to,
like if they're long and short,
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to their female counterparts,
siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we do a lot of different things
with with, you know, just the selection
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were we've been doing even lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just using it in different ways to
taking our taking our males like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a specific variety, male and
female, and going both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, reciprocal, you know,
reciprocal, doing reciprocal greeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I find my most success when
I'm looking for to to find something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I can kind of make that
happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's more predictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you could be missing out on a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, depending on if the
traits from the father or the mother,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you totally could miss out on
some of the best stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and until you know your lines really
well, those are the kind of things you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even still, it's always interesting
seeing the results, but also space and
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So time is the one thing we don't have
enough of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And space is a close second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do you see the future of the
industry going?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think you have your your foot
in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you guys going to go into other
products to try to predict it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's definitely difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's there's no I couldn't have
predicted it 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it was it's definitely
going in a in a in a bigger, more
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but at the same time,
a lot of these people that kind of jumped
[SPEAKER_00]: into it and had all this this big money
kind of dropped out or are dropping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smaller, the smaller, more,
you know, boutique, the more the more
[SPEAKER_00]: heady weed, the better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quality is coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all about purple, even though
purple has its place or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like it all has its place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's also so subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think good flour is not always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty obvious, you know,
like good and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the commercial stuff boutique
would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see farm to table or like
these these microbrewery type models pop
[SPEAKER_02]: up all over California to where you can go
to the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can buy flour at the farm of the
stuff that you see growing where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to the farmer and he can tell you all
the things he's put into that plant over
[SPEAKER_02]: generations or how he bred it to get it to
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's part of like a bigger
experience that like we're missing a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can do with wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with almost anything,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once I schedule three, that's pretty
wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole scheduling when they could just
de-schedule it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, and I think we've been taking
steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still going in the right direction
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I'm seeing, you know, a lot of the
weeding out of of of a lot of the boof and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the the meds, even like the stuff
that's coming around on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the traditional market and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the quality is rising in a lot of
things and the prices are going up in
[SPEAKER_00]: different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, those are good signs,
good signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, I mean, I think the last
couple of years have been rough and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more seed companies now than ever
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like there's new ones coming out
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and those seeds a fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you make one round of seeds,
your seed company is good for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it's it's you know,
it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a new seed company every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just people, not even seed companies,
just people that are have online presence
[SPEAKER_00]: in some sort of social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something that that are doing something
that people find interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's people that aren't even
seed companies that are just growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent and were really successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like they they put their whole
story on there of how they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some seeds and they make seeds and
then people want to buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the hype around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like just because you have
access to good genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to I'm happy people are
working with the plant if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: producing good quality genetics,
that's even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're smoking good flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, content is I mean, it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're also going to see a big
comeback with a lot of the genetics we
[SPEAKER_02]: liked when we were younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think even getting land race,
obviously the land race stuff has kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: been a hot topic lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like we're just going to keep
going in that direction because we need
[SPEAKER_02]: more diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like the top 40s list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what's popular today isn't going
to be popular tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, when we were younger,
you know, probably the same for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm older than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm 46.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little older than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, back in the day, you know,
when we were younger, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were looking at these these varieties
that were that were out of our reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were our parents stuff or whatever
things that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the yesteryear stuff,
Al Capoco gold or this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, you know, now, you know,
people are looking back on the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they're curious about these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen like Northern Lights,
five haze and all this Shishkeberry and
[SPEAKER_02]: all these northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NL five hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of different for Collins
Coff is one of them, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many all of these things,
you know, that I was taking like like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bus up to like Vancouver in 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to like buy these on like Hastings
Street from like Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a respectable joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a funny story about Mark Emery,
but I love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's we were traveling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took for I think it was back then it
was forty nine bucks for a round trip
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket anywhere that Greyhound went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got on this bus and we went all the
way up to Vancouver, B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we found this place called the
respectable joint where it's cool to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but they didn't sell weed in there,
but you could smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were in there and we were like
smoking weed and talking and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and my buddy turned around and
there was like nobody in the store,
[SPEAKER_00]: like even the counter person and people
selling coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was out of the store and we were
like the only ones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we seen out the front door,
you know, somebody like like giving a
[SPEAKER_00]: speech in front of a bunch of cameras and
all this stuff and like the the local
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we walked out the door and it's Mark
Emery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and my buddy just flanked him with
our Grateful Dead fricking tie dye shirts
[SPEAKER_00]: on like standing on each side of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like in front of all the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were on the news that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up meeting people over there
and we'd always buy seeds over there and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think it was like it was like
Northern Lights, number five, Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica, Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, Blueberry, Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five times everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was the Northern Lights to
like the Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was that's what they would
call it up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I ever saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just all the stuff that we
would get up there, all these grapefruits
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the island sweet skunk and Romulan and
the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, Jake from Romulan Genetics is
coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Romulan is a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was popular in the Bay Area for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew my share of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would get you really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still some of your buddies growing
that and that Romulan and that island
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet skunk cut they still got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we grew we grew a lot of
that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a that was a huge plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow like a 15 foot plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just terpy and had a lot of limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cerebral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, head sweats, paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it brought the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think somebody says, oh,
Sativa's don't really hit you very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have them smoke a joint of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go drive around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've never been to Europe, I don't
think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those hazes in Europe are just so
strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's yeah, I really like I like
haze also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like European haze, but sometimes I
don't like where it's like, I don't do
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs of those either, because they're so
strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those European ones are just it's
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get you there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a couple of hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That original haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess Hayes Brothers Hayes,
those guys made Blue Dream as well,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes Brothers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the I mean, there's been so many
like even that we were talking about Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, that Ranger, that's yeah,
that's like a Mexican haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a a just a mage page of that
thing is legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the cut around still?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the only thing we have is seed form of
hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but that is a a really, really unique
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, is it doesn't really look like
much like it's very leafy, but it's super
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost has that Oregon blueberry looked
where it has that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really like frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like blueish purple, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but it's long flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's like a pain in the ass plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects on that are probably some of
the my favorite that I've found in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Ranger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's funny because Hayes can go in a
lot of different directions with effect
[SPEAKER_02]: because and even within African,
if you go Durban versus Congo,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Durban kicks your ass and then you got
the Congo and it makes you super happy and
[SPEAKER_02]: laugh like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like those are regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not that far apart in the sense,
you know, that they're on the same
[SPEAKER_02]: continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, completely different effects
and flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get that anise licorice with
the with the Durban, which I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anything black licorice or anise is
like totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if it's like coating like that
menthol, almost like a menthol coat with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys working with Landry stuff,
bringing them back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have like Pakistan's that black African
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got black.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there's there's a tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pakistan and the the the African
Hayes, those are the two that really stood
[SPEAKER_04]: out, like honestly, like different than
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you had some pounds of that and
you went around and tried to like you
[SPEAKER_04]: showed some people, they'd be like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've never even seen this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't even look like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very leaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, the Pakistan had a decent
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still kind of airy and but it has
like that food smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like this crazy resin on it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was small, but it would like turn to
sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was it was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the African Hayes was giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resin on that was like like
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're very thin and it was a lot of
leaf around them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking to grow something
different, those are great options,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially because we're growing stuff
that's so similar a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why the freak show became
and also like freak show doesn't put out a
[SPEAKER_02]: ton of leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a low leaf to flower ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they got a purple freak show,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got two different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding things into some of those land race
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the some of the stuff's
one step away, you know, like five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Oreos.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's a good it's once a
purple punch and Oreos are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't bag on strains usually
on my show at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I feel like they're good and
they're one step away from being great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mike from Exotic did a lot with
the purple punch that made it great,
[SPEAKER_02]: made it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red runs was like the best expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you're when you're when
you're looking for stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to look at, you know,
the purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what you want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But growing the growing wise, I mean,
it's it's it looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it puts off a lot of resin and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know, if you have something
that's dominating with flavor and smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and you put that to it, you know,
hopefully it'll retain its flavored smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and not tamed too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take advantage of that
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem with Oreos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem with Oreos is it has like these
chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_02]: The turps are really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it doesn't smoke like you like
it to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effects are OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effects are fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like as far as like flavor,
it's it has something that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: compete with stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's so frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like more of those
crosses you get a couple of generations
[SPEAKER_02]: away where it has the turps of something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll do it as potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've done that a lot of times in
the past with different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like there was a blackberry
that blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a tested like eight percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the darkest, but it was super black
and it looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you had to take it so covered,
though, and hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it would like flower in the
bedroom out, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be like, you'd have to thin it out
because they just start flowering a few
[SPEAKER_00]: steps away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you're talking, you know,
and like it's like these different things
[SPEAKER_04]: that like it was a cool plant for breeding
purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially you can lock in that that color
pretty easily, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I remember I did not get you
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because green crack was one
where it would like get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then after you had a tolerance,
your tolerance would kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would you could smoke a whole
joint of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could smoke a pound a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't be high at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I love green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get like one ounce a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the first couple of days,
the first day with it is gay because it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets you super lit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you have a high tolerance,
your friends come over and you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, you got to try this and you don't
really prep them for it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be on the couch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we still have a good green crack cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an excellent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually washes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty wild because I feel like
there are genetics in pockets,
[SPEAKER_02]: certain things like green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking for a green crack for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, and then I just bumped into
the cat piss guy, my cat piss buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's somebody who actually grew the
cat piss back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can get his feedback on the cat piss
that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, cause there's cat piss is an
aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's this huge war going on of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I created the cat piss or I was given
the cat piss and I'm Vallejo and you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't create the cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the SoCal cat piss and
the NorCal cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have named it something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's like, it's a description of
an aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, it's a funny thing because cat
piss was the best thing growing up and it
[SPEAKER_02]: looked the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say it's very, very old,
you know, cause people were calling it cat
[SPEAKER_00]: piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in nineties is when I saw it the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I heard some hippie at a Grateful
Dead show or not Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dead in company.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was saying, no, no, I'm pretty sure
they had cat piss back in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had stuff they called cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it probably wasn't the same thing,
but like it makes sense because cat piss
[SPEAKER_02]: is the description of a smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like blue dream where it's a very
specific name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to, to bring you up that green
crack and a few other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a list of some stuff that I
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to trade some genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got some cool stuff too,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got some really cool autos I'm
working with right now that are got full
[SPEAKER_02]: color expression, gelato, taste,
you know, it's been, and it's been a while
[SPEAKER_02]: coming, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then using some genetics to get,
reinforce the color because I thought I
[SPEAKER_02]: could do it on my own and never could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then got some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandalorian full, full duplex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gnome, gnome, gnome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing really interesting stuff
color wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that black strap actually breeds
pretty true to the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So incorporating that in through a couple
of generations, you can get good color.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys do auto breeding too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually brought you some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some black Cuban haze and some PIF.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were smoking some PIF out there in New
York a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like everybody's got PIF and sour
right now, especially with how,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like, everybody's growing and it's
around every corner and everybody's got
[SPEAKER_04]: PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's got sour, but nobody has the
real sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy's coming a little bit later
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got real sour and I love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always loved sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I hadn't realized how much I'd
missed, even though I missed it a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't realized how much I'd missed it
until I actually saw it again for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time in like, I don't know,
five or six years where it was like the
[SPEAKER_02]: real deal, where it's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open the bag and you get hit with like
that, like the burn of, it smells like
[SPEAKER_02]: burnt tires, burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, it smells like... It might
burn your eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's offensive a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you squeeze the buds and it's got
like the lime and the pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because like over the years
you like, as you've moved further away
[SPEAKER_02]: from stuff, you don't completely forget
what it smells like because you smell it
[SPEAKER_02]: again and you're like, I know that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you forget how amazing stuff is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always loved sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the funny thing is like this stuff
tests probably like 14 or 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it gets you ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we all know that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had an LA Con that would test it
like 18%.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA Con was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just floor me every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was right when everybody started
really testing a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, this is low,
you know, and some of this other stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: higher, but the effect on me, it wasn't as
strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Nugs, LA Con.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had orange hairs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had nice orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short and stout.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long veg, but definitely worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smoked really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was joint weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would wreck your day if you weren't
ready for it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss a lot of those OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's going to make a
comeback to like the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these things are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to make comebacks in their
own way with crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like the nostalgic stuff that
we grew up with and where if people can
[SPEAKER_02]: find it either in seed form or a clone,
getting bred back into this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of people have a lot of OG
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG is one of those other things that it's
like when you cross it, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily get an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of recessive traits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having an OG that actually shows an
OG traits, you know, the shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds, the smells, the, you know,
everything that's not just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hybrid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are kind of hard to find
right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you did some good OG seeds a while
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's so funny because I
think you did the kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we said we called kosher OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the version of the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a sour kosher and Hell's Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there wasn't a lot of straight OG
seeds forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they tried to do them over in
Europe and they put it with White Widow
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, you know, or Critical or
whatever they were using to breed it with
[SPEAKER_02]: for their donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they completely ruined it because like
those recessive traits are difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: breed back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have something so dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that's so like OG takes on,
you know, flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just how White Widow does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to keep that OG like funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it always turns into more gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, it's like there's a
difference between like the gas and the
[SPEAKER_00]: funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess OG is gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like it's got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that tiny earthy basement funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that earthy like pine where you get
the, it almost smells like fresh pine
[SPEAKER_02]: needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, I mean, that's the one when you
grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's one thing the guys growing
to indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the outdoor, like those are the
outdoor, those are the years I remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with the sours that was outdoor,
the OGs that were outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a bunch of outdoor and it's
just, those were better for smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're a smoker for flavor,
I felt like those back in the day were
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the sour stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you smoke those to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it tasted good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was only a handful of stuff
that I was able to get when I was younger
[SPEAKER_02]: that would, you'd smoke it to the roach
and it would be absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the outdoor, a lot of that stuff
didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been, I love sours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in the garden right now, we have a
bunch of headbands and sours and Kims and
[SPEAKER_04]: I-95s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love headbands.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a headband that we've had for a
long time and OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got all the old blue G's still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because the gassy from like
nine, the chem dog and the gassy from the
[SPEAKER_02]: OG are two different kind of gases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got that burnt rubber latex-y like
super pungent and then OG is super pungent
[SPEAKER_02]: as well and super loud, but it's like
gassy, like rocket fuel kind of gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like gasoline rather than burnt tire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I love both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has that nice earth to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the ghost or?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, OG is OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I like about OG the most is just
the effect on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find weed that will hit you
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, make your eyes all low.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this one though.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like Tropicana orange juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's blood orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the blood orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's got that Tropicana orange juice
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's tangy for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's funny because this is really on
the blossom side, like the fresh squeezed
[SPEAKER_02]: juice and not the rindy side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do like the rind too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the rind is especially extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that rind is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say I like the sweet bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The orange sickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange sickle like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so you guys seen Agent Orange?
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy rest in peace like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's so much of his stuff
to like get a lot of turps in his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chernobyl Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had the there's like the
Chernobyl and then there was the golden
[SPEAKER_02]: ticket cut of the Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't it wasn't the Slimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Slimer or the golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew both of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had like all kinds of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Agent Orange was really so I didn't
like the Agent Orange until I saw it
[SPEAKER_02]: growing at House of Cultivar in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was bunk because I in the
early 2000s, there was Calio that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: exposed to and then Tangy and then Agent
Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Agent Orange and I'm like,
wow, this stuff that I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was very linear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like just an orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost like orange color and no
complexity at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not color, but orange smell that was
very linear.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no complexity at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went to House of Cultivar in
2018 and he had stuff labeled Agent
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, no, dude, this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, OK, so I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, this is an Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Tangy, but it was just another
Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first I was like, well,
maybe it's Tangy because it's smelled more
[SPEAKER_02]: like Tangy than Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was different than Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you just never know when you get
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone might get that one winner,
Loudberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the turps on the Agent Orange,
I've grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the ones that I had, they were more
orange peel and orange rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was orange turps to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I thought had amazing turps from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub Cool was Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jilly Bean was good, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jill's taking credit for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that had great turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they had great turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think with all their stuff,
it almost all had flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had like the Green Avengers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they had like literally they had
some of the best guys working for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good friends with a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, between Pat Heroes
from the farm, they had Shane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonny Chiba, Odie was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was quite agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good old days, the good old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were fun events, though,
like the old old events.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you know, it's hard to
describe and even put it into words,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's kind of how disco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once disco was done, it was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still try to do disco now,
but it's not what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Cubs were kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a big family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we had the most amazing times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was like the same people would go
to all the events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were like a big family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like going and seeing your
friends again, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to a cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, kind of who to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's probably like 250 of us that
all kind of went and were all
[SPEAKER_02]: intermingled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was like 100 that were pretty
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody kind of knew everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and we were all there for for
weed because we like we like flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we like the cannabis, which I think
it's an amazing thing that it can bring
[SPEAKER_02]: all of us together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when it was like in Amsterdam
and stuff and everybody would jam there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From all over the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Around Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have Thanksgiving at that one
hotel that that served an American
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like 100, 200 of us every time.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adventures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spannabis is another one like Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that's my favorite event that goes on
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see my friends there every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great seeing people that I've
been friends with on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's such good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's very social.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't do social stuff like I used
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do it like once or twice a
month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, oh, maybe like twice a
year, three times a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to really break loose as we're
getting older.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I couldn't do it twice a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there was a lot of work back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, showing up to all
these different places and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything all like ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we had we had that was a
whole crew of fly people in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it was a it was a whole
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like if you did booths,
it's like setting up the booth and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: there early, getting up early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then while the event's going,
you show up before everybody gets there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you stay till later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I saw people closing down early
quite a bit, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, I mean, it was we were
hustling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were everybody was working really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you had long lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it was like the whole day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just at one point we were like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'd have like five employees like
just lined up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody sounds like it's the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added up how many packs of seeds that we
had sold and how many minutes they were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the time that we were open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was more than like two or three
packs a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy that that was the heat of our
was at Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it didn't last the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we ran out in like four or five
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like those are the best of
when you can sell out at shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and especially if you're going
anywhere destination, if you sell out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have to go home with seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we've been we're looking forward
to after an Amsterdam to Spain and and go
[SPEAKER_00]: up there and see everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I had a great time last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Post-COVID, that was it was unexpected
because the first year that they did it
[SPEAKER_02]: after COVID, it was pretty dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then last year was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like it was like people I hadn't
seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them I hadn't seen in 10 years or,
you know, it seemed like everybody came
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good show.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was more people than ever
any spandibus on that last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty packed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came home healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first time I brought the BA three
back, like the COVID BA three,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the carriers of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tested before I got on the airplane,
came back, started feeling funky,
[SPEAKER_02]: took a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife was sick within a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was kind of rough, but
interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost went out there that year,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually canceled our flights and
everything because we were headed out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's crazy.
