Music
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today our special guests are Jack and
Lance from Grove.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thank you guys for coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lance, this is your second time on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jack, this is your first time on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to smoke some loud.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you are the co-founder of Grove
and you guys make the most amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: turplock bags that, you know, I used,
I found out about turplocks from Lance
[SPEAKER_02]: originally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, it feels like just
another Mylar bag, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then Lance is like, no, no,
no, this is not just another Mylar bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to test things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to test things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big part of what I do is I do a lot
of testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at the facility, at the house,
I'm always testing, A-B testing one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: against the other, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I basically took a turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a glass jar and I took a turplock
and I put them on the shelf and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: basically evaluated them from week to
week, month to month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lance was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an amazing bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you guys sold me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we got a James Loud turplock bag,
the second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2.0 man, we dropped the first one on
this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was fitting, especially
bringing the man himself, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to debut it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I love about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like me, you love testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stick with stuff that you enjoy and
you love, but you're always open to trying
[SPEAKER_01]: new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same way, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both grew up in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both have that mentality of like the
wives tales with the glass jars and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was in the same position you were
when I discovered this years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, just try it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the proof's in the pudding,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: The proof is in the pudding and you can't
refute the data, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, you can look four
months down the road and you can tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between the stuff that's in the
turkey bag and the mason jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been a mason jar guy my whole
life and I don't use mason jars anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm waiting for you guys to come
out with the mason jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the turplock mason jar, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys make a great product and it's
easy to use, it's easy to store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just another Mylar bag like a
lot of people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to get down to where this all
started with you and how you got started
[SPEAKER_02]: with the concept with the turplock and
everything else with Grove.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, you got to kind of go back to kind
of my relationship with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what kind of got me interested and
gave me ideas and got me curious about the
[SPEAKER_05]: plan, the plan science.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my older brother, Charlie, has pretty
severe cerebral palsy and moved out to
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually the first person who was
totally disabled to graduate from UCLA law
[SPEAKER_05]: school.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's his claim to fame.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, he got all the brains in the
family.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was out here and he got a
tremendous amount of relief from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So seeing the California medical program,
you know, when he was home, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: growing for him, you know, producing a
growing flower for him before he was in
[SPEAKER_05]: California full time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Learning about flower, you know,
is expensive to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your parents house was a totally different
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, your family would lose
everything if they found a grow in your
[SPEAKER_05]: house that, you know, your parents careers
over, you know, bank drop them at
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was tough and it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when lost some flower due to,
you know, not burping it properly,
[SPEAKER_05]: which, you know, I really came to
understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll dive into, you know,
that whole mission or what burping or
[SPEAKER_05]: burping is anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a flower that just would go bad and
kind of difficult with the post-harvest
[SPEAKER_05]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of stuff that I found deep
online was really conflicting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a lot of conflicting,
you know, uncohesive opinions about
[SPEAKER_05]: qualitative seniors without really any
quantitative benchmarks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, fast forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, oh, man, like, I can't wait
to go to, you know, the dispensary in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like these guys is going to this is going
to be the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like I go to the space and I'm like,
all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a pretty nice flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, go and pop the pop top open
the next day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And something we didn't know at the time
was like those trans lose about one
[SPEAKER_05]: percent of internal relative unity for
every, you know, hour they're exposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: an environment that bad of barrier
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, pop this pop up open.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was it was harsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unpleasant to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terpene profiles were gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medicinal value is gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, there's still still this
problem on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, even though we're at this point,
like maybe maybe there's there's something
[SPEAKER_05]: to really do and add value here because
looking ahead is like, all right,
[SPEAKER_05]: this industry is going to be competitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cannabis is not always going to
be six thousand dollars a pound in the
[SPEAKER_05]: state.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are going to jump in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a different market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really need a professional standard of
way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: This industry is going to, you know,
mature rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quality standards are going to go up
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Competitive, you know, the competitive
environment is going to intensify rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The need for operational superiority and
operational excellence is going to come
[SPEAKER_05]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we were always confident
that when we launched Turplock as a
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, we had been through a lot of
different iterations to develop the the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the material or Turplock V1 and
then kind of had to let the markets catch
[SPEAKER_05]: up to that a little bit more still,
not that we didn't need to grow into the
[SPEAKER_05]: market and grow into the business and
continue to do a lot of research and
[SPEAKER_05]: development and deepening our
understanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, cannabis was selling so fast and
regulated markets that no one no one had
[SPEAKER_05]: any concern for a post-harvest process.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you looked at someone and told them
that there was actually an intense
[SPEAKER_05]: difference between drying and carrying,
they'd look at you and their eyes would
[SPEAKER_05]: glaze over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, obviously, you know, we're in a very
different environment today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I still love a fresh
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think fresh products are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain genetics, you know, I think they
they're the best fresh and then other
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars seem to be better once they're
cured longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think you have to define fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, so defining fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does fresh mean in cannabis?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fresh and cannabis means something that
has, you know, prominent sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, to me, I expect that's
a lot of, you know, this this broad
[SPEAKER_05]: misleading definition or term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Freshness was really a black hole because
I think Z and candy is a great,
[SPEAKER_05]: great example of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everybody says they're sick of
Z, but most of our fridges are still full
[SPEAKER_05]: of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, that point aside,
most of us are pulling down Z,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a seven, eight, nine,
ten days early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are we doing that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because those fragile profiles of
sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we're talking freshness is because
sesquiterpenes in most packaging and for
[SPEAKER_05]: most of us in the the industry,
you know, whether you're a prosumer,
[SPEAKER_05]: home grower, you know, a top notch
facility, have a loose standard around
[SPEAKER_05]: their free versus bound water and a life
cycle of product moving through their
[SPEAKER_05]: facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's what's, you know,
plays into our concept of freshness.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we saw that with, you know,
ZO Olympics recently, too, where you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of the people that I think are the a
lot of top of game players in the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, the samples take takes a
while to go through and smoke all the
[SPEAKER_05]: samples of the judge going for two,
three, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a, you know, even top tier
product from top tier professionals if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, you know, for if the competition is
not leveraging the right supply chain
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging technology, not not harnessing
the right life cycle as a piece of the
[SPEAKER_05]: right life cycle product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when it's doing a disservice to what
that cultivator intended to have reviewed
[SPEAKER_05]: in that competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've seen that, you know,
really play out and become a forefront of
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation as you shed time and an
opportunity to really, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: get scientific about about post-harvest
and post-harvest life cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And post-harvest life cycle understanding
that what's that's not just drying and
[SPEAKER_05]: carrying being different between dry and
carrying, but that's drying and person
[SPEAKER_05]: carrying.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the life cycle of the product in my
facility through packaging, sorting,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, pre-rolls, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's also also the life cycle of the
product to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Post-harvest has been overlooked for so
long and it's still being overlooked by a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of communities and a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was just in St. Vincent and I
think there's awareness and there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: people working towards it, but you know,
especially in places, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: California is not as big of a deal with
post-harvest as somewhere like St. Vincent
[SPEAKER_02]: or the Caribbean that is super humid
because the humidity just destroys turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they like our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been down to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a trip, the team out to Thailand
earlier last year, Hawaii for their annual
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point, those high humidity
markets, they really love the technology
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're like, I'm not fighting
this ambient anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, they don't need any active
atmospheric modifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the interesting thing is some
people are using humidity packs or things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last thing you need in those
types of environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need something that creates that
barrier from that outside higher RH
[SPEAKER_01]: because 70, 80, 90% relative humidity is
not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: To your point in those environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a technology that can actually
preserve that flower as it's meant to be
[SPEAKER_01]: consumed by the grower, by you,
by me, by all of us that grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pivotal, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely matters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's, there's a lot of,
a lot of attention being paid to the
[SPEAKER_05]: critical impact of that post-harvest
cycle, particularly on, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: bottom lines of organizations,
I think in, you know, especially with,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, how intensely competitive
California flower market is.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if you're, if you're a grow
that produces, let's say a thousand pounds
[SPEAKER_05]: of wheat of year, that's 454,400 pounds of
flour, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or grams of flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a 3% loss weight from a bad
management of bound versus unbound flour,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's directly translates to 3% of your top
line revenue disparity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, and not only does, you know,
are we talking, are these metrics that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're really trying to talk about and
they'll tie around directly correlate to
[SPEAKER_05]: the top line revenue from a weight
perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually directly correlated to the,
you know, the most valuable and fragile
[SPEAKER_05]: parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these days, I mean, quality is so
important for all brands, but especially
[SPEAKER_02]: the guys, the middle sized companies,
we're not talking about the giants,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the small businesses, quality is
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality comes down to your success,
to your failure in the, in the rec market,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise it's just a race to the bottom
if you're in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could, that could be the
difference of keeping your business alive
[SPEAKER_02]: or your business failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then storage now, because there's this
abundance of product available,
[SPEAKER_02]: your product might not get consumed for
two or three or four months.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you really have to be
concerned with how is it being stored?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been talking, I mean,
you guys were in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I featured your bags in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also the refrigerated model, I think
everything needs to be stored at a colder
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature from the time it leaves your
facility where you've obviously tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: store it and keep it in a controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time the consumer gets it,
you need to control that product as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think you're, you're talking about
dew points and stressors for the flower
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen that play out a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly, you know, frustrations in
different markets, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: Ontario, what work with a, you know,
some really talented folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So out there and Ontario and product
consent and warehouses, very poor climate
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions for months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're talking about there,
when you're bringing flour from,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, very cold environments,
let's say below, below 45 degrees
[SPEAKER_05]: Fahrenheit, super warm environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would define that as above seven
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're doing is you're really
stressing the flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're dramatically increasing the
respiration rate for some of those
[SPEAKER_05]: volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: There is actually really negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same with burping is really negative
because you then have containers and
[SPEAKER_05]: storage conditions that don't allow those
volatile organic compounds a chance to
[SPEAKER_05]: settle and re reattach a stabilized
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're doing any sort of burping or
evacuation or flush or you have leaky
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging or you have packaging with bad
barrier properties or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: bad oxygen transmission rates or moisture
vapor transmission rates that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and it's really not lined up
with this, particularly with the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the water activity level of
flour and it's, you know, unthoughtful
[SPEAKER_05]: storage environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have dramatic qualitative,
you know, damage happening at all of those
[SPEAKER_05]: points.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it kind of comes together,
particularly when you're stressing flour
[SPEAKER_05]: outside those ranges.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really don't have the same product
that you, you submitted anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about burping and what goes
on with burping and why turblocks have
[SPEAKER_02]: such a huge advantage if you're using them
as opposed to the traditional burping
[SPEAKER_02]: methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just finished a study on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just finished a study on that,
which Lance will touch on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it if you gave a little teaser
because we're coming out with that and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're pretty psyched about what we studied
and we worked with on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, one of the things
we've always hoped to do as a business is
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of further the conversation and
curing and storage and post-harvest
[SPEAKER_05]: lifecycle of flour, post-harvest
optimization of flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the burping versus, you know,
the passive gas exchange, that really
[SPEAKER_05]: comes down to when you have an agitation
state of flour, you have a tremendous
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of volatile organic compounds that
are within the headspace of your container
[SPEAKER_05]: or vessel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by doing a burp, which is really a
full evacuation or flushing, you're
[SPEAKER_05]: expelling those volatile organic compounds
out of the package.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once, you know, that, you know,
when you open up, you know, that package,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so depending on some devices,
they might say, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they might be reinforcing the science of,
well, you have a monolayer of humidity
[SPEAKER_05]: that's kind of protecting the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure, but once that product's agitated
and broken, you should really be hit with
[SPEAKER_05]: an overwhelming, you know, smell and
that's the volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you go into a facility and
they're, you know, burping and purging
[SPEAKER_05]: containers and, you know, the cure room
and the dry room is being burped and you
[SPEAKER_05]: smell that, that's not what I want to see
in a cure and storage room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to, you know, I want to see that a
little bit under controlled setting in
[SPEAKER_05]: your dry stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: But under your cure stage, that to me,
that's major qualitative loss points.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're opening that, so you're agitating
that flower, you're exposing it to the raw
[SPEAKER_05]: air.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're releasing a ton of,
oh wow, that room smells great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That flower's going to be loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a qualitative, that's a potential
qualitative loss point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when we talk about burping as
being an art form, that is an art form
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're having to do it by hand and
you're not able to, you know, and it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: out different every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when you're doing it to that
extent, it is an art form, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't have to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's an art form because it's been a
response to the physiological nature of
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant and our understanding of how to
process it and handle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at, at this stage in our industry,
we, we know and have researched and
[SPEAKER_05]: explored and have quantitative basis that
directly correlate to these, these
[SPEAKER_05]: qualitative metrics, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you might say, for example,
what's this guy talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: We all have the classic 90 degree stem
test, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where a stem should bend and then snap at,
you know, cleanly at 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well that directly correlates to about
5.5, 8.59 water activity level,
[SPEAKER_05]: my experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is, there is a degree of very,
you can get into very degrees of
[SPEAKER_05]: variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nuance is a variation for cultivation
style or cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by cultivar, I mean dominant terpium
profiles, which is very interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: we can get into a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a, that's a pretty consistent
standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then saying, well, you know,
what's, what's my bound versus,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, free water in the plan?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's, what's really ideal?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the definitive, definitive,
you know, litmus test point when flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: done drying and entering current?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I would say very,
very clearly, you know, James has 0.58 to
[SPEAKER_05]: 0.59.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all day I would say 0.62.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that's a little too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you have a very little bit more,
you know, top line, you know, moisture
[SPEAKER_05]: weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the flower cannot use that much
unbound water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a dramatically higher increase in
microbial.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could really get into,
you know, dive into the science there,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's, that's really where we know we
want to be a flower in terms of both this
[SPEAKER_05]: optimized health state and it's often,
it's optimized, you know, bound water
[SPEAKER_05]: content for actually weight at point of
sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we focus all of that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I'm, I'm limited in being outdoor
grower to mother nature, but for indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like your operation here,
the one we toured earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're God growing, as I say,
and you have control over that ambient and
[SPEAKER_01]: that existing environment, we put so much
focus on what is you walk into a veg state
[SPEAKER_01]: and you feel the higher humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel how the air is just heavier and
then you feel how it's a bit lighter as we
[SPEAKER_01]: transition into flower with indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we put so much emphasis on
things like that, that ambient RH,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it seems to get a bit of lot of
loss of focus post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we're finding just
statistically, you know, there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: average of six touch points between
takedown and consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this chain of custody, like to your
point and what Jack was mentioning with
[SPEAKER_01]: our friends up in Canada, finding that
there's opportunities for a fail on what
[SPEAKER_01]: should be that top notch end product
because of the fact that you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: variance in your relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a variance in your ambient
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, to his point, not to pick on
Canada, but health Canada did kind of miss
[SPEAKER_01]: the mark on having more strict regulations
around that chain of custody because
[SPEAKER_01]: something goes to his point from what
might be an ideal temperature and ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity room or space for this
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into a truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be out in freezing temperatures,
truck crossing over from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever Ontario to Quebec.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden that product is
brought back up to a room temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really shocking the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to educate growers that you and
I talked about this all the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing is only half the battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any smart grower, and I respect it full
term, weeks on weeks on weeks on weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: months of waiting for this plant to be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can mess it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mess it up in the dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mess it up in the cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Jack's point, you can mess it up in the
processing, the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even putting it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're trying to get people
to focus more, because there is a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't realize you chop
the plant from its life force.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a crazy thing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The studies and going back to the study
that we're going to be releasing next
[SPEAKER_01]: week, we did it with our friends at CRC,
Dr. Alison Justice, who's very focused
[SPEAKER_01]: like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: She loves terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: She loves that whole post-harvest element.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where she focuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things that we are finding are
staggering.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as what's going on to your point in
a typical, you know, metalizer Met-Pet
[SPEAKER_01]: package, a Mylar package, if you will,
versus in something like terplock,
[SPEAKER_01]: versus something like a glass jar or a
glass jar or a Met-Pet pack with,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, a humidity pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like seeing where like certain things that
you add into that environment actually
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the oxygen, which we don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want oxidant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love CBN, but I love THC over
CBN any day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want a little bit of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we kind of get back to
curated gases.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the same as we know now that a lot of
us, a lot of guys are focusing on,
[SPEAKER_05]: in their gardens, gas mixtures in the
rooms, pumping CO2 one down in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually ideal gas mixtures for the
plant in terms of post-harvest respiratory
[SPEAKER_05]: environment because you still have
residual enzymatic processes and biologic
[SPEAKER_05]: processes going on even if the plant is no
longer in its primary feeding stage of its
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good example of that is us monitoring
and through this study, the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as it takes in CO2 and puts off
oxygen, which is why we love all these
[SPEAKER_01]: bushes and trees and living things around
us where we survive and live, the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is going on post-harvest where we're
seeing instead of taking in CO2 and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on oxygen, it's actually putting
out CO2 with a minute amount of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's these gases that we're studying and
going, how does this affect the sugars?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this affect the terpium profile,
the cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really eye-opening when you do start
kind of pulling back and putting as much
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on post-harvest as you do on harvest
itself and growing itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just as important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Post-harvest, I'd love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's fire this up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the Jam Wild podcast without some
wild?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some, I call it dirt skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some dirt ground skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor for the win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Hallie from Humboldt Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: was on a podcast a while back and we did
the side-by-side with the cocoa versus the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the only variable that we
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the same room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants were grown very, like rose next to
each other and these are the smalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like smalls either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still quality there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't drip as hard as maybe the
bigger buds, but as far as flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy the flavor from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has good ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that that's necessarily a quality
indicator, but a lot of emphasis on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm technically speaking some of the stuff
I've seen in Japan in terms of the living,
[SPEAKER_05]: living soil gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like just the most unbelievable turf
profiles for like very unique,
[SPEAKER_05]: nuanced terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rock wall, cocoa, nothing against
these other mediums, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan does special things with fruits and
vegetables and I'm sure they can apply
[SPEAKER_02]: that to their knowledge with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really praise and admire kind of the
Dutch agricultural tradition as farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: and growers, especially I hear in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not talk enough about Korean and
Japanese sourage, native farming and soil
[SPEAKER_05]: practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some of the best growers I know in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking very small, few rooms,
one room, couple rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff's always sold out to one guy and no
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you don't know anybody,
good luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never see the flower type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know those folks, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy considers just his dirt,
the most valuable, valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been working on that dirt and that
dirt profile for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all starts, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as a craft product,
I do enjoy soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use cocoa in my facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use rock wool for moms and we use for
the plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use rock wool is what stone wool,
stone wool is what they're calling it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone wool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many cup winners do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we, we, well, we have a
sterile facility or as sterile as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically have a closed circuit system
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not bringing in new things that
could introduce pests or any sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's like we do everything
from tissue culture, our seeds that we
[SPEAKER_02]: pop, even we test those to make sure we
don't have viruses and Veroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as smoking, the best of the
best I do enjoy soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and there's nothing wrong
with rock wool or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're both great substrates and
they both have their purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're masters of every medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking a lot of rock wool weed,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I wasn't even told till after
like three months that, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, that's all, that's all grown with
Grodan dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Grodan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them as a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them as people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the people that work for the
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which matters.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me that matters, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As a small business owner, as someone who
builds a, a, their work culture with good
[SPEAKER_02]: employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of respect for companies that
have good people that work for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there, if, let me put some fucking
asterisk on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, if, if the, there's gotta
be people at that company that have been
[SPEAKER_05]: there for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I, I, you know,
like every industry has ebbs and flows and
[SPEAKER_05]: growths and booms and buzz, but it's the
only guys that have been in a business for
[SPEAKER_05]: more than, you know, three years of the,
the owners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, that's, that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red flags, red flags all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's like a guy with no old
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I see you guys at shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to the same shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Royal gold, turplock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you guys are staples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I enjoy going to events and
hanging out with Lance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't go to as many events,
but I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to a lot of events.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a lot of time in California in
25.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, California, I mean,
you gotta, damn, California is a brew
[SPEAKER_05]: brutal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brutal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's tough to come in and be like,
Oh, I have a new way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of people are like,
fuck off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hard sell, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the reason our sale is so
consultative, be like, I want you to try
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect what you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've smoked your gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought your gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I'm going to give you some
bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how I want you to try them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how I want you to use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of the SOP.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the philosophy behind the SOP.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be consultative.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get people to be able to try
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a hard sell because there's so
much snake oil and there's so many people
[SPEAKER_02]: saying I have the best product and it's
not the best product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you guys actually do have
the best product that I've seen for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for curing for long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys are a great solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tested, you know, I was working with JJ
and we tested the actual seed storage and
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some exciting work we've made on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The R&D team is doing a lot of,
a lot of cool stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, with, with groups like CRC really
pushing forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even, even some of the stuff that,
you know, our colleagues in the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I will say, you know,
Canada Troll is doing a, focusing on a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of the right stuff in terms of free water
and bound water and kind of their,
[SPEAKER_05]: their philosophies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really, you know, I'm really
impressed with, you know, some of our
[SPEAKER_05]: colleagues and then the space in general,
just even, you know, and that are trying
[SPEAKER_05]: to service this category in terms of how,
how much deeper the, the knowledge base is
[SPEAKER_05]: and how much more scientific and,
you know, want the, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: best, best product to win.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, well, you know, hopefully we,
we out innovate ourselves versus someone
[SPEAKER_05]: out, out innovating us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to do that, but it's, it's a very
exciting time in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're, we're learning more about the true
physiology of the plant and we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: learn more in the next year than we have
collectively learned as an industry over
[SPEAKER_05]: the last 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's so wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, just learning about the plant
for, for me, from a cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint, with different cultivars in
different places like St. Vincent and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Grenadines where I've been and Washington
state and growing outdoors and comparing
[SPEAKER_02]: the two, you know, it's, it's a beautiful
thing when you can start comparing and
[SPEAKER_02]: contrasting using different climates for
the same genetics and being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: compare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they've been doing ag forever
and now we're able to do it really focused
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the software, we have the manpower
and like the amount of learning that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to do in such a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to what's been happening before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was with the gentleman today and
we're, we're going through his facility
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've got, you know, we're kind of
five years of hard, true data across every
[SPEAKER_05]: variable for the life cycle of all the
flower that has came through the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's, you know, Hey, I'm talking,
you know, temperature chain of custody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking, you know, um, moisture
content, not water activity, but moisture,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, still doing a lot of moisture
content.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chain of custody gas, gas mixtures in the
room, um, life cycles, all, all
[SPEAKER_05]: variabilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's, it's really, it's, it's
fascinating in terms of, and this was in
[SPEAKER_05]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, I think, you know, I think he
told me to tell you hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll share who it is offline,
but yeah, but he's creating SOPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just for the operation and its
totality, but he's creating SOPs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar specific, which is pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking to this gentleman, who comes
from the technology space, which I respect
[SPEAKER_01]: that was my other life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he is looking at it from such an
objective perspective and he's stepping
[SPEAKER_01]: back and going, okay, I need to make this
the most efficient it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so think Jack and I were talking
about, you know, I, I'm like you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more of a land race guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect the new stuff, which Jack is all
into, but he's like, these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the SOPs I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he puts them in rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows what he's growing a year and a
half out from now, which is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how scheduled and how regimented he
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know who this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who this is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I mean, talk to him and like
this, like, it's next level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's getting into light spectrums
where we're, we're driving light pigments.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of, kind of jumping all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, that's, that's, you know,
that's a obsession, but boy, what Lance is
[SPEAKER_05]: building on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a great philosophy to have
in a facility is, you know, we're
[SPEAKER_05]: removing, removing opportunities for
variabilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're removing opportunities for error.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing opportunities for mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of the SOP workflow processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, it's, you know,
this was so much more of a, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: automotive production facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was widgets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was referencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking at it as a widget,
which is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes I think those of us who are
emotionally attached to this plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: compassionate for it, like we do kind of
miss stepping back and going, let's look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it objectively.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a real estate developer that
falls in love with the building and gets
[SPEAKER_05]: totally underwater on the building and,
you know, and let's then chase the
[SPEAKER_05]: building down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same, same, same type of concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think you have to have vision
and romance to be a builder of anything
[SPEAKER_05]: real real estate too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also need to tamper that and be
like, I'm, I'm in love with this building,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm, I'm, the world is not in love
with this building.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let it go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same way, same way, you know, chasing a
strain or a new skew or a new product or a
[SPEAKER_05]: new innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you have to be devoted to the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's like a devotional thing,
but I have a, I have a business partner
[SPEAKER_02]: who's my balance, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a whole team of people that,
you know, I can start chasing stuff down
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbit holes real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's like, you got to stay
balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, and it's not a yin and yang,
but your partner, you guys are very well
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is interesting because you respect
what he brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: He respects it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring to the table, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need that just in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's one thing that came up
again in this conversation was I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you've toured any of the family
grows in Hawaii, but that's what I talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about was how, you know, those people pass
on the genetics from generation to
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep growing the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not chasing the latest candies or
dessert cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the interesting thing too,
with this individual is he's doing a rinse
[SPEAKER_01]: and repeat, but the thing is he's got the
clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he pre-sells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know very few guys that pre-sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very the cottage sub-acre guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guys that are scaled not so much
in this guy pre-sells a majority of his
[SPEAKER_01]: flower because they know what they're
going to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the best guys all pre-sell the
majority with guys that are above a
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of guys that scale that
are like a thousand pounds a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprised me with this bigger than a large
homes basement footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a handful of guys doing that,
but it is impressive because he's proving
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know, not to get into a bigger
and philosophical, it's a whole tangent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it makes you step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we visit our friends up at CBCB in
Berkeley, you know, shout out to Jimmy and
[SPEAKER_01]: the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was asking them like,
what's hot, what's not, what's moving,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeing some of the classic like saw
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to see an LL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to see, what was the other
one was a Durban poison, which I question
[SPEAKER_01]: it's purity, but I'm like, does that sell
compared to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean for us, like we're, we're,
you know, we live world peace through
[SPEAKER_05]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we, we like our teams, like we,
you know, Julian's, you know, been to
[SPEAKER_05]: Durban, you know, and like, so we,
yeah, I know real Durban.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, you know, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have not seen a lot of real Durban
in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Durban and it was part of like
foundational for the group that I work
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the things along with sour
diesel and a bunch of things back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is if I smelled real
Durban right now, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of this hazy stuff is not the
real Durban that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it leans towards this,
this hazy side and there's nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: with that, but it's not the Durban that I
remember that was really, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was really big and it had bright orange
hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost like yarn growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember as kids, it really was
consumers or enthusiasts or had,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like, I got to tell you,
James, I don't even know how much I care
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's like not that authentic a Durban
because it's getting, it's getting more
[SPEAKER_05]: people and more consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, we're talking about a
smoker's dispensary, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, there's casual
dispensaries and there's dispensaries for
[SPEAKER_05]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's smokers dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, where we're talking about a
product, if you're getting people
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in land races and genetic
profiles and terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think diversity, especially
pushing the agenda for diversity within
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant, we keep bothering and
bottlenecking ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe did it with Hayes a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it with gelatos from, from cookies
to gelato to this candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got like a nice, nice, nice social
high energy, kind of clean ZI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proper flush, proper cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm golden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think pushing the agenda on getting
people reintroduced to land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a lot of the stuff I'm doing is
taking old genetics and mixing them with
[SPEAKER_02]: the new stuff and trying to reintroduce
them that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I always liked about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you do, very few guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like sharing that experience with
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we had Dave from Budge
Olaro on our podcast and he's really
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing the long flowering variety agenda
and trying to reintroduce people to these
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuban pests that are like you're running
out to like late 70s, 80 days more.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some pearls, you know,
like, I mean, those things are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they need to be shared with
people because it's about an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can get people to try those
things in the right environment and they
[SPEAKER_02]: get the same experience that you do,
they'll fall in love with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be curated.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a, you know, there's a viability
to it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's kind of one of the cruel
sides of the market is people have to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you've got to grow to pay bills.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to grow, grow for yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're growing for resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody can grow a 16 week variety
and be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people can't, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a niche market for the people
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people don't have any business that's
built for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really need to have a facility
that's geared towards growing this type of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to have a model that can sustain,
you know, a production cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even at that, even as a home,
I think I told you this, I got some first
[SPEAKER_01]: round from coastal Seaco down,
you know, just through a friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: just asked if I could do first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a Xehuatnaya cross with ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very land race heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing was the longest term I
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even as a home grower, to your point,
like wanting it as medicine or just being
[SPEAKER_01]: cognizant of the season and the bandwidth
you have in your spare time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pain in the ass, man,
to run it a month or two longer than I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a grower, you know, the end product was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, but it was like,
geez, man, like it's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grow some soil, a sour diesel
next year outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my goal is to grow the real sour
diesel cut next year outdoor, just for
[SPEAKER_02]: personal, because I love it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's when I do have true seeds
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, there's no, you will not find sour
diesel, real sour diesel, in my opinion in
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been searching finally at Reggae.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Dave and he's got the real cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is the only real sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember one sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can argue about all these different
sour diesels.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I remember as sour diesel is what
Dave has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, there might be other
sours, iterations, derivatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm most excited from just a consumer
head, you know, perspective, like about
[SPEAKER_05]: what he's working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause to me, that's the most authentic,
like the, you know, like the kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: the throat kind of the, I remember the
resinous smoke and had a very distinct
[SPEAKER_05]: term, but like really like, like kind of
coughed your throat, almost like kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like retched, like it's kind of,
you had a film on your throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you like, you know exactly what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it had to be harvested correctly,
it had to be dried and cured and stored
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise it wouldn't have that expression
that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a punch to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a thickness or a, not like a creamy
smoothness, but a cream like they could
[SPEAKER_05]: play with like milk to the smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would coat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, it was just like a great
batch was just in intense resin,
[SPEAKER_05]: like resin like that on most flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You not want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be like, Oh, this is better for
washing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it, yeah, I've, um, there's a reason
so many people are chasing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's reasons so many people
are excited that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are, you know, and there's a lot of
people that think they've seen it because
[SPEAKER_02]: they've seen a derivative, but they've
never seen the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat piss is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like those things, like in their
optimal environment, cured, dried
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly, grown correctly, checking all
those boxes along the way, all those touch
[SPEAKER_02]: points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get this amazing thing,
but that's the beauty of cannabis is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very difficult to grow and
difficult to execute properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each time is slightly different on a
craft level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, it's, it's a qualitative
expression of a, you know, of a,
[SPEAKER_05]: of a, of a crop, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's, that's the fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the joy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, that's the passenger,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you talk like, you know,
the, the heads of the cigar space,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you talked like, you know,
old man, but drone, the drone,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, cigar company is a lot of
tobacco, vertically integrated tobacco
[SPEAKER_05]: company from, you know, from genetics,
you know, from Cuban seed that they took
[SPEAKER_05]: when they were refugees from, from Cuba,
um, to, you know, their, their harvesting
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, it's a fermented product,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Big, big difference there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is not, not fermented in what in
terms of where we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: aging, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, kind of, you know, the,
the, admitting the, the natural
[SPEAKER_05]: variability to it, being the element to
it, you, you, that, that is the thrill of
[SPEAKER_05]: like the great, you know, great bag or
like popping, you know, that seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, for, for people that truly
in the know that can appreciate that,
[SPEAKER_05]: like inexplicably, like, you know,
this, this batch of cigars, like these,
[SPEAKER_05]: these cigars in this corner of this box,
these, these were the hitters out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where they're similar,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're, you're, we're talking,
you know, the genetics, but Gino and Fino
[SPEAKER_01]: are a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked about the side by side with
soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's John from raised cannabis,
good buddy of mine up out of Soham.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he had surprised me every year
and he'd bring down, I remember one year
[SPEAKER_01]: when wedding cake was popping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't tell me he brought in all of
his, he always would bring in a dozen jars
[SPEAKER_01]: to Emerald cup and just through the side
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he put three jars in front of me and
he's like, which one of these three are
[SPEAKER_01]: your favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I picked the one which was my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, but they, they all have a
similar profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, these are all wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all, wedding cake indoor wedding cake
like that wedding cake outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You chose the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane how different these three
plants looked at the end of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: just based on how they, in all,
all soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the crazy part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, it's environmental outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going through very different light
spectrums, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Light spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, the Appalachians of
the, I mean, he was 45 minutes Issa Acer,
[SPEAKER_01]: so he doesn't even get much of the fog
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole different world there versus
the rock or versus Fort Bragg,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's insane, but that does make
an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where a lot of the argument was
around respecting the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what makes it a true Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you replicate that sun spectrum indoor
and take that soil indoor and create all
[SPEAKER_01]: the other, the fog bank and all these
other factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was decided, no, you can't
literally, it has to be within these
[SPEAKER_01]: quadrants and it has to be grown here in
order to be champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if it's outside of the champagne
region, it's called sparkling wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So marketing thing too, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's Prosecco's that,
that hit and everything else, but it's
[SPEAKER_05]: already, you know, the same thing in,
you know, Scotch versus whiskey,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you kind of really start to get
into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like, well, you know,
in cannabis, you know, you talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: what, you know, we were talking about some
of the, the hash you've got there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when the rise and whatnot,
you talk about single mall versus,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, versus blended, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you talk about single mall,
some people would say, well, you can go,
[SPEAKER_05]: you got a limited number of flavor
profiles and single mall, which is one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the reasons why we blend have,
you know, the richness of the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's, that's why hash makers
blend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm not the interviewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're getting deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious and not to flip it,
James, I always do this to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm curious of your thought because as
much as we've done, you know, Genesis have
[SPEAKER_01]: done a great job of blending up and taking
the best of the haze and the best of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gas and the best of the sour, all these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I'm starting to come across
a little bit more is people blending,
[SPEAKER_01]: which this is very similar to wine where
they're taking a Saraz and Merlot out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia and make it, but I'm starting to
see people do that with blending
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about this on my last podcast a
little bit about hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the future of the hash is
going to be blending, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's rosin or whatever it's here
already, but I see it just growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have somebody who's who loves
the plant and who enjoys that process,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can come up with some wild
combinations that you couldn't get from
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can get an interesting look at
breeding if you combine two things and you
[SPEAKER_02]: like smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, well, maybe this is what I
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never pencils out quite like that,
but it's an interesting way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like they do it with wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it with so many things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I got to sit in on a
Helios.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are out of Maine, do a killer
job, you know, a lot of us know who they
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: No shout out to homie Mike, but I got to
kind of just kind of blending and tasting
[SPEAKER_05]: and testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can use, you know, polar opposite
terpenes, Hesco terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can't do that with one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't produce a spectrum of terpenes,
you know, flavors, flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever you want to call it, in one
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because certain terpene profiles
cannot exist in harmony with one plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I want to find, you know,
I think I brought this up with you because
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you have it in your
collection, but Julie from Sweetgrass out
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado, she always ran Sueno and
Sueno is a literal cross of Sour D and
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream, the two most selling strains
of the 2000s period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had all the access to that
information of weed maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to run both of those and then
consume it and see what the similarities
[SPEAKER_01]: are to Sueno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Sueno was a very unique where,
like, if you wanted to lock and watch
[SPEAKER_01]: Netflix, you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you wanted to bust out the vacuum,
it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cool with that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was this really unique balance of
these two extreme worlds that always were
[SPEAKER_01]: segregated for all those years,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I was just curious in asking
you, Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think blends are the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tasted this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many months ago was this harvested?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a little test here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys were to guess on the age of
that product, what would you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go all in several months,
several months.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is several months?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is some seriously aged flower,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not taste fresh to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like it's definitely been cured
in age, not just cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say take down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was last season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for sure, that was last season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super smooth though, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I argue and the Italians
taught me and I totally believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a study out of, with the lab in
Lompoc.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can believe that's six to eight months
old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was the smoothness of it and the
way it's burning.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flower is so stabilized.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's one thing you can take from
the tobacco industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is some trop cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put this in a turplock 10 months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been saving this for Lance to come on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so smooth, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, 10 months in the turplock in a 60
degree room, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, so seller for the way you have to
be perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, I know what you're doing
with trying it, but like it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, it's smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it checks the boxes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like from a joint, we got a
beautiful ash forming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a, we got a nice ring forming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but the secret is the,
the turplock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I have talked about this,
James, like seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, I think it was a year before we
did the Epic interview that, that never
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up coming into fruition out in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I met these Italians, sorry guys,
I'm repeating the story, but met these
[SPEAKER_01]: Italians and they started going on to me
about not just curing, but aging the
[SPEAKER_01]: button.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, where are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, it's just like wine with the
terpenes and maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, in my opinion, you're a phenomenal
grower and I already hype you to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to everyone I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I love your flower, but that is so
smooth, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no ting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, and I mean, you flushed it
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you cured it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but that is extremely smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I age my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have stuff that's two years old and
people are like, what the fuck do you turn
[SPEAKER_01]: into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I do love, everyone knows I'm an
Edibles guy, but no, a lot of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I save it to smoke because it changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like fresh flower too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, but I feel like
there's, there's some, I love testing
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, well, how long can we keep
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it still taste good?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are the turps still there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I smoked some five year old
stuff on my freezer the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the best, but it wasn't
completely bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was better than what most people smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than the dime bags we're
getting as kids, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the average stuff that you buy the
dispenser even like it still had enough
[SPEAKER_02]: turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how are you bringing it back to
temperature?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we definitely need to talk about dew
points before we go too far.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things we're talking about in
terms of curing wine, again, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: not a fermented product, but in terms of
curing wine, wine cures differently in
[SPEAKER_05]: different bottle sizes because it has for
different interior, interior dew points,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people like, well, I'd rather
rather have a batch, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather have, you know, this great
year, this great vintage, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the James wrote loud, you know,
you know, cherry from early 2024,
[SPEAKER_05]: you get a jar of bottom size volumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually awful, you know,
optimal batch size for the curing and
[SPEAKER_05]: storage of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I have my own very rustic way
of doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice way to put it, but I do a
sandwich bag with an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wrapped that in the sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I vacuum seal it loosely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I label it and I put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we definitely got to get you our safe
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're still going to get a safe back
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to surprise you guys with
something since you guys surprised me with
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know you guys were bringing new
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The official launch for your view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this would be perfect timing,
but the official launch will be at Terp
[SPEAKER_01]: Nami.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terp Nami will be there together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if this will air before Terp
Nami or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, you guys is a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, on a tangent really quick
with Terp Nami, I mean, the amount you
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously man, some great friends,
but the genetics, like this is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, and I'm going to go a
little bit of parallel and love Tim and
[SPEAKER_01]: Taylor, but the Emerald Cup that I
remember that I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why it was such a pivotal
part for me was because I'd get to go up
[SPEAKER_01]: there and taste the latest flavors off the
Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on what flavors I liked or
what flavors won, we would go queue up at
[SPEAKER_01]: those booths and purchase those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of gone away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the cool thing at Terp Nami is
bringing it back and inviting dozens of
[SPEAKER_01]: geneticists, James Loud, Ridgeline,
Humboldt, et cetera, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: having these guys come out, bring their
best seed to the table, but then have a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand growers show up that want this
limited edition stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we scared people with the amount of
cultivars we brought out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got this big phenohunt that's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're constantly phenohunting new stuff
and then also testing it again and testing
[SPEAKER_02]: it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go through redundancies and also
multiple rounds of testing with everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do to make sure that we're
providing people with the best thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't just settle on one thing right
away, because as the plant grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: it changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you take different clonal
generations, it changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this sexual maturity that goes on
within the plant from the initial seed run
[SPEAKER_02]: to the second or third clonal generation,
where it starts to stabilize a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's, you know,
fun made old adage, you know, moms get
[SPEAKER_05]: tired.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why tissue culture is such an
interesting thing to so many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we got a lab that does tissue
culture right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tissue culture for banking,
typical, you know, I think most companies
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have tissue culture right now,
but I think we're moving towards having
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture in most facilities,
like large facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're becoming more aware of
viruses and steroids and the impact that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're bringing into the industry as a
whole, like as a percentage even.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think having clean genetics is super
important, especially if you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery, being able to say that you have
clean genetics and that you're selling
[SPEAKER_02]: clean genetics, that's super important,
whether it's seed or whether it's clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fluid.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about, you know,
you're talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: kite dancing and, you know, a storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, it's, you know,
it's undeniably the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's just, it's difficult,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, it's all how mature,
how all mature agricultural industries
[SPEAKER_05]: operate for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not for the most part in totality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the clone, that, that goes back to
into your point and you see it over in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe because you're out there dang near
as much as we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't mean it has to be like
bananas, where everything is a Cavendish
[SPEAKER_05]: banana because it's grown for,
you know, it's a resistance, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: to mold and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because bananas already went
through one extinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but it is a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like I said, you see it out
there with Austria being the capital of
[SPEAKER_01]: clones because they're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're keeping them sterile and clean
because in my opinion, this is why I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: gen seed grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, why we get along so well is
because I'm not in for, I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else's problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's the thing I have with an issue
with a lot of the clone producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love how sterile and futuristic
monitors are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the seed producers though,
these days you can't be careful enough
[SPEAKER_02]: with that because hoplite and virid
transmits through seed production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people were like,
well, what if it's just the donor that has
[SPEAKER_02]: it, then will they get it through the
pollen?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer I believe is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it from both parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they both have it, you're going to get
more like a basically higher viral load
[SPEAKER_02]: and a larger population of your seeds
getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot we don't know about it
still, but there's quite a bit that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I respect Sharon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I respect getting stopped in
secondary coming back from spandibus the
[SPEAKER_01]: other year was because unfortunately guys
with, but we had seeds and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they brought over, you know, obviously the
ag guy, thankfully he was pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: His, his mom and dad both grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course he's from Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a guy at LAX and you know,
so he's definitely supportive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you know, these, these seeds
aren't sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't know if these seeds are
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately we can't let you bring,
and I totally respected it going to a
[SPEAKER_01]: school like Cal Poly with a bunch of
Aggies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause to your point, a lot of people don't
realize that the seeds are, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you see more of the whites, the widespread
coming from the clones because it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the viral load is really small
when it's from seed initially too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as you take clonal generations from
that plant and that plant gets stressed
[SPEAKER_02]: out and develops other things like
systemic bacteria and fungal pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: then the hoplatin virus, it's latent
because it doesn't express and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of people that don't
think they have it and they do have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're in denial, you probably
definitely have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another one of those problems
within our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, but this is where again,
and you lead with education.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full circle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lead with education, but the people are
doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the lead with education and help
like your viewers understand why you do
[SPEAKER_01]: the things you do and how you do the
things you do because you're wanting that
[SPEAKER_01]: end result to be a better finished
product, which is going back to why Jack's
[SPEAKER_01]: so passionate about creating this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how can I make that end product
better?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not for my older brother, who's a
medical patient for every user and every
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer of flour, no matter where you are
in what market, wherever flour is present,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's a way to optimize it,
make it better and lean into technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean into technology a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like trying to do data driven reading
and trying to improve everything that we
[SPEAKER_02]: do every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, sometimes we have to
make gradual improvements over time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the idea is not to just rest on our
laurels and you know, that we fit,
[SPEAKER_02]: we figured it all out because it's just
not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many things to be innovative
with in cannabis within this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Innovation is here, but innovation needs
to continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm seeing it like MJ biz for a
couple of years, there wasn't much
[SPEAKER_02]: innovation and we started seeing stuff
with led lights and now the led innovation
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of taken over and we haven't
stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they got under canopy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side canopy under canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is inner canopy, inner canopy side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in every category of the ancillary
side of the industry, that kind of play
[SPEAKER_05]: out, you know, but I, you know,
the rate of innovation flows, the rate of
[SPEAKER_05]: consolidation accelerates, you know,
it's not a lot of new ideas and lighting,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, they, everyone agrees on
what the, you know, the best ideas are.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's intense competition driving,
you know, those particular areas forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I think there is, you know,
pretty cohesive, a lot of cohesion now,
[SPEAKER_05]: leds leds light forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of conversation
about watch optimization and obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: just balancing red and blue, red and blue
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, spectrum tuning is a thing
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's not done right by everybody,
but I think people are understanding light
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum a lot more, you know,
now that you're able to tune the lights
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's like, uh, that's changing the
game a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all these small minor adjustments
that can make the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the next one that's going to be
hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next innovation is going to be hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next area that everybody really nerds out
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think kind of the innovation waves
go based off category based off what
[SPEAKER_05]: people's talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, focus on there's definitely,
there's been a couple new way nutrient
[SPEAKER_05]: waves, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's been a couple, a couple
genetics and you know, uh, tissue culture
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of w waves around on production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then one wave around, you know,
kind of post-harvest storage and
[SPEAKER_05]: post-harvest management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a couple of waves around facility
automation and management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics has made their waves and
constantly is making their way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics always will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's always going to be,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think cause that, uh, people are
chasing flavors and they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also there's these trends and these trends
go through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we, we're not fully
there yet with extraction because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: still trying new things and coming out
with new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this Rosin wave is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what they've been doing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, also, I think we can go back
to hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've loved the evolution away from
that as a natural thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's certain, not that I'm a huge
concentrate again, definitely lover of
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles, but you know, they are derived
from concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found stuff that's like, you know,
like your BHOs and CO2 extractions for
[SPEAKER_01]: some reason, just as different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I get hangovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different, but I think being able to
separate the cannabinoids and for drug
[SPEAKER_02]: discovery and other things like that,
I think there's still like this wave that
[SPEAKER_02]: we haven't really got to yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with federal legalization on the,
on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cause you're a sun grown old head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scientifically speaking, brother,
like, you know, I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The science, scientifically speaking,
um, there are terpene profiles and,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, cannabinoids better captured,
um, uh, better captured with a hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_05]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are certain profiles that are lost
in water extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's certainly different processes that
are more ideal for, you know, digestion
[SPEAKER_05]: versus topicals versus whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I see sifts coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dry, the dry sift in the static hash is
now a thing and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, you know, and they're like,
they're making it out to be like a new
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, this is like one of the
original processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just making it more advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like hydrosol, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't everyone, the guys up on the
hill used to, with, you know, just the
[SPEAKER_01]: trim stuff, they'd put it through a
hydrosol and uses topicals and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd love to see back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the innovation, which is a good
segue to go back to the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The innovation is going to be around how
people view what they want to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think it really is going to get to
a point where people are finally going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get over this fricking D with the highest
THC wins bullshit and finally move into
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the profile for me, which again
goes back to why I love your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of it is convenience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in this world that's very
convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pens, rosin carts are great by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's been a great innovation
that they've pushed forward and done some
[SPEAKER_02]: really amazing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hand rolls, I call them hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people call them pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say hand roll, it defines it as
something that's more of a high-end
[SPEAKER_02]: product that hands actually touched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-rolls we think of the popcorn and the
revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where people grind up in a blender and
they make it, that's not this.
Throw it in a knockbox.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the hand roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it plays well into the
culinary side of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, the Gannet business is
inextricably linked to the culinary arts
[SPEAKER_05]: and culinary business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of our most successful
colleagues in the space have a very strong
[SPEAKER_05]: culinary background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's a lot of axioms of
thinking and values that transition very
[SPEAKER_05]: well between the two spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think hand roll, hand rolls,
it's a good name, but we have to remember,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there's a whole, whole industry
or whole vast swaths of the industry that
[SPEAKER_05]: are not for people that are enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's difficult to remember, but we have to
remember that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been talking a lot about beer
analogies lately, and I think there's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely some nuances between our
culture and cannabis and being a beer
[SPEAKER_05]: head.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's 7,000 craft breweries in the
United States, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have fun and they create a new
category and they're doing good business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's awesome and it's fun,
but that's only about 10% of the beer
[SPEAKER_05]: consumption in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 16 companies doing a crowd for
approximately the other 90%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even more than that, I think it's six
companies that are 60% of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must be counting Molson Coors twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm citing that study, but I don't think
we're crazy far away from that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is consolidated far more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's like the pre-rolls that
make the most money as far as like take up
[SPEAKER_02]: the largest part of the market share are
the one gram dollar joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw in Canada, not just the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, half grams and quarter grams,
but I think what gets sold mostly is those
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap, cheap, whether it's one or $2
joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love those, you know, cause you get
high and it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are okay with not
having the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to chase the best cause I want to be
the craft guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, I think that's my
identity, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have identities on who we are and
what type of market we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I want something for everybody
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look on my site for seeds,
like we have stuff that's priced where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's priced for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have stuff that's $500 a pack for five
seeds or 10 seeds, five seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for 500 is the most expensive
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have some stuff where for 45 bucks,
you can get a pack of seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this business school models for,
for this crap, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with the, the Brad's and Chad's
and Thad's, you know, brought us right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Karen's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Karen's Karen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not that, you know, Brad's and Thad's
and Chad's aren't, aren't diverse and
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't really just a, you know,
a broad, broad term.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, you've got your
fundamental, you know, your value
[SPEAKER_05]: proposition, your, you know, middle of the
road and then your, your high end,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're a lot of us in this space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really have thought about it as a very
linear, very polar thing where you're
[SPEAKER_05]: either, you know, you're either Louis
Vuitton or you're Walmart or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: where you, where you're at and this
different thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's actually a, you know,
you could say it's a big grid or it's even
[SPEAKER_05]: a three dimensional cube of, you know,
where, where you're at in terms of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis value chain and what you're doing
and depending on who you are and what your
[SPEAKER_05]: business is, you know, it could be
perfectly okay that you make something
[SPEAKER_05]: that only, you know, one out of a hundred
cannabis people like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if that was one out of a hundred
cannabis people fucking love it and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're, they're about it and they're,
they're nuts for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there you, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a home.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, if you're doing something that
people love, you have a home and you have
[SPEAKER_05]: a space for the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know who I want to be and I
identify with mostly is being the Bob Weir
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to support all those Jerry Garcia's
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those cultivators that do amazing that
are providing this experience for the
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to be the Velcro and the
Gore-Tex for the people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm trying to do with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're best rhythm guitar player of all
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best musicians in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just an amazing guy with no ego
and that's who I strive to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be Louis Vuitton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be Gucci.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's anything wrong with
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be Robert play,
but I definitely want to work with Robert
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and I want to work with Jimi
Hendrix's and the guy, the best of the
[SPEAKER_02]: best, you know, it's, I feel like that's
my position in this world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're, you know, you know, guitar maker
at Fender.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for, for us and you know,
we've, we've certainly talked about it and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of soulful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Searching and trying to, you know,
build.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when you, when you came on
board, you know, you were the first person
[SPEAKER_05]: ever to be like, all right, well,
how do we market this and create a brand
[SPEAKER_05]: and try to get more people to try this
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I, you know, that's well,
it's marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've always hoped that the,
you know, the, you know, the fur for our
[SPEAKER_05]: brand, like we just want to be your,
your favorite growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, product they use.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, all the, all the best,
you know, hunters you use, use,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, hops number, you know,
number nine, you know, for, for,
[SPEAKER_05]: for their, you know, their deer rifle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, that's not a bad analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we want to just be your, your favorite
growers want to be their favorite,
[SPEAKER_05]: favorite, favorite tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hears me say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we want to be a noun and a verb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to be Uber, which is a ride
share program, which is Lyft, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like want to be that you want to be the
Kleenex of facial tissue, want to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: Coca-Cola of sodas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, and I, with you again,
you know, we're friends, but objectively
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking, man, how you've grown your
brand, because again, you've led with
[SPEAKER_01]: education, but you've led with passion and
putting this community over that corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality that so many people,
like you said, there's plenty of Walmart's
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed out there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to, you have to create value.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to, you have to, you know,
stimulate some sort of conversation and
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to be willing to move with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, particularly with the,
the recent election, everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Elon Musk and Tesla and all that's a very
hot button topic.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of just having the,
you know, the, the, you know, passion for
[SPEAKER_05]: something as a holistically as an
organization, you know, the founder aside,
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put that aside to try to open source
things and do thought leadership and push
[SPEAKER_05]: the space forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, being transparent while at
first off, you know, one of our biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: accounts, you know, their accounts
business, they've dramatically pushed,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, electric vehicle and that,
that conversation forward and everything
[SPEAKER_05]: else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, that kind of that,
and then they're keeping up with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course there are electric car,
you know, rival businesses, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, who cares?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, you know, this is a great thing
for the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that kind of that abundance,
that growth, that, that attitude of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you're, you're not going to have
to innovate us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're telling you this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not even telling you what we're
working on right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like that stuff you've already
worked on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a solutions based company,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so am I.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's one thing that
separates great companies from the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, if you have a problem that you're a
solution to, that's how you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you find too, you know, for us,
there's, you know, imitated, never
[SPEAKER_01]: replicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because not all bags are
created equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will probably be our next marketing
campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, I've explained to these
guys haven't been in a few rodeos,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when you're the leader,
the biggest targets on your back,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and so that's something we're
starting to realize, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ankle biters are biting because
they're seeing what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing that we know,
you know, no matter if it's people who
[SPEAKER_01]: think they're direct competitors or people
are trying to replicate, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in a totally different position
because unlike them, we're actually a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually people who know,
experience and use this product and
[SPEAKER_01]: believe in it, you know, and it came from,
from those that grow from the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely a, you know, a big factor in
it as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, for us and,
you know, chemicals and formulators,
[SPEAKER_05]: we talk about, you know, something that's
patented, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's very easy to move an inert
hydrocar from here to here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, it's, it's a brutal space,
you know, me being in, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a chemical formulations, which is
essentially, you know, what dirt block is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to, you know, I obviously the
way we make it, thankfully it's bad that
[SPEAKER_05]: we have, we have some, some advantages
there, you know, with, with our partners
[SPEAKER_05]: and with our, our supply chain,
but it's, it's constantly have to be at
[SPEAKER_05]: innovating.
[SPEAKER_05]: If, if, you know, somebody, you know,
completely eliminates, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: passive, you know, map packaging is like
the best solution to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's going to be us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe we've been lucky for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we're in the perfect storm for that
being in cannabis, which is so fluid that
[SPEAKER_05]: having that, that, you know, the fluid
attitude and the attitude about we've got
[SPEAKER_05]: to build stuff where the space is headed
instead of where the space is at.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe we've just been very lucky
with that, but you have a good team to
[SPEAKER_02]: your, the innovation you guys have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the bin liner, for instance,
a lot of people don't even know you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: bin liner, but you guys have a bin liner.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of people don't know
different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of bag sizes, like Ryan,
like Ryan Carnibale and Josh Yang were
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, filling, filling different
bags and, you know, hand making bags with
[SPEAKER_05]: a hair straightener, the bag sizes for
this industry that have, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: probably a billion billions of bags have
been made for, for this space now or case
[SPEAKER_05]: packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my father was in the way,
you know, packaging distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, did all sorts of fancy and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like, guys, case pack pounds are so
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why, why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I can't believe this industry
uses case packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, well, I will tell you why,
you know, it's actually, it's because we
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't afford boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's why the case packs were huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're constantly trying to stay ahead
to your point for specifically the tote
[SPEAKER_01]: liner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just widen that by two inches because
all of a sudden there's more than just HDX
[SPEAKER_01]: or what we grew up calling black and
yellows out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're starting to see black and reds,
black and greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them are, you know,
uniform in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a few friends that were like,
Hey dude, I'm kind of having to stretch
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's custom stuff that we do
for facilities that are running,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, some of the home factory farms,
huge facilities and very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, the SOP, once you're getting over,
you know, 60,000 square foot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: space and, you know, the tools and
processes really changed dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where those guys, the thing that I,
you know, I, or I should say the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the, they don't change that dramatically
to scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: It changed dramatically because it's still
Turpelock and it's still, it's still a
[SPEAKER_05]: container, but it's an agricultural
container that the guys are using in the
[SPEAKER_05]: avocado space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an SOP that, and you see that here,
you know, we just turn a facility where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're running our pound bags,
but then going over to Europe where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're running our five kilo bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a, that's a 10 pound bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to Jack's point, but those are licensed
producers, you know, that are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical side in his point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is more of an objective ag perspective
versus a passionate guy who got opened up
[SPEAKER_01]: an opportunity to start being a master
grower at this big operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh man, shout out Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, that's the triangle Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many guys I meet like all over
Europe and it's like, where'd you learn
[SPEAKER_05]: the shirt?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like, where's your plug?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, you know, it's Austria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the legislative environment just
made it a right place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right place, right time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a question for you for sealing your
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have bags and they want to
seal them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the best way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they have some conveyor sealers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the one I recommend, I mean,
it's literally like 15, 20 bucks on Amazon
[SPEAKER_01]: as an example, but you've got the
traditional kind of press heat sealers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I use at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it was an inexpensive first
time buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use a ceramic hair straightener if
you just do a couple of presses on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically the way you seal bags is a
combination of heat and dwell time,
[SPEAKER_05]: dwell time, is essentially how long you're
spending on each part.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to melt it, but you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the, it's the material structure in
a way where it's supposed to heat seal
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I oftentimes we'll use my
fiance's hair straightener to,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used like the vac seal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use a number of heat sealers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you know, I, you don't need,
because of the nature of this material,
[SPEAKER_05]: the nature of cannabis, we would contend
that you don't need to vacuum flush
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, but the heat sealers,
set to a low temperature in a quick adult
[SPEAKER_05]: time is ideal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, given the, the structure that we
run, material structure, you want to use a
[SPEAKER_05]: lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a non-metalized, it's a non-metalized
structure.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely one that I always take
some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've obviously had a few of your new ones
in my bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always travel in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for me at hotels, I just take an
iron, literally just bust the iron out and
[SPEAKER_01]: do it on the countertop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're doing it in delicate any way
or, you know, and just to his point,
[SPEAKER_01]: just let it dwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: For like five, 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set and go.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not even I'm like two Mississippi's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then cause you can always do another
two Mississippi's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The worst is like you're traveling around
Europe and like you've damaged the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got some questions for you about the
business and about building the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the things you learned
along the way with building a business
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd like to share?
[SPEAKER_05]: You learn a lot by doing so many things
wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole other podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's all about people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think by far the most important thing I
do is, is who, who is on the team and how
[SPEAKER_05]: I support them and try to keep them,
you know, what, what they need.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, I think it's a,
it's a Kaizen thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about, you know, it's a,
it's a, it's a daily aspiration,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, a business journey or a
entrepreneurial journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a lot, you know,
I've, I've grown up in this business,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I started this company, you know,
um, with, with, you know, uh, Ryan,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, gosh, you know, nine years ago,
March.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've, you know, very much grown up
in, in, in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, my, my worldview is shaped
by this industry, so to speak in certain
[SPEAKER_05]: ways, but I think, um, who you have and
how you, how you, you take care of them
[SPEAKER_05]: and, and, you know, try to, you know,
have what they need, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people can't do great creative
work if they don't feel safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've always strived to have an
environment where people feel safe and
[SPEAKER_05]: they feel secure and they have an
opportunity to experiment.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, um, Warren Buffett said it best,
you know, he was, God, what was he,
[SPEAKER_05]: what was he trying to fix?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, at the time, I forget it was the bank
he took over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, he was talking about,
you know, if you lose the firm,
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit of money, you know,
I'll be understanding if you, if you
[SPEAKER_05]: damage the firm's reputation, if you take
advantage of a customer, if you,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if you, you know, if you do
something unethical, I'll be ruthless.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the, the balance of the
environment you want to ideally strive
[SPEAKER_05]: for.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of those, you have to have a
product people love.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for, for us, we were very lucky to
develop something that people found a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of value in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think, you know, that and not
getting too over your skis, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: not getting too much for Nicker's
syndrome, you know, not getting to the
[SPEAKER_05]: point where like, Oh, we made some money
this month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me, let me look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: These portions and calculate payments
during the work day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people, people sense that you
gotta be, you gotta, you gotta know who
[SPEAKER_05]: you are and what you're good at,
what you're not good at.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I'm not the best manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not leading and I'm not organizing,
you know, MJ BizCon in every sense,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, for, for a lot of the sense,
like, you know, Lance and their head of
[SPEAKER_05]: sales, Haley and certainly our CFO,
Dan and Tommy where to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whatnot to a large degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I'm still on the floor
every morning for like a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm out there with the team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm getting up when they are like,
I'm out there with a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want, you know, want them to see me
working in every sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, you can't ask people to
do shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not willing to do like,
you can't not clean toilets.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a boss, you become the janitor too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've accepted that and I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that stuff, maybe not cleaning the
toilets, but you know, doing anything and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, whatever I have to do to
support my team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody misses a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can come in and fucking love the sock
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like part of owning a business is yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loving the shitty days as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go for a shitty day and doing this
and, you know, and I've had some really
[SPEAKER_05]: lucky days than the best days I've had
doing all the things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the easiest, but definitely the most
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure in your travels too, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were like, you know, because I never
pushed on people to ask what I do or what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in town for and tell them and service
the cannabis community and tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: history and like, man, you must love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I do love it, but it's some of
the hardest work I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's crazy, but that's what
makes it so rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people like a question,
these are cliche podcast questions like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, what would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what would you tell someone wants to
get in the business?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people in this industry tell them
to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know if you're passionate,
if you're just a passionate person,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to be passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did an internal audit when I was at
Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had about 400 employees at the time and
just did a fun survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an internal survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: 34% of those individuals did not consume,
which is totally fine, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were passionate about customer
service or passionate about web dev or
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about branding, whatever the
case may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a bunch of consumers and
several growers, but it's a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think culture is just like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fluid, you know, living thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something we're always,
you know, aspiring for.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I, you know, I, I wish I,
you know, when I was what, 24,
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I knew everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew how I had the perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I knew everything when I was 24.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think back about some stuff and I'm just
like, man, how did my, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some good people around me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know what hit me in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely did.
[SPEAKER_02]: My jaw is still crooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's, it's interesting growing
up and then evolving and getting older,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're passionate and you want to
be in cannabis, there's a space for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not winner takes all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, you can create something people
love and create a sustainable business.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are great companies in this space
that have eight employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are great companies in this space
that have 800 employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, a lot of the guys on the
eight range, you know, feel a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the guys in the 800 range and,
you know, I'm sure vice versa to a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: degree, but there's a, there's so much
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you were, we talked about,
you know, some heavy hitters in the space
[SPEAKER_05]: and some revered names.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people like that in every market
whose names we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people putting out world-class
gold tier product in every market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, certainly we're in one of the
epicenters and the heartbeat, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: being, being here and James law facility
and also being in the fucking Bay,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, they're, they're hitters,
you know, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of opportunity, a lot of
like the, there's so much opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the restaurant business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta, you gotta come correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only good as your last seed or your
last jar or your last bag bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's so much truth to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can have that hard work ethic
with a bunch of passion, you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, and again, it's a story I
tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy, he was in the military active,
had definitely some top level clearance at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Pentagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Told me his whole story, reached out on
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he's passionate about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can't consume because of obviously his
career and the choices he made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said, as soon as he got his
honorable discharge, he's going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reached out to me a couple of years
later and he's managing an operation down
[SPEAKER_01]: in Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'm so happy for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never consumed the plant because of his
career at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made the successful transition and
people had asked your point, like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never worked in an industry where
there's so much opportunity when you look
[SPEAKER_01]: HR sales, marketing, pharmaceutical,
logistics, securities, geneticists,
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so much need in this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost trivial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for someone to go like, I'm passionate
about the plant, but I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, there's plenty of options for
you to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you gotta start small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are like,
I want to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, dude, learn how to grow the
plant first, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, there's levels to this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, it's just like in the
culinary world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I think there's a good,
because you can start out as a dishwasher
[SPEAKER_02]: or a water boiling cannabis and end up
being a big, big time seed breeder or
[SPEAKER_02]: being a big time cultivator or have a
product where along the way you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, I want to make a bag that's better
than all the other bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think, you know, we live in
America and it's the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we, there still is the American
dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of people are like,
oh, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the American dream is still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to fight for it and you got to
want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think persistence pays off so huge,
especially in the market that we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's not as easy as it was in
the fifties for the American dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you can still get it for the
California dream, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does still exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, and it's unfortunate is
with the younger generations because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've almost kind of been brainwashed on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy and it fingers lengthen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can DJ because I've got this kid or
I can be an influencer because I know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to break dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey, we all break dance when we were
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is like, nothing's easy and
all these shortcuts and all these hacks
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone's putting focus on the most
successful, still it's hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few people that handed their
first million in a Warren Buffett.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a phenomenal example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a Steve jobs is a great
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Gates is a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's enough individuals that are
in our lifetime, not from the industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: revolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just show up, like genuinely that's half
the job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genuinely, genuinely try to do the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like try to create value with the way you
do business and don't be a fucking douche
[SPEAKER_05]: bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like 90% of it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 90%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Chad's and Brad's or Karen's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those people get weeded out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they may have, some of them have,
and some of them still need to get weeded
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but you remember back in 2018,
man, there's a lot, like when the funny
[SPEAKER_01]: money started moving out of it,
like a lot of those guys that I'm a master
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, wait, you're Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lincoln says you're a yoga instructor last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help me understand how you're a master
grower in industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been consuming since I was this
age.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it on stage one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I've been going to a bathroom
since I'm a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make me a urologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean I know everything going
on, man, just because I'm associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, these things, you know,
we have this instability in the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think over time changes,
we develop a more stable market,
[SPEAKER_02]: more stable with genetics, less companies
for the better in some ways, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways it can be sad, but I think,
you know, we weed out the bad growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys aren't going to be around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think most of those guys aren't
around anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of those guys are not around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't realize the base level
operator of a lot of growers right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: like is much higher than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: The average is very hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three years ago, the average is much
higher and I'm talking globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then beyond that, oh my God,
like nobody wants to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This MSOs are hiring, you know,
the right people are hiring the right
[SPEAKER_05]: chefs and they're figuring out how to put
together replicatable, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: good menus across, across geographic
footprints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, same way Darden restaurant group
has.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, nobody wants to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some stuff coming out of some of
these MSO facilities that they've put
[SPEAKER_05]: together a good playbook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these MSOs are, you know,
starting to be cashflow positive,
[SPEAKER_05]: pay down debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm seeing guys grow at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are seeing these guys that grow
at scale that are creating a better
[SPEAKER_02]: product with a thousand lights than some
of these guys with a hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, some nobody wants to
talk about is how much of it is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be like, you know, nicotine industry
where, you know, you've got really
[SPEAKER_05]: bastardized, you know, infused flavored
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're seeing a lot of,
you know, botanical terpenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, cannabis terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had a huge discussion on terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a lot of infusions,
seeing a lot of stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: coated, dusted, you know, mix and people
like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's going to be a big part of
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Infused, infused flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like confused flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is confused.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do a, you know, the vapor infusion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same way they do in tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people are familiar with some of
the Drew Estate cigars, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: acid cigars.
[SPEAKER_05]: They even have, even around their
marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They and their marketing thing they'll
have explicitly talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonathan Drew is a great entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a brand builder and value,
value creator and dude makes some good
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking cigars.
[SPEAKER_05]: People who like cigars like his cigars,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's selling cigars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a good company, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're talking about, well,
they don't refer to the Drew Estate brand
[SPEAKER_05]: as flavored.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't use the F word.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not flavored.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's infused, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like we're doing the, you know,
with these, these hemp packs and infusions
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, yeah, I think that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing stuff in rec that's infused.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing, you know, I think there's
some of these brands that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing that and to smoke it through a
backwards where it still tastes good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, you can, you know,
this, this bubble gum cannabis and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just, you know, it's just like,
that's just like, I, that is like a,
[SPEAKER_05]: that is a, there was no way that's a
naturally occurring terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I know too much about flavorings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not, there's not a terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bubble gum, I've seen bubble gum terps
that are bubble gum expressions that are
[SPEAKER_02]: very, like the real bubble gum,
if you get to plant the Indiana or
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever you want to say it's from,
I mean, there's a big argument over that
[SPEAKER_02]: forever, but that bubble gum, it
definitely smells bubble gum on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go smoke it, you don't get
the translation of the bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have smoked bubble gum flavored
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, in fact, we have one right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Billionaire bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to get some for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an expression of plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel qualified in, you know,
I, I'm not going to go out here and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, you know, like, you know,
Ryan from Doja's, you know, a pallet or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that that's someone we all agree
inside and out, you know, no smoke,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I know that terp, at least and telling
you it's had an artificial character to
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't, I hope there's not a
future for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too much of yours, but then again,
I don't spool it tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate on anybody for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to do it and there's a
market for it, good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, whatever, like I'm too busy to
worry about what other people are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, and as a breeder, I want to be
breeding those new cultivars and those new
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties where you're like, wow,
that's something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that checks the boxes for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I introduce some, something new that
nobody's ever tried before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or bringing the old with the new,
which is what I love that you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that you're doing more of.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's the conversation going to switch
from, from Z terps and Z cross?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm as guilty as anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been smoking a lot of a candy camera
right now and candy, candy fumes leaning
[SPEAKER_02]: more towards the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it still is candy, but they're like,
I want gas with my candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it doesn't have to be dark purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're okay with like a little bit of
purple in there, but we still want that
[SPEAKER_02]: purple for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that people think it gives it's
the, the bag appeal of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Instagram and social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want real purple, get the real
purple, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Instagram has shifted our perception of
what good cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to fit in the jar, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be three to five nogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always little qualifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew up where the, the worst looking
weed was the very best weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally it did not look good,
but it's smoked amazing, tasted crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effect was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we, we had, that was our focus in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, man, it looked like swag in a
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was, we had some purple
stuff that came from up North that was
[SPEAKER_02]: like pretend to go right where you smoked
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it would check the boxes for bag
appeal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you smoked it, it was like,
man, this is like fucking CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like before CBD was a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in today's market, that stuff would
probably sell because of the way it
[SPEAKER_02]: looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is, there is a market for the
effect and there, you know, it has to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to give you a certain effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't give you any effect,
it's kind of like, I think there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the consumers today are kind of
spoiled to be candid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it might be a little, again,
a little provocative to say, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: to your point, we had to sacrifice a lot
in the eighties and nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talk to someone like Kevin Jodry,
you know, who talks about how the war on
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs, Darrell Gates perpetuated by Nancy
Reagan war on drugs that we grew up with
[SPEAKER_01]: in the eighties, that a hundred percent
took a lot of the Terps out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: equation because all of a sudden the guys
weren't just having to hide on our canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're having to hide the smell,
the scent up on the hill, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that all of a sudden
just drove this pivotal shift into more
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative cultivars that weren't nearly
as gassy or as spicy as what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that did affect the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to your point, I remember Northern
Lights, in my opinion, looked gorgeous,
[SPEAKER_01]: looked fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of people that didn't
have the same opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it was too green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it was too funky,
is too round, too fluffy a bud compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to, again, your Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or your AK, whatever it was that was
popping up at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting how,
to your point, IG is, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: over-manicuring, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you and I both rough cut,
man, the amount of over-manicuring that
[SPEAKER_01]: still happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do kind of blame that more on the
SoCal indoor scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's excessive, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar leaves need love, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they've got terpenes, they've got
trichomes, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I grew up in all my personal,
when I would grow, we'd go in jars and
[SPEAKER_02]: basically we would leave the sugar leaves
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finger trim them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was still doing that in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I both, I know I've seen yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people question, I'm like,
I love rough cutting, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need, like, what am I going to
do, turn it into edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still smokable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff we were seeing today was so
super frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if it's some sort of
cookies cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff was super frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been seeing a lot of cookies crosses
coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of hoping that we get more
cookies coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cookies is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, other than the fact that it has a
bunch of herms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not herming the fuck out in your
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why so many things herm now is
because they all have a lot of cookies in
[SPEAKER_02]: them and that intersects trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been stabilized a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been totally stabilized more,
but there is still a whole bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: to herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even some of the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Mike from Exotic basically
changed my opinion on the whole herm,
[SPEAKER_02]: intersex expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, he had told me because I
was complaining about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, dude, like,
and then I was complaining because some
[SPEAKER_02]: people complain about my stuff having
intersex expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried, that used to be my main thing
is I don't want any intersex expressions
[SPEAKER_02]: in any of my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it has intersex.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you miss what, and what Mike to
his point was that then you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: miss out on terps potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stuff that I have,
I definitely put it on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually, we put it on the,
like, if you look in the description on
[SPEAKER_02]: our website, there's stuff that I will
tell people it has intersex traits,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm not going to prevent people from
germinating those seeds and trying those
[SPEAKER_02]: things because it has, I mean,
if you want to try them, I think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: some amazing terps that you get out of
some stuff that has intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time we can get rid of the
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now with, with some of the data
that we have and with the sequencing,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've already identified potential
markers to be able to get rid of intersex
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew resistance, all these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more into the technology side.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see that naturally in different
landraces, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason landraces are prevalent in
different areas is, you know, often,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you have terpian profiles and
bud structures that are more in depth to
[SPEAKER_05]: the, realize the environment there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A Durban is very, very good for an arid,
you know, South African environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas, you know, Golden Buddha is very
multigious in, you know, the way it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: way those, you know, bigger colas are more
humidity resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those, those less dense colas are less
spongy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it leads to that open bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff with the really open bud
structure does a lot better typically in
[SPEAKER_02]: humid environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why these equatorial varieties and
these tropical varieties with open bud
[SPEAKER_02]: structure do so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a pineapple chunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the old stuff's come back,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of sardines getting bred back in,
blue diamond, like you're hearing some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they can be, so like when they
started going with the extraction,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean, they were doing the GMO
and it was dumping and then the Donnie
[SPEAKER_02]: burgers and all those double burgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like GMOs of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little baffled on why they went so
hard towards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you can really stress it and get it
to dump.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it to dump heavy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a heavy dumper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like the Donnie burger,
I don't like the Donnie burger flour so
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not my choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I, I won't smoke the rest of a
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody gives me some flora and flame,
shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when he turned it into extracts and I
got to try the Donnie burger, he gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: two grams or three grams of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought him, Oh, this is a reggae.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were reggae on the river together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the Donnie burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking it with the little dipper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were trying that flora flame and
that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the effect and it's super smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this little floral hint and it has
the sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is different than GMO, but I could
taste the GMO in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I'm surprised to have more
time in the limelight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you, like there's a,
there was a few over the years and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone beats up runs and Skittles,
you know, cause they definitely got
[SPEAKER_01]: played.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, there's some like GMO where I'm
like, what's up or even like coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like garlic funk rank dank, you know,
GMO Terp, but it's such an overwhelming
[SPEAKER_05]: terp profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as easy to play with as a
Skittles that kind of dug its way with
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much easier to mix and match that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I love the papayas they're
doing with X jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these, these wild ones,
it's like, uh, you know, but I still love
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you give me a good Skittles rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sweet to the nose, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is tough to your point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's an all around winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, again, I think I got played
a little bit on flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there again, there was just,
there was such great, man, the 2010s,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially like I respect the 2000,
but the 2010 so much stuff that really got
[SPEAKER_01]: some serious play versus just,
I feel like it's been cycled so quick in
[SPEAKER_01]: and out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I bet you it will be back here in five
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I'll be talking about like,
man, like what I would pay for like a
[SPEAKER_05]: primo tops, you know, uh, fucking,
you know, pack of, you know, like think
[SPEAKER_05]: line ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been loving his Skittles flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trends and the directions they go in
and kind of Skittles keeps coming back
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen where it goes away for a little
bit, then comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're talking about the pack
prices being super high for Skittles,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, again, which was like a meme,
dude, it was a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want to grow it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't want to grow Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my friends go and we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how about GDP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's bring GDP back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's bring, let's bring Urkel back.
[SPEAKER_02]: GDP is a tough one to bring back just
cause it's a pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people don't want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow Swain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, but I don't have the patience for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I just, I don't, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we got some cubits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of TC that's coming down really
soon, we got some chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the 91 chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some chem D we've got star
killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got pretty good about Cuban black
haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from rare darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did some, I've done breeding with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super, it's got this gassy amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a Southern, that's a Southern Ohio
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one is super special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, if you, if you know it,
you know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you smell it again, you're like,
that's star killer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so distinct if you have powerful
medical indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a powerful medical and it's a great
way to put it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not, I have not seen a great
execution of what I feel like in over 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years up in Washington, can organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the cut from me and we didn't
tell anybody it was star killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even tell them it was star killer
for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff where I'm like, well,
we got to come up with another name
[SPEAKER_02]: because I can't tell you the name of it
because I can't give it out because I
[SPEAKER_02]: promised the person I gave it to that I
wouldn't give it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those guys can organics and I have
a really good relationship long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really good guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really good guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done breeding work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an organic product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love a handful of brands in
Washington, but they are one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Tim is the one who I get
silver from for my reversals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I work real closely with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done breeding projects together for
other companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Props to PNW, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's again, not to, but like,
just like Jamaica and Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I see these guys growing outdoor and
I'm like, props to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, man, for dealing with this,
Mother Nature has given you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to do some seed production in
Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where all the good grows are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the Eastern side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy, Andrew Jones, he's doing some
amazing stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he did it this year and I got FOMO
and I'm like, let's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think we're going to be
bringing loud seeds and partnering with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, with Andrew out there and doing some
really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's another guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I met him and he introduced me to Tim
from Kano Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Andrew and I have been really tight and
done some really cool stuff in Fallbrook.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were working down in Fallbrook
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, he had a farm, a hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, it's, it's funny how small
the world is and how the guy, everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: works together at the top, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of collaboration going on
and not as much hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause most of the smart ones do what you
talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the bad apples got, we kind of
pushed out of the bunch, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially I think in the mid late teens
up till now, like it's kind of strongest.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll surge back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen that happen too.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get back in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you're like a bad penny.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly do you say that you do for
this community?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, I've seen people make
mistakes and I've seen people come back a
[SPEAKER_02]: better person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people make some silly mistakes
and come back in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apologize about it, which I've been
very, there's a few that have been like,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, it was a douche.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know, you figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had you're coming to Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're talking about the same
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small world, small world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how that works out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but this is such a community and
we're very tight knit and everybody kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone knows all the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you burn people, especially it
gets passed around real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody's businessman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I tell people again,
speaking up on stage, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is very unique because every industry
start out as a community rather be real
[SPEAKER_01]: estate, automotive, banking, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All start out as a community of
individuals that are trying to solve a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like you guys, like we can bring a
solution, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is this is still
being led by the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a corporate one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a private industry, if you will,
especially not on the global scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's 53 legal countries around
the world and a lot of Americans don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go to places like Thailand or
Australia or Argentina or wherever we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going around the world, like it's
interesting because they take a different
[SPEAKER_01]: approach towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them can balance that
community and corporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can, we're here for the right
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our heart in the right place,
but we want to do it very professionally
[SPEAKER_01]: and very structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes back to the SOPs and all these
other standards, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it's definitely, we've seen a lot
in our time, I'd say, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only thing constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got one question that I ask all my
guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have one piece of advice for your
younger self or your younger colleagues.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, everybody's in such a rush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are in such a rush and like the
beauty and the best stuff is not at,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, DJ's companies, you know,
mansion party or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done in the labs, done in the grouse,
done in the shops, done in the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done late at night.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's done with, you know,
it's done with your core people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, don't don't rush that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't don't rush the people are so keen to
rush the magic and rush the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're so focused on like,
you know, like the the the fruits of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and the the benefits,
the journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think the people make it and do
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're interested in the journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're interested in the relationships
they're going to make during the journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're interested in what they're going
to learn about themselves during the
[SPEAKER_05]: journey, what they're learning about the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think, you know, you got to
you got to be able to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: pick up that, pick up your phone like,
you know, in the lab, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing, you know, in the warehouse,
you know, it could be, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: your your shitty little building,
you know, in Cleveland, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, across the street from the from
the biggest men's shelter in the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you got to be able to pick up your
phone and like look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: people going out or, you know,
doing this or front end or all that
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagram bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to be able to put your phone
up and slide that phone back in your
[SPEAKER_05]: pocket or put it back on your desk and
like keep doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's it's the flow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people people try to rush and
avoid the the flow of process,
[SPEAKER_05]: the flow processes when you're flowing in
there with your guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a unique time in life and your team
and your colleagues.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's that's that's such a
unique, beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can do such incredible things
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can propel you for so long,
create social momentum.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people try to try to rush that or skip
that stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an original answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
