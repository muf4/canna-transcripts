[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: My special guests are Don and Aaron from
DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some history.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've known each other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a lot of people that we're,
you know, a lot of small world,
[SPEAKER_01]: small world, mutual friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis cups, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all on the tours together with all
the cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the trenches, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in the trenches together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it before it was cool to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you guys were kind of the first,
you guys were the inspiration more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: for most of the Americans to come over to
Amsterdam and like potentially start a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys were one of the reasons
that we went over as Loud Seeds was
[SPEAKER_02]: because of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys kind of put the footwork down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys kind of showed everybody how it's
done and, you know, really impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to hear your story today from
the beginning of how you guys got into
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, how you got over to Amsterdam,
all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with Don and how you got
involved with cannabis and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I started smoking weed when
I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it was mostly my mom was
smoked a lot of weed and she used it
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinally before there was medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growing up, it was always around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always just, you know, she was
always smoking in the living room and
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really hide it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later, as it progressed into the
medical world and whatever, she was
[SPEAKER_00]: totally not just an advocate, but a
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the thing that helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched how much it helped her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like late 80s, early 90s or
early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you know, it helped her
through a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no way to convince me that
there was something negative connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of the laws based on the
personal experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was she smoking good weed back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she was back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was smoking whatever she can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in the late 80s,
California, in the Riverside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Riverside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she was smoking whatever my dad
was getting at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as we got older and started,
you know, doing things ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: I supported her for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: She passed away, obviously, not obviously,
but she passed away since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always helped her even till she
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, that part of it was I had this
instant connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how I got involved with with Erin was
I moved to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: from Riverside and I didn't know anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so literally, I was dating this girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you have a girlfriend that's
from L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if she knows anybody who can score a
bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to drive an hour and a half
to Riverside right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got no hookups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person that came over to the house
to hook it up was Erin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a dirty ass bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like talking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dirtiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, have you ever seen like if
you try to blow a bubble into oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: watch it pop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'll bubble up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will go slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like La Brea Tar Spitz filled with
just ash and and fucking crud in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking it was nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a reason to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just let's just say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed wasn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, you know, and I was in
this transitional phase where it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like I had all my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think the second time I
came over, I brought a bottle for Formula
[SPEAKER_01]: 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so this had to be like I almost got
it almost good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was like late 90s, 97,
98.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, that was it was like 97,
98 because the only reason why I know it
[SPEAKER_00]: was around that time is because I judged
the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time I'd ever gone
to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my whole thing was, you know,
that was that was legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the everything that everybody was
doing anywhere else was whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Amsterdam was where people were like
pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it was at in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should happen in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you think because,
you know, you're reading high times
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing all the Amsterdam stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, we could crush it over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, well, the flower was on a
different level.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So California is on a different level,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still is still is like, you know,
you have the Spanish weed coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam calling it California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's selling for good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 98, Judge the Cup came back from from
Amsterdam was like, this is the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: best shit ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys go there together?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were solo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went I went solo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and and judged it just to judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't some judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a judge's kit for 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and I went down the coffee shop
crawl and I met all the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't like Don from in the industry
or anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went to experience it like a fan of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Tony from Saga Mothra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember talking to him for for a while
and like that picking his brain and like
[SPEAKER_00]: met Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met, you know, just the people that you
ended up linking up with later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we ended up renting Tony's from Saga
Mothra shop from him years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so when I came back from Amsterdam,
it was like they have a lot of haze and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of really bomb hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these exotic passes I'd never been
able to smoke before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be honest, like we had them with
the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Cali weed was just super
superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just on a level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still is, like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I came back from Amsterdam,
it was like, bro, you know, we could crush
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think I was to to to get us
to to to go back every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I judged every year and I'd go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a couple of times he had a ticket
and ended up didn't not go in and got a
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket and didn't go.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was so Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were several, several times to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just never, never, never panned out
for us to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we ended up going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we we had a you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a friend of ours in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had this job in Denmark to finish a
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wants some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you guys want to help us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to help?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to help me and get out of
the states?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the Twin Towers had come
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was all like fucking the
political thing was all crazy with Bush
[SPEAKER_00]: and this and it was like, you know,
well, let's just get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fuck all the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was a plumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron was a builder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in construction and we both just
quit our jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really such a builder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not but you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, good stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, it was a drop of
everything I owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it and had to vanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I end up working for my buddy,
right, because I wasn't bringing in weed
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I just vanished and I helped him on
construction, doing construction shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: finished jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was staying at his house also,
and I was helping him with his work,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, because I was, you know, in hiding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're in hiding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so let's start it back back a
couple of years before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You started smoking in late 80s,
early 90s, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crushing and good L.A.
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was good L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a period of time where
it was like swaggy weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was good weed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when there was real droughts,
where there was times where it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was just a certain period of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, like the junior high high
school right in that area was like you to
[SPEAKER_01]: find good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was hard to find, you know,
for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we come across it and, you know,
otherwise it would be street weed with
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bama.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a Bama brown weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting my homie a pound of the seeded
weed right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four hundred bucks a pound, which is
cheaper than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to I think it was four hundred
dollars a pound in the 90s when I as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as the stuff that I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there was outdoor in
California that was going for less than
[SPEAKER_02]: four hundred last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and it's not seeded and it's not
brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like might not be that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be sprayed with pesticides,
but it's who knows about what the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: they put in, you know, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get Max in Riverside before I
moved to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would get it for like two fifty a
pound and I'd flip it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was so then because I had I had
the hookups with these other group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were bringing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it was on the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that four hundred price was the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the normal price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was the hookup price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still had seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still had banana or orange peel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would get you high, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that stuff would get you really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give you a headache high sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like and you know,
there was no micro dosing anything back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would smoke and you'd smoke a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get fucking ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the bammer would give you a headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like smoking better stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure was the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste tasted better, smelled better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you look better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then it was green weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was any purple, it would be like,
yeah, I mean, it was rare to see any red
[SPEAKER_00]: hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all completely red hair with no
crystals on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of that stuff was all pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all smashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like you get Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was like that Colombian that we
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of it was Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most of it would be Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was a period where I would get
like tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shit was like narcotic with the
fucking rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was string rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would put you down, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't make like you make some fucking
brownies with that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would it would take people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take people out psychedelic weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so like we I've been around weed since
I was a little kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'd say in junior high,
you know, junior high, you're smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're throwing seeds out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you're you know, the seeds are
germinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your buddies are coming to your window
like, dude, you know, you got a pot plant
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been throwing seeds out the window,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like and then they're coming by
stealing the leaves because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all didn't know shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're but we're all reading high
times looking fucking pictures,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: High times was the way to get excited back
in the day before there was the Internet
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I still have my high times issues
from back when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have much, but I think maybe I
have like one little snippet I took out of
[SPEAKER_01]: a high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to fucking who was humble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was right near us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right across homegrown fantasies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they made this cool advertisement
with the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always remember that, you know,
like and I kept that fucking little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I still have it because
everything was lost in the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: High times went through different stages,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the original stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was all counterculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I have magazines from the 80s that
was like, all coke and ecstasy and all
[SPEAKER_00]: about like there's weed stuff in it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was more just about the
counterculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on this and like kind of like
giving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it went weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it went to like no pictures of
weed, but just like a bunch of articles
[SPEAKER_00]: about stuff nobody wanted to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it went back to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It went through all these weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally went through weird phases and the
cups went through weird phases,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hager phases in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they came to the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the end of the cannabis cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the end of the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think 2012, 2014 were like they
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those were some fun where there was a
bunch of them back to back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like one in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: and San Francisco, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there was the L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the San Francisco one
in 2010 was the first in the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there with Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: when they did the first one in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a step back to when you guys
got over to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did 2003?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we ended up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went over to Europe for this
finishing thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which didn't turn into anything because
the dude that was just bullshitting us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought it was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up in fucking in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a trip in Liège, Belgium.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did we land?
[SPEAKER_01]: France.
[SPEAKER_01]: We landed in Paris and Paris took a train
to Liège.
[SPEAKER_01]: Belgium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were supposed to meet minus 18 outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend at this train station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and the dude flaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had this dude's number and we
called this dude and he came to pick us
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, how do you guys know Dohani?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, how do you know Dohani?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, shut up here, Pave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oncule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wallani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's talk city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Flam.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he picked us up and we started talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, I picked that fool up on
hitchhiking one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we end up staying at this dude's
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew some weed and we had weed to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he took, you know, but like at a
certain point, we're all staying our
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, his girl's like, and it's and
it's like literally it's it's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: coldest winters in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking canals are frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're like, yeah, we're going to go
to Amsterdam and fuck off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went to Amsterdam and we met.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fucked off, but we like we met.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we saw because I had kept
telling him for years about Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were like, we're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're literally a couple hour train ride
to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just we didn't even have a plane
ticket to go home for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just blow our wad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we then change our ticket and go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, that was the plan.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, like just spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're young.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of roll it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we met people and I was like,
dude, so we could be so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we met Bonguru, Jim Spector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not not the not the one that's famous for
another Jim Spector.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's murder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's like a master, like flamenco
fucking guitar player.
[SPEAKER_01]: He fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was with Gypsy Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we're leading into the.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like I see kind of graphic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before you see the seeds.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds direct and overgrown was the
overgrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was the we met them and we were
chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met some we, you know, we got to meet
people, you know, Ro who owned a noon
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we got to meet people in the
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, dude, we can come over
here and and kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went back, you know, six months
later, we made it to our our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We end up getting a job working for the
Flying Pig Hostel just as like helpers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met my wife at the Flying Fucking Pig
Hostel, the one you're still married to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got an apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got an apartment from the from the
Flying Pig because we were like the
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance dudes who were fixing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our girls were, you know, my girl,
Kim, my Kim, my my wife, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were living together in my apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was already supposed to go back home
to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she stayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we met other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our time was up and she stayed
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went back to California and hustled
our asses off so you could move there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sold everything we sold everything
and hustled everything we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wife was my girlfriend at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got back and like, you know,
the money got put together and we got a
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like one of us didn't have we
didn't have two bedrooms, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was, you know, we hustled,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't about like DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about growing fucking some fire
shit that they haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at first we were growing New York City
Diesel because that's what's so much New
[SPEAKER_01]: York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's super loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It burns your nose a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not five or six dollars a gram,
bro, at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's super, you know, super fruity,
super good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't really get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like tangy and all those citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of citrusy ones, unless they're like
hazes, don't get you that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I smoke tangy dabs, bro, I can't
remember shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me stupid, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangy dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like purple punch dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like purple punch flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dabs are all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flour is not what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we moved over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic living soil, strawberry banana is
some of the best flour you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not get you that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't touch the fucking hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just certain strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get back to the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go, you know, we meet Gypsy and
Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hanging out with Bonguru all the
time, you know, and then we move.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come back to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get an apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we start growing some New York City
and Gypsy is like, hey, you guys want to
[SPEAKER_01]: can you do a seed crop for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, OK, well, it's in the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my question about daddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, who's your daddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want us to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'll do a seed crop instead of
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a seed crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, he was going to pay
us for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's going to pay us for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't know about he was going to
we were going to come out with our company
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just about getting us to do a seed
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turned out to be called Who's Your
Daddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like six different males with power
plant females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That he gave out with every single order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like 60,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single order, someone's getting
three, six seeds, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was he was given 10 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever it was, every single person
for like a year was getting these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's your daddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, who's your daddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like it was so.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys still have packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we still have the original,
some original ones that he was given out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the little zipper in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the sticker, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we still have some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was so that was and he's like,
well, you guys have to have a name for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: And our buddy who we met through Soma,
through Soma and Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: His Greek guy named Yorgos and Yorgos
knows what's happening with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was I don't know if he was on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he was on mushrooms, but he was
like, came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I got the perfect name for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I got the logo and then he
comes out and he's like DNA with the font
[SPEAKER_01]: and the logo with the seeds, the double
helix with the seeds in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was our original logo that went
out on every single freebie pack that
[SPEAKER_01]: went.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a lawsuit next week from
Yorgos's company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, oh, you admitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got paid for that logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like our first seed catalog was
made by our buddy, Brian, who was the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when his two buddies, you know,
and then got bought out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and got a bunch of, you know, like,
dude, like it was an interesting time when
[SPEAKER_01]: we came out into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very interesting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't the first Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there was Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's American Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma was American.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Dunn was American.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and, and JJ from advanced nutrients
was American and he brought like the
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he brought the bubble gum or
Northern lights or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to meet all these dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we, we did the seed crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that seed crop,
we're growing weed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, then we started making our
seeds, you know, like, and started mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali with Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cali with that was your thing is
bringing the American style genetics over
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cause nobody had like in Europe,
nobody knew what OG Kush was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we come over with this whole like,
oh, gee, oh, gee, and then you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: no, gee, it's all haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You walk into the damp cream and they're
selling OJ Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you spelled it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my belief on what happened over in
Amsterdam with OG Kush is people brought
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts over.
[SPEAKER_02]: People brought some seeds over whatever,
but what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was in the selection
process, when they did crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: they selected for vigor and they yield and
vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And OG Kush doesn't, yeah, they went away
from the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam, THC's had OG, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They had OG, why we had OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG got screwed up for years because of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their OG was MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was OG crossed G13 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His MK Ultra was legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a legit, but it wasn't like the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't like the pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was califier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there wasn't gassy stuff for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even during the OG phases over
here, there wasn't a lot of good OG,
[SPEAKER_02]: even when I was there in 2012.
We had to bring Cali, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to bring Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wanted people to be able to
buy seeds and then get Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: First smoke the weed and then buy the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the Cali experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, bro, all those years I told
you that I was going to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd come back with seeds and you'd grow
the seeds and it wasn't what was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never one time did you get anything that
was better than what you were smoking at
[SPEAKER_00]: home, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like, wait a minute,
that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did all this shit involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end you don't have
anything that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to be the one selling
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give them something where
they can buy one pack and get what's on
[SPEAKER_00]: the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: First go buy the weed at the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was numero uno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go buy the weed and then they're going to
come, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to see the weed and they'll
be like, I want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there seeds of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go see, go see the, you know,
the DNA boys, you know, and when they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would come, come over to our shop and
they'd be like, should you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolobe seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, what the fuck is chocolobe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, what do you mean chocolobe?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is chocolobe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, we were just at the gray area
and we got some of this weed that they
[SPEAKER_01]: call chocolobe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, oh, that's the D line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always one of my questions was how
the D line turned into chocolobe,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: He couldn't sell it as D line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd put it on the menu as D line and
nobody would fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as he called it chocolobe,
everybody wanted to fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wants chocolobe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, I crossed the chocolobe
to the banana Skittles and I did a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: other crosses, but I want to give you guys
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be some amazing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, I think, you know,
do a co-release on that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the chocolobe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different than all the fruity stuff now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think all that stuff that we
were smoking 12 years ago is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this fruity, purpley stage that
we're in, dessert, or they want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic, but there's nothing exotic about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some like some haze, some fucking
South Africans, some Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's exotic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you didn't go to some exotic place to
create the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say it's just a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of hype behind a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but I think it's all about having
variety, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a little bit of everything
because everybody, you know, food,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like food, it's so subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you like to drink, what you like to
eat, what you like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that super sober haze I just
smoked was more exotic than some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: like rents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just like rare exotic and exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely exotic compared to the
fruity ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just like food, everyone can make
spaghetti, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can make spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in a can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in a can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to sell you, if you don't know
how to make some spaghetti, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell you the ingredients in this bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is spray it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone's a spaghetti maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they can make spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we watched the bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We watched Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inflode almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, we got our European medical cards
just so we could bring our own weed to
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were living in Amsterdam,
because like Spain's weed suck,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, you didn't want to
touch anybody who was trying to hand you a
[SPEAKER_01]: nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for like a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a very few people in Spain,
like five people.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was Soma's weed back in the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, when you guys first got
over this, the grapefruit and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those did like there was the Soma A+,
which was the rock bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one that we saw in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw it in Europe, but in the
States, that was some fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the seed that he put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw it in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Buddha's sister in Europe and
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel was the big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be honest, like, I didn't smoke a
lot of weed that Soma grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the stuff on his balcony on the
summer stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I smoked a lot of stuff that he
oversaw maybe, or like guided the people
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be anything negative,
but I think it's more acquired stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he had his, he knew the good growers
that could grow his strains good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it was 10 years ago and I could
just be passing out all these varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, yo, just bring them back to me,
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll, I'll distribute them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those still, it's the legal days
is just have a distribution license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you guys start winning cups?
[SPEAKER_01]: 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2004 till now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have amassed a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: LA Confidential was our, it was third
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So LA Confidential was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember growing that back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had like more, the one we had had
like orange, really bright orange hairs
[SPEAKER_02]: that it grew with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stacked really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get full colas and it was gassy,
but it was unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like the cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was earthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super earthy.
Copy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strange, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very strange, but really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would burn down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there wasn't a lot of stuff at that
time that you could smoke a whole joint
[SPEAKER_02]: of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You burn it down to the roach and you're
like, oh, I could fire that roach up the
[SPEAKER_02]: next day and it's going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that the first day we got our shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked an LA Confidential joint in our
shop and we went home and we get a call
[SPEAKER_01]: from our neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The police are breaking into your shop
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying hemp plantage, hemp
plantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally we don't have anything in
this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got the keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were cresting in the place of the
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they fucking break into the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, like we didn't even.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were unpacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even open.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they felt kind of like, you know,
they're calling like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your seeds are at the police station and
your keys are at the police station.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rekeyed our shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that night though, the fucking the
police officers on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, bro, don't don't break in the
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no there's no hemp plantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor's telling him there's no hemp
plantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall back for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's telling me on the phone that he
just fucked up my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And broke into our shop and didn't find
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, dummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you don't know the
difference between the smell of a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: and a growing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they got a phone call and they're
like, we got to go in there and deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the one that had to go to the police
station.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yo, I was like, can I get
the keys to our shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we already had the locksmith
changing the locks and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, you know, it sucks for you
that we broke into your shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it was a call because it was a
hemp plantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, we just smoked a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, is it illegal to smoke a joint in
your shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no, it just sucks that you,
you know, it sucks for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, so it's not illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, he goes, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, so it's OK for me to smoke a
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, so if you ever get a call about weed
smell coming from my shop, please don't
[SPEAKER_01]: break in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please call.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing anything illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our shop, you know, and we never had
a problem ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our street, our street is a third away
between like a really big shopping street
[SPEAKER_00]: and the police station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they're always walking down our
street like and they literally get to our
[SPEAKER_01]: our window and just like look like,
dude, like because we were chief and like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in our shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we're not in the grow room,
we're in the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even if we one of us is in the grow
room, one of us is in the shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was cool back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you go to the coffee shop and smoke the
weed, you'd ask them where you can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd tell you where and if it was,
let's say, chocolate or L.A., they'd come
[SPEAKER_00]: to our shop and then we'd show them a
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time we had the weed of
what we were selling the seeds of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea would be smoke it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a bond load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was so cool to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a store as an American in Europe
and then you see other tourists coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: from wherever they're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And giving them bond loads right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was just it was a different
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure I'm like, we still I was just
there last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I was smoking joints in the
back of the shop, but not in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just different,
just different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year will be our 20 year anniversary
of having a store in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we're not going nowhere,
even though it should change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could smoke 24 seven in our
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't changed the law like they
have in the red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smoke in the red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same dude that called when we first
smoked the joint 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helped us get insurance because we had to
get this special insurance because wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: us to stay because we've been there 20
years next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and he basically had our back and
wrote a letter to the owner and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things because we've been such
good tenants because in 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we literally don't like we don't bother
anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might smell like weed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put in the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we know we we've improved the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have like a fucking thousand
gallon fish tank with fucking fire eels
[SPEAKER_01]: that we got that were like babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're fucking so big that
they're dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like fucking softball size,
fucking bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like it's it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, now we're back over here
and we're still doing Europe thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, you guys still got the Europe
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were working with Crockett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were partnering with Crockett for
a while doing this stuff and going on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cup circuit with Crockett, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was always fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone always had good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the you know, those are the
circuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sell selling seeds, you know,
DNA by Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was DNA by Crockett DNA by Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a long time before that was DNA,
but that didn't that stopped really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now it's just full on because now
it's full on like seeds are legal seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you still have your shop in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys still sell seeds in Amsterdam and
clothing hats.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to make new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, your stuff is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we're putting out some
new hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bringing back some old and like
we have a chocolate crop that we're about
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish seed crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, you know, strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bringing cantaloupe haze back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original cantaloupe haze is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slee stacks coming back, you know,
and all you kids don't even know Slee
[SPEAKER_00]: stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motherfuckers like three time legends of
hash winter in Amsterdam before it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like 700 bucks a dinner, which is well
worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking smack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like 30 people that got
to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was different, but super invitational,
super invitational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring that smoke in that crazy hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's cool that like the crazy hash
bowls evolved to what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy hash bowls like be glad you have
Coca-Cola around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep you alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hubbly bubbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time only, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Amsterdam is, you know, a great
place, you know, and California's has
[SPEAKER_01]: proven to be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it was, you know, since they've
changed the laws and stuff like very
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you guys have gone through
your challenges, you know, as you've
[SPEAKER_02]: scaled because you guys have scaled as far
as seed companies in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys have scaled the most more
than anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys have went through the most
phases, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think difficult times,
great times, first challenges,
[SPEAKER_01]: first seed company to do a major licensing
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were with Canopy up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a big deal for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a lot of shit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody that we took shit from
are all in like a legal play in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody has to do it first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone has, you know, and yeah,
there was Adam Dunn and TH Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing his thing over there,
but you guys were kind of the big guys
[SPEAKER_02]: from California, really freaking hitting
it hard over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had their hoodlum thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their hoodlum thing was, you know,
I had a hoodlum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Him and Doug with the coat, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hoodlum coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavy, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that'll last for the rest of my life
as long as I don't get any bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It barely fits now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember his wife come into work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rain wearing a hoodlum coat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, dude, that thing is like
so heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll protect you from that weather in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Arctic weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That January, that cold December and
January.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes you walk fast though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes you ride your bike fast,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do a collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Don, down with you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all about that new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All about the new shit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like constantly finding new
flavors that fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the market will stabilize and then
there won't be the need for all these new
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy genetics as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people see an easy lane and they
try to just jump in it, whether it be like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody became a DJ in the nineties or
everybody, you know, is now on this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everybody's thinking they can make
quick money being a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost better for companies like
ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of lets the fat rise to the top
without making a fat joke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your history?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you done?
[SPEAKER_00]: What quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just pollen chucking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just making seeds of a bunch of
other people's gears?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see you on Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you haven't and you just make
it, that's also good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's young breeders that are doing
great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's guys that are up in the hills
that have been doing it longer than we
[SPEAKER_01]: have that don't put their name out there
that have created some legendary shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and like, yeah, like it's not,
you could be, it's, you could do a quick,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the quick business, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now it's the cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just reclassified seeds as seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no TTC on them so that
you could send them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some places might stop it and,
but yeah, I mean, there's phytosanitary
[SPEAKER_02]: issues, all that, but that that's all
changing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, you know, you can send,
you can send hemp seeds anywhere with
[SPEAKER_02]: phytosanitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a phytosanitary certificate and
sent seeds legally from Holland to Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: for the canopy deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it was a thing, like before you
could even do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a good one is we were trying
to get our phytosanitary in Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_00]: we couldn't, we couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all came down to, we had a guy
working for us that ran everything for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's, who was like our brother who was
really linear, really did things by the
[SPEAKER_00]: book and really was just like what me and
Aaron needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed someone to keep us kind of on,
on the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he got, he got to the point where
the phytosanitary certificate in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it, you had to provide a country of
origin for the seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't do that in Amsterdam with the
Netherlands, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't at the time there was no legal
place on the planet to buy seeds to obtain
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the person at the office of the
phytosanitary in the Netherlands kept
[SPEAKER_00]: telling him in a nice way, like just
fucking fill it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just whatever, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's so linear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's so just by the book and he's,
he didn't get it to the point where dude
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, listen, if you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, cause our guy was like,
I'll come to your office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't understand why this isn't
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, okay, meet me here at this
time at Bova.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows up and it's a McDonald's parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and Pedro's like, like what,
you know, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, did you bring money?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, I go, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's, it's a, it's a classic payoff,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude just wants you to fucking pay him
off, you know, something like whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, just be ready for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it was minus the payoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude didn't want any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just wanted to meet him to tell him,
look, bro, you don't have to be all like
[SPEAKER_00]: wily about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fill it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the one to stamp it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he knows also there was no way for
him to like, there's, it was like a catch
[SPEAKER_00]: 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the rules to where like you had to show
up, come to your origin, but you either
[SPEAKER_00]: dry smidge on yourself, which you can't do
because you can't make the seed yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no legal function to buy
them for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy them from all these different
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time we needed this paperwork to
be able to do the deal with canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got it at a parking lot in
McDonald's.
Wow.
Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so let's talk about Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause Tangy had its rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Tangy was on top for a good
three, four years where it was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it actually OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take it even further back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about OG 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was kind of pre Tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like salary OG, like Kemi
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I guess it was a hit with
growers, you know, all across the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you then that was like the OG
era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was big in Amsterdam too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get OG, OG 18 flower, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was a period where you could
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want an OG more than likely you
were getting OG 18, even if it was called
[SPEAKER_02]: something else, you know, a lot of times
sour diesel was, you know, like over in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam, I saw that totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like, and then, uh,
we had met Crockett Dave in, in right
[SPEAKER_01]: around that, that period of OG 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were going back and forth from
California to Amsterdam, but Dawn and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we, um, they've like, we met them
through a Mark Haskell Smith who wrote a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of books and included us in his
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was writing about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he met Crockett on the plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it all came together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so Crockett's like, Hey,
I got something I want to give to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see you up in San Francisco,
I think we were selling, selling shirts
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with Addison up there at the Rosie,
the Riveter factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking, I remember that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so, he's like here,
you know, and I'm like, and I had my boy
[SPEAKER_01]: Sergio with me and we were in 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were both bicycle messengers,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Slinging weed in downtown Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some weed came into town.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was called tangerine dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nose on it, the high was okay,
but the nose was, it was like Calio,
[SPEAKER_01]: but on steroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I remember Calio pre predating,
but that was like a 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weaker or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a long flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Calio's that were short flowering
that you squeeze them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell tangy, but then it goes to like
old nasty and like nothingness,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the real Calio's smoked like
tangy down to the road where it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: that full, like the one that we got in the
bay, the flavor, it was a flavor all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, yeah, this guy,
Sean Alberts used to grow the fucking most
[SPEAKER_02]: of, he used to either grow it or get it,
but it was just, you know, that next level
[SPEAKER_02]: Calio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when he gave it, he gave it to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, I'm going to blow this
shit out of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started growing it and then we
started extracting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting, I was getting all the tangy
weed that was coming around like just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like back in the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was, some of it was going to
extraction and like the first dude doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the extraction was like this dude,
Buddha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all like bubble back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this was fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shit, the loudest shit and it
fucking just, and he wasn't about the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was still a little bit about
the flower, but it was more about the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like in Europe, it was about the
flower and in America, it's dabs time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you take, and this is like 2008,
maybe 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something around back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had BHO before them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wheezy Dabs was around back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like all that shit,
like Tangy was just taking over everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crushing everything, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, to the point where we like,
we branded it as, you know, as Crockett's
[SPEAKER_01]: cut, you know, Tangy Crockett's cut and
created a brand around it, which turned
[SPEAKER_01]: out to be Crockett Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that's how Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won everything for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how Dave got into the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was, there was like the
popularity of it aspect to where people
[SPEAKER_02]: judging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, it stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stands out cause it stands out against
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like there's not only the fact that
it's good weed grown properly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So super unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Martian won in 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going against all these other things
that are almost the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, like you said, Martian,
Martian Mean Green, that's another one
[SPEAKER_01]: that we should bring back and go,
go hunting through the seeds, the original
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, but like the wow factor,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, you walk into a room,
and everything is kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like, there's one that's
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you smoke it and it like
hits you with the hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that was the Martian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, that hazy earlier
flowering haziness, you know, nine week,
[SPEAKER_01]: just be like dark green, like straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see that shit in hash
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, yeah, there's a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were taking hot knives of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love hot knives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, I swear we're going to start
doing hot knives again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a topic of discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just used to take my parents knives and
heat them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a custom made thing made for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a bong with a percolator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put water in it with an open bottom,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stick the knife in after you press
them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two glass rods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have the little camping burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you press them together,
you had this bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this massive smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just use the cardboard tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd roll up a magazine or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper towel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so fucked up with that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, got the bong on 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a hit and curled up in the fucking
corner of the couch in the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: All fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the police are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned Wheezy's name a couple
minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheezy Dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheezy Dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you guys remember the backstage at
Slightly Stupid in maybe 2000?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the most smoked out I've ever seen
any backstage, but we were in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was slightly stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheezy was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crockett was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a who's who of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a bunch of other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were definitely there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Serge, my buddy Serge, wearing his
Dodger shit in Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Serge got fucking thumped,
bro, in the pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember he lost his glasses,
his Dodger hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't need to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just inhale the air and blow
smoke out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the most smoked out I've ever seen
any backstage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fucking fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun one, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry's changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely evolved, but everything
evolves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disco evolves into what disco evolved
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like OGs of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not fly by nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're still around and it's tough
enough just to be around, but a lot of OGs
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't around anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at all the people that started
and also partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are not the only partners left,
but some of the, out of all the partner
[SPEAKER_02]: groups, you look at THC, you look at me,
you look at a lot of other guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Doug and Adam are still on good terms
or whatever, but a lot of guys just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of went their own ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to work with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to work with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of those were forced
evacuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily just leave the debt behind
kind of things, which kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've stuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had our ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys are good balance for each
other for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all boils down to coming back to the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The root of the fruit and about the
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still here doing it almost 50
years old, still doing it, still doing
[SPEAKER_01]: what we love, still smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all getting older, still smoking
good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to smoke the thousand dollar
on an ounce, NorCal Nemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much is this joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it more than one of those hash hole
joints?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably like a three grammer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you figure it's a, it's, you know,
it's a hundred dollar joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's aged properly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who would have thought prices going up
like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was expensive shit back in
the day for sure in LA, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd prepay five thousand bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the dude who sold clones of OG for
10 racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to buy a tray of clones for 10 racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to do it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was, you know, how it got
spread around, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how she got out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause someone else is like, I'm going to
sell two trays for 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a race to the bottom at a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, quality is going to
dictate a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you maintain quality, you're going to
have longevity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, if you're in that,
it used to be 1% and now I think it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.1%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you maintain that level of quality,
you're always going to be successful no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the super fire always sells no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about a thousand dollars an
ounce of shit, but I mean, there's a price
[SPEAKER_02]: point for everything for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I would love to get that,
but we just want everybody to grow their
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the guava gas, the guava gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you roll that or was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I rolled that and I rolled it with the
last bit of flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you smoke your joints all the way to
the thing or do you like you, like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like almost halfway right around halfway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw it into the ashtray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm depending on what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if it's candy and it tastes good
all the way to the roast, I might fire it
[SPEAKER_02]: back up the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I know it's going to like this guava
gas, I'll probably smoke it down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like when I'm going through Fina
hunts, I want to make sure I get down past
[SPEAKER_02]: like the first half inch to inch,
even if it's not that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause sometimes stuff gets better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I can't tell you how many
times like a cannabis cups, I've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: some great fucking great weed,
great looking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you take the first hit off of it
and you're like, yeah, damn, I would want
[SPEAKER_01]: to throw this fucking joint out on the
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just cause it looks good and it
looks good on Instagram doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People hold holding.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, look, breeding lists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I'm glad we're having this
little round table conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who hold onto multiple cuts,
like a fiend, a multiple Finos of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they call it the same thing,
but they have like one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause I know it in Amsterdam,
they used, we would only have one Fino,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fino.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was your selection, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We killed everything off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we be like, we would have,
we would, it wasn't like ever like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got Fino a and tight homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the fucking one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we used to not give the best one
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd keep the best one for ourselves and
then give the second best one or the third
[SPEAKER_02]: best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would only keep the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't keep multiples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's like, so we were talking
about wedding cake as an example where
[SPEAKER_02]: there was like the JBZ selection that was
the fucking the best wedding cake that was
[SPEAKER_02]: real bready and gassy and checked all the
boxes, you know, yielded fairly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was super photogenic and smoke
good, but then he sold seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the seeds got spread out
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's 30 different Finos of what
people think is called the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really what, in my mind is the best
one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like to find the Fino that we like,
and then we like to self that Fino most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you wouldn't, it's never part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, calling out that stuff,
but I think nowadays I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got to look through everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the thing is, is like,
you get some really exciting stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: harms though.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some exciting genetics if you want
to work with it, but you can breed that
[SPEAKER_02]: out to, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I, I used to be exactly like,
so the funny thing is, is when I started
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the industry with the whole seed
thing, I was against feminized seeds and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, that's the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feminized seeds are bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ruining the genetic fucking line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that with feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that with feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did it with autoflower and like
autoflower sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never grow autoflower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't stand behind that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then once you get into autoflower and
you see it's like, fuck dude, it serves a
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has value and you know, if they're good
genetics, they're good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would James Loud be right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't do feminized seeds and he
just made regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't have this spot here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't be doing this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I mean, but that's how it
was right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when Aureon and cause Aureon,
Aureon was the first one, I think with the
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I remember Adam was like trickster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Dutch Passion had him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch Passion, Hank was like one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Hank was definitely one of the first
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right in that same time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But all around the same time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone kind of figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing regular seeds and like,
we were be like, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: come on mate, make fucking feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, nah, bro, you know,
that's just, you know, but then we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's all you really sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there since FEM, since we started
selling feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all, you know, and then the thing
like with autoflower, obviously they need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be FEM because for the most part when
I'm doing them, besides retail,
[SPEAKER_02]: the majority of the bread and butter is
actually going to farms where they grow an
[SPEAKER_02]: acre, two acres, three acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that with reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it just takes a step.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With regular seeds, you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, but I've sold reg seeds and
I got an order from someone in Mexico that
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted me to make a fucking 20 dudes,
20 pounds of reg seeds for them to get
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were just going to have
labor pull out all the mails.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, dude, that's just,
it's such a short window and you'll miss a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have cheap labor, it's not
reality, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So run through the field and mark the
winners that still get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep some Hermes seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your ideal phenohunt size?
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of marking stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's varied, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what happens if you don't have a lot
of the seeds that are left?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that, you know, you gave away for
free and they said, hey bro, those things
[SPEAKER_01]: are fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those freebies, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes down to the selection either
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter if you have a
thousand plants or you have 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a selection, it's like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write, you can play music all you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make songs all you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a song that
resonates with other people, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking mean shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you in there playing a fucking
song.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it boils down to the person who's
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with selection though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I'm getting back to the
selection part is like, if you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing with selection, you're going
to find something great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a thousand to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seed stock that you're going
through is, you know, is good,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have a few seeds of something,
because that's all the seeds there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you select with what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did selections in Arizona on,
you know, a thousand seeds of each string,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a selection and we ended up
with 11 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper State, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did another selection in Columbia that
we just finished last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a selection on 18,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up with, I think,
10 or 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, it's good to do those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of those selections, like in
Columbia, they weren't about, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for things that can deal
with the conditions for the mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: For they're going to die off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that doesn't is going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that small list of what's left,
then that's what you're pulling from as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as your selection, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different kind of selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in Canada, when we did the
selection with Canopy, when they were just
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweed, they were trying to find,
they wanted chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted the strains that we're already
selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted you to find something we
already found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're doing the selection on the
original seeds, but now you're going,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, Aaron, all right, bro, we're going
for chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, all right, Don, we're going for
kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might find something better than
chocolate, but that's not what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not looking for something that's
more this way or more that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually, it's so much more
difficult than people understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, it's like getting a twin of one of
your children.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the coffee, and I'm like,
that's selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see the coffee, we ran,
or we did a whole film over there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was all about selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between every plant, and you're
smelling coffee, but to break your
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking- You gotta clear the palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the funny thing about, you could find
one that looks right, but then you gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: dry it and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, fuck, that's totally
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys have done a lot of breeding
with actual S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say it's an S1, typically it's an
S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a Tangy and it says S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the old Amsterdam model was,
I got train wreck, but I crossed it with
[SPEAKER_02]: White Widow to make the train wrecks,
or critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't play that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still today, because White Widow is
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shit ton of pollen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the window, the pollen window is
really long with White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not so turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really take away from whatever
you put it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, it's very vanilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: It bastardizes everything you cross with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything's here and you cross with
White Widow, the turps are gonna be half.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll still have similar, but OG Kush
with White Widow was the most trash seed
[SPEAKER_02]: that I ever fucking grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought them from a couple different
people because I was like, OG Kush seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made OG Kush seeds in the past using
actual OG Kush on different OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of recessive problems
with recessive things coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that watered it down completely
to where it was something unrecognizable
[SPEAKER_02]: to most people coming from California that
got good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't touch the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've seen the White Widow cross to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even have a White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have White Widow Chocolup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a fucking chunky ass good
White Chocolup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a White Widow that I did like
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one in Cali that was like musky and
it was super strong and called The Sweat
[SPEAKER_02]: and it would make you sweat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Super Silver Haze and we had The
Sweat around like the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sweat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They called it The Sweat, but it was White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the Northern California thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in Richmond, California,
they were growing it and pumping out
[SPEAKER_02]: packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just smoke it, it didn't have a
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke more, you get more high,
you just keep getting more high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stronger flowering or the stronger
fucking smoking varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, sometimes I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't we find some haze just recently
somewhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: The A5 haze is fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember, I feel like I just had
some haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on this NorCal Nemo?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as turpy as like the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but you feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all had full joints in us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked the Nemo Skittles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you smoked the Nemo Skittles,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, how do you put that price on
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's fucking amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes it amazing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super high end clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm happy for those kinds of things
because I feel like it's good for the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the industry that the prices dropped
so much, then you hit these things where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, okay, well, so prices should
come back a little bit for artists and
[SPEAKER_02]: style things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on an artisanal level, people should
be willing to pay more for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some super tasty, some hand-trimmed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some 12-week sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you should pay more.
[SPEAKER_01]: To our distro, we're bringing that to you
and what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we get in the $1,600 ounces?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're done in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $1,800, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: $1,800 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but that was the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we had our old grow in L.A.,
like we grew Skittles would come into the
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation when they'd be tall enough to
make it into the rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd miss like two crops before it can
make it into the rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You miss two chances so it can veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why it's expensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, although my other buddy,
dude, the guys from SF Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: they make it yield like three pounds per
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I think there's different phenos of
it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Amsterdam, they told us our Indica was
only worth $4 a gram because it flowered
[SPEAKER_01]: in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, over in Amsterdam, people want to
like have ways to talk you down anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always like, we laugh when I say
bust your balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take our weed and go, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I was like, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that it was Arion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good one is Aaron and I
finally had some packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of our own shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, not of Soma's diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canelope Hayes, L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate Tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other one, Hashplant Hayes or
Sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp.
Sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought all of them in to the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like our own weed, our own
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're fucking proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, we have a meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a meeting lined up, you know,
in the red light to go upstairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we go to the to the counter and
we look at the most expensive weed they
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we smashed this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this weed that we're bringing him is
better than the most expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like $12 a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bucks a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's six bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want six thousand a kilo now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go upstairs back when you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was upstairs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Arion, Franco, Olaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all upstairs in that little
fucking office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the homies to totally because they're
all fucking.
But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arion looks at it doing his typical,
you know, he's a businessman, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows how to hustle and he knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's Dutch, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and he's in Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was more Dutch back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an old saying if you're not Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes for everything when you're
an American in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just that was just something that you
knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he looks at the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this power plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and him are like, bro, we just
spent like we have no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: His wife's feeding us dinner, bro,
because we literally we need to sell this
[SPEAKER_00]: weed to like get whole again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this motherfucker just said it's
power plant talking shit, talking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in his own little trying to not,
you know, I don't like you kind of way in
[SPEAKER_00]: a more like I'm trying to price down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or get get get some sort of different
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Frank is going through the can of
he's like, oh, Franco's like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like, you know, we're fucking taking
this shit home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and just and in all the years,
you know, Franco and Ariana, he doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: overstep and by this moment, he's like,
we're not we're not losing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not losing this fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys feel some kind of way because
we're all friends, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're like, you're calling my
stuff trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just called my gourmet fucking caviar,
fucking McDonald's dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, OK, we'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not only was it a stamp,
but we had four strains on the menu at
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we had anything, bro, no one to
this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any other company other than
Greenhouse that has had four strains on
[SPEAKER_00]: the menu at the same exact time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, no cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in the day, it was like gray area
was everything was on the menu was from us
[SPEAKER_01]: one time, bro.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gray area was the other place to get
gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gray area was an American.
[SPEAKER_01]: John was an American.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was we used to buy eighths in Ziploc
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was going to like the premier coffee
shop in Amsterdam, getting the numbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: then getting it on the menu as what it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we still have a menu of that
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we sold our weed to Dairy Barneys,
it would never end up as you'd get
[SPEAKER_02]: renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would get renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Red Dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything got renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But John didn't rename the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arianne didn't rename the shit when it
came through.
[SPEAKER_02]: When John had American customers
specifically going there to get American
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, people from New York going to get
Cali weed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like going.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were strain hunting like the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great run with gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: John.
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, bro, we still have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw John when I was just there like two
or three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shop is still hella busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still hella busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still closed at eight o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just there last week,
like I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still closed at eight o'clock.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out with my friend Danny D.,
who's fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Stone's Cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stone's Cafe for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's now evolved into a million
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows what the actual real title
is for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are friends that we've had for
20 years that are in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Max and all the homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pata, Benji.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the shoe shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was our.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were talking about it actually
when we got the shop this last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week I was with Danny and I'm like,
Danny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the time there was like a few
year time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could say this now because it's
over where there was a lot of because Pata
[SPEAKER_00]: had their store on like our street went
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pata's store was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to walk through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our store was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danny's shop was in the red light
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I'm like, how many clones
do you think we sold?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many kilos?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like we were we were like beyond
the weed part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like just just the amount of
boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came through between his shop,
my shop and your shop and ba ba ba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we had like bro, just that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even walk with a box in the
center of Amsterdam without getting
[SPEAKER_00]: searched anymore, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not even a normal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's it's crazy different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about we're like,
bro, that was such a different time
[SPEAKER_00]: because you were just anyway, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it was those were the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good not to be there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Amsterdam has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making seeds, bro, entire ass
genetics and new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went for like four years without
making anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry was in these weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was strange and DNA wasn't the
same as it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys were like going to Canada,
Colombia, U.S., Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys scale too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've scaled it back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Aaron and I are back in the trenches
where we belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing what we're the best at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to we're about to rebuild our
whole website and do that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're creating we're creating seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing the strawberry bananas
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing like the 24Ks back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going for washers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24K is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bangers from before plus new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got sour garlic, the sour Gilroy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 24K I like better than Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangy was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the 24K actually hit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more round.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had some a cushion to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a little hammer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some different flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we're we're able to crack
some seeds, you know, we're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: through a lot of seeds because we're
keeping it small and fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going through seeds, you know,
and trying to trying to find new new old
[SPEAKER_01]: things like we've we've created so many we
feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole time in Amsterdam, when you were
buying seeds, from our shop, we were
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those freebies were hits
within people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we never recreated those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go through some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go through some because we have
stock of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saved it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's just germination rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I'm thinking, like, well,
we can do embryo rescue now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm talking about is just in
case we need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do embryo rescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We soak the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do embryo rescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and hopefully the seed cracks in,
you know, in vitro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's a lot of genetics
that we haven't tried hashrows with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't being tested for that at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have so much stock of like,
like we were going to do a line of of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of countries that don't exist
anymore that we have in our stock of in
[SPEAKER_00]: our vault of just all these different
countries that aren't even countries
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're like seeds from those
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always interesting growing those
land race varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't always.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I grew like for six, seven years,
I grew land race varieties every summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seeds of some of those crossed with
stuff, but like for the majority,
[SPEAKER_01]: none of them really, really like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, why did I waste my time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: More I was more like, why did I waste my
time growing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no real wow factor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you got to do the Simon AK 47 route
where you breed a true F1 with getting
[SPEAKER_02]: land race and putting the work in like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's how I think it would be
more rewarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Line breeding like that then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you want from that F1 to like
stabilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to crack some Ghana gold
cross-tangy seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have some like I didn't,
I didn't really enjoy the Ghana gold,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, like I have the seeds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are value in those seeds,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't ever know what you're going to
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't cracked them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't cracked them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I'm going to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really dig the Ghana,
but I kept it alive and put tangy pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, look, we love the game just as
much to you, just as much as you do,
[SPEAKER_01]: brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: We row in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the plant is, is what,
what got us probably everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we're here today is because,
you know, and that's, it crosses so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brought us all together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought me to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in Amsterdam around a big trim
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm complaining that we have too much weed
to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the trimmers says I could bring my
roommate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been married to her for 17 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't have too much weed to trim,
I wouldn't know my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's, you can't just,
it's not coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's none of these bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally just a part of,
our life and every single thing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been to jail a few times because
of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of bad things happen because of it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, it's an, it's, it's a,
a cut that cuts both ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's good and bad, but at the
end of the day, we're still here and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything great has come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder how many, how many growers have
married trimmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's for percentage, there's
definitely an actual percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's, let's just, let's just put a
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most people watching this podcast
right now have a, a, a, an idea of what a
[SPEAKER_00]: typical trimmer is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some Wook from the fucking
mountains in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the Amsterdam trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're thinking of is totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad or anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He met, he met his wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: He met his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it wasn't like, not that it's
bad, but it wasn't like I was like praying
[SPEAKER_00]: on my trimmers or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like we're in Europe,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had too much weight, we had to trim and
this chick's roommate can come over and
[SPEAKER_00]: she was a dope ass chick and she still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got three wonderful kids because of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still love her more than I did the
first day I met her, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the real, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we all have in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known your wife since I've known you
as well.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's always been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron, we started the conversation off
with, I met my wife at the hostel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, like, you know, we're family men.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one less thing you have to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, when you got someone in your
corner, I mean, all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than less to worry about,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like support, like people that don't
have that and people that don't have,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say the, the, the, that support that
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I feel bad for that, man,
because there's, there's some dark times
[SPEAKER_00]: in life that if you don't have somebody
that's got your back, it's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things difficult, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean you can't get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with having good friends too and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having good friends and family and people
you can talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all those things are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good weed, good weed will help most
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, any of that, that you just
described without weed, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This motherfucker saved me from three
letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our families are friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we don't go on family
vacations or anything, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but it's just like, it's,
it's, it's blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still a slave.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still slaves to the plan,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when you believe in it, it makes
going to work and having to work and like
[SPEAKER_02]: going to work, doing work at home too,
but like working, it makes working more
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing what you love.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, a lot of times we've talked about a
couple of times on my show about your 18
[SPEAKER_02]: year old self and your 82 year old self or
your 80 year old self, the only people you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to worry about impressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, I feel like my
18 year old self, a hundred percent would
[SPEAKER_02]: be like thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see about the 80 year old self,
but I think we're, we're all going in the
[SPEAKER_02]: right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 years away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you guys for coming on the
show today, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to support too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you look out for the James Loud
co-lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do some D line.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it the D line again.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we'll just put it in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolope, AKA D line.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got to figure out what phenome
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I think there's some work to
be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, we have the original
Chocolope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost done with the seed crop of
that right now as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, however we want to do it,
let's just, let's get in the lab and let's
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your lab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can play with our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can give us pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give you pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're freezing pollen too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be doing some fucking
cryo-freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where can they find you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're looking for you, you got
Instagram, you got your website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to post your personal phone
numbers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have copies of our passports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get fooled by all the other DNA
genetics that pop up on your feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking for us is DNA
underscore genetics with the blue check
[SPEAKER_01]: mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we didn't pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our DNA genetics shop is how you
get our seeds in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're visiting Amsterdam, you can go
get the shop, get a hat, get a shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the store, say hi to Rowan,
say hi to Zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't smoke you out, but they'll sell
you shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been there for a long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're family.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep everybody, you know,
like we don't need to exchange people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are good to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In it for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the big vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just needed less people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, Gus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: James loud genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
