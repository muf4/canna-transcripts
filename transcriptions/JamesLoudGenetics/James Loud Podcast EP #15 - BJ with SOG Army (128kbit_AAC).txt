[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My special guest is BJ Hughes from Sog
Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, BJ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather's been nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been too crazy of a summer so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're here local in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and you have a cultivation
facility in Santa Rosa and you're also an
[SPEAKER_00]: MSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working in other states as well,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started out, well, I started out on
the East Coast, came here in 2007,
[SPEAKER_01]: already cultivating for 10 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got into medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I was second gen farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was medical, came here, started doing
things with my internet friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling the shops, getting into licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got licensed and did that whole thing
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: How were those struggles going from
medical and direct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone has their stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but I don't know if I would have
it any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only way, I think, to continue
forward in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the trials and tribulations and
the guys that did it first had it the
[SPEAKER_00]: toughest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was totally like, what do we
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then then there sometimes there was no
answers for stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of waiting going on between
for licensing, you know, getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: license and doing it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laws and rules changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was kind of free for all in
the back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, once they started
tightening the reins on it, it got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was loose at first,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like even going into the
transition from medical and direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were in Sonoma County,
they're pretty chill there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wouldn't say it's the easiest
county, but it's definitely not the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: They offered us a great thing that was
called penalty relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a medical grower that was in
a zoning that they approved and you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to go legal, if you got architect drawn
plans, they would let you transition with
[SPEAKER_01]: temporary occupancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to save our asses by that
as farmers, because at that point I had
[SPEAKER_01]: two license things go in one zoning didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one worked and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're up in Redding, too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that plan going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's a it's a great area for doing
business if you want to pay to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always hot in Redding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's colder in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, bro, we got a lot of snow this
year, more than I had had in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had we had the most rain I've ever
experienced in my life in the Bay here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys also you had a lot of rain
and snow and all kinds of crazy weather up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got feet this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd that affect your cultivation
facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not up and going yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wasn't at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't affect us at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could still make it there to the
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was shocked that the locals were,
you know, still working with snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but yeah, people want to make
money and people people work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was more like electricians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of genetics are you into
these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm really trying to just go more
towards gas these days or old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's what I personally like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kind of boring myself with
skittles lately a little bit for the past
[SPEAKER_01]: six months or year, like just seeing how
much I could smoke because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: previously available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm really kind of just looking
for crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with a guy named Crane
City and working with Mosca Negra a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to hunt through their gear kind of
collaboratively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on our previous show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Rick is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, working with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing selections, helping with
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like trying to find winners,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keepers and winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in all the legal groves, we have phenol
hunt areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be 164 square feet or 64 feet
long by two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 128 square feet that we hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do one plant per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, that's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Redding, we do that every round,
every 30 days, which turns into hunting 80
[SPEAKER_01]: to 100 seed at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we find some cool stuff, but in
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Redding, we set it up around phenol
hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So or the ability to phenol hunt,
bring it to market under a nursery license
[SPEAKER_01]: with distribution and cultivation all
under one house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand typically how long
it takes to get stuff to market from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like from one seed, doing the process of
the selection and then actually growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that out and replicating it big enough to
where you can produce flour of it takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to walk us through your
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our process is I don't know if it's
different, but I feel like it's the old
[SPEAKER_01]: school way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grow seed, we pop seed, we usually
try to go 50 to 100 seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever comes up, comes up at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strong plants, even the weak plants,
we'll let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll grow those plants for three to four
months, which is dedicating a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of area for a small red grow,
you know, because we're only 100 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's a loss leader for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like people want to buy a mixed
bag of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're giving up a large area of
your grow that could be used for flower
[SPEAKER_01]: production for other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to run all those seed the
first time, keeping all the clones or the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed plant in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we'll take a top off the clone or
top off the seed, have a clone labeled to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that's in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that clone, flower it in our test
area one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a rough sort at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just like, okay, whatever 10
that you guys, we all agree as a group is
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep those 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill all the other plants, kill the males
or give them out if people want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move on to the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have those 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's six months at that point,
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grow it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that period, you're seeing
significant change from the seed run to
[SPEAKER_00]: the second generation of clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even the third generation of clone,
there's changes that go on with sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really that second or third time is
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the third run, we, a lot of the stuff
that I showed you earlier before we came
[SPEAKER_01]: on live was third run stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's weird because a lot of the things
I'll say on the first run definitely don't
[SPEAKER_01]: strike my interest at all that over time,
you know, on the second or third run
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the ones that are really hot in
the beginning might not be as great as
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the ones that just didn't catch up
quite as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, wow,
you're looking at a different genetic than
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you find the special
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you skip that step, you have the
possibility of losing a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lost so many things that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing a rough sort killing and
then being like, oh my God, but number
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's been curing or it's been like,
you forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go back to smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh my God, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's kind of our method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we keep everything for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and you're working in what other
states are you in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mississippi now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is Mississippi?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly like you'd imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty progressive when it comes
to weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believer like the locals as a whole,
the state as a whole is more accepting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis than what I've seen in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some like the rural areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are super conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pro weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are doing cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have multiple licenses out there or?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple license transporter, which is the
same as distribution in Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just fart brazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or being a solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably do some carts, but no,
nothing like with alcohol or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a big rosin guy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the little collection you got before
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with rosin and dabs, what are your
favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are your favorite temps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm going in at like 490 these days,
480 depending on the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a 420 guy myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go like cold start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't like doing dabs on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a couple of no-nos that we've
gone through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my previous show that I did before
the podcast, I smoked some Durbin poison
[SPEAKER_00]: with Marlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big no-no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and I, we couldn't remember what we
wanted to talk about half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I try to keep it chill
on the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have any flour to show today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me grab them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we got here is basically a lot of
sisters to our strain pink zaza.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is we Fino hunted two or three years
ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crane city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crane city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was pink zazai actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was never released because he
disappeared for some reason, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sends them to me in a vial with like
blue tape over them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never met the guy in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I get the seeds, it's just a piece
of blue tape written and I didn't see the
[SPEAKER_01]: eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he disappeared for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was zaza.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was already sold as zaza, but it's
actually pink zazai, which is supposedly
[SPEAKER_01]: his take on a acai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was our keeper at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he sent me more from the pink
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is pink duos and pink
Godzilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which are the same father, different
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of, so this one right here is
the pink duos number two, which is not the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that we're dropping yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the one that needed three rounds
that I almost killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost a little cotton candy ish,
little gas to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally this was around three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, we're going to,
you know, and then you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, this might be the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was our keeper before.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pink duos number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a little bit of orange rind in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like the zaza or zazai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel this is more like candy gas or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's more like candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is definitely more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not tangy at all or like Tropicana
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is in everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a little bit of the citrus
rind in it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My partner initially was like,
it's tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot sell it on all that whole line
because he is so like, I hate tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's a hint of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has really nice structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it yields really well,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way the calyx stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like 52 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you finish in 52 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like maybe 55 all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somewhere between 52 and 55,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was shockingly early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to the zaza, which was like 70,
65, 70 to really like, it doesn't even the
[SPEAKER_01]: nose, the look of the flower, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't come out until the last 10 days
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times color doesn't come out
until the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes some stuff is color all
the way through, but a lot of the good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff where it's color, it comes out at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color is so subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love it, hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think taste is more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taste is definitely more important,
but I feel like the market is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: the market demands purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's not fully purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want a little purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking for all purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pink Godzilla, which is a
sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so funny because this nose is
almost in the middle of these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the candy gas, but it also and
they're all like a little hint of the rind
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super small hint of it, but this
checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like market weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the stuff that the hype weed that
everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has the optics and you know,
that the bag appeal, this stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as nutrients, what nutrients
do you run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, we're on Athena right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use compost teas and like humic,
fulvic, bud swells probably 30% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what cocoa brand is your favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using floor flex or a cloud core.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been looking for different
fertilizer companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trialing cutting edge,
louder powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louder powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to uncle John and Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting edge is the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's guys hooked me up and we're giving
it a shot right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any tips, I'm down,
you know, camera or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, it's simple and easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a, it's a good all around
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and I'm not stuck on just
one nutrient line out there saying one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's better than the other, but there
are a few good ones and cutting edge is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely one of the few good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like front row as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think front row, they do a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A front row is always good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: United.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody even really knows about United.
[SPEAKER_00]: United is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's made by the owners of Athena.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, yeah, if you're used to
running, uh, Athena transitioning United
[SPEAKER_00]: is not very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I prepared for like JR crop tech or
anything at our new spot where we had
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I haven't ran it, but I heard that's
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh and Ramsey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we're really knowledgeable
about the product and it made sense to me
[SPEAKER_01]: for how they're trying to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the new place, we have 16 heads on
our H.E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anderson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thought was that we'll always be
trialing a new nutrient line and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get a hold on the science of it
of like what we're seeing versus what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're putting for inputs and, you know,
and also manufacturing of products.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They helped put this facility together at
one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into your history a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, when did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're about my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety-four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety-four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 91, 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was when, you know, it was the wild,
wild west, you know, different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was some purple weed,
but like there was green weed and brown
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was, there was some exotics
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got some stuff in like Maui
Waui.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my dad grew, I was in like a weed
desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Alabama when I was growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no weed, but my dad luckily
grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he grew like Big Bud, Friesland Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had like a... Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he grew from seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grew from seed, from Dutch seed mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Dutch seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I stole his weed, you know,
growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legitimately stole his plants,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stole his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like actual plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stole a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the first time I smoked, I stole a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so... How many plants did he grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like probably 40 or 50 in the backyard,
but he had an indoor garden and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: property in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So assuming now he was just flipping
clones at the end of the season because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like late October and I'm cutting
through the backyard to go to my friend's
[SPEAKER_01]: house and just, there's like 45,
six gallon pots like spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out through the backyard with plants,
like three feet tall, flowered out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they weren't done if you took them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my neighbor convinced me to steal one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we stole it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dried it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're BJ the third.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you should be called Trey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supposed to be your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Trey's I know are the thirds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your business partner is also a Trey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the third, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my other one on Mississippi is a Trey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of Trey's, he's a PJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things were meant to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not a BJ as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's a PJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: PJ, BJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the third.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started smoking back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your father grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: High school job growing weed for my dad's
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad's friends grew weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started being a young stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I didn't want a regular job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started begging his friends,
which turned out to be motorcycle riders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put me on, you know, after
putting me through the wringer a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd worked in a grow house from like 15
till I graduated high school at 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you get from Georgia to out
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: The forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, through the forums, you met guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of us were on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the bikers showed me Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so we were buying seats for Mark
Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily you didn't end up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started going to like Heaven
Stairway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that kind of went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found Gypsy Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forums and ICMAG and Overgrow,
or Overgrow first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made friends on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by ICMAG, I was like doing my own
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had more adult friends and like made a
buddy out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillbilly on PCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hillbilly on PCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a bubble man's original
administrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Full Mount Bubble.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he brought out like a bunch of
people from all over the world and rented
[SPEAKER_01]: out a floor of the metropolis in San
Francisco and showed us the medical days,
[SPEAKER_01]: like showed us the whole ropes of San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were you in the Bay when you first
moved out here?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved to Chico.
[SPEAKER_00]: You moved to Chico?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I could afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: You liked the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia to Chico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't afford anything else,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like insane going from Georgia to
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chico's got a cool college scene,
though, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I partied in Chico and woke up on the
lawn a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some random people's lawn, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in paradise, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had some friends in Cherokee.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were off Red Cherokee Road.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Houses burned down and really rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, there's a lot of good weed up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut my teeth on big plant grows and
greenhouses or just outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get outdoor like big, like,
you know, 100 plants and 400 gallon or
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger pots on irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was big back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like real big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then and then, you know, still rocked
houses, but it was like 20 lighters to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pay the bills and the seasons and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selling the shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got raided in Chico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my guy went to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon B Money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come down to Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 2011 and get linked up with a
local dude, take over helping him revise
[SPEAKER_01]: his farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had like two or three houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still medical scene, still selling to like
Organican and Green Angel and Malibu and
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of rolling around up and down
the coast, selling to the major cities,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with our little bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then legalization happened and it's like,
dude, my whole life changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we go legal or do we not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so went legal because I didn't want to
stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like, you know, like on dead
tour or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I don't want to get off the
train.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so legal was the only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you go on tour back in the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you missed San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, dude, I saw Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 91 like twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't miss getting sick though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three days in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst flu I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't do it this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was too busy building the new thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to see the drone show really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drone show was nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing was nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am used to getting seats usually,
you know, for shows, concerts for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But standing with my buddy, Ben,
we were like 20 feet from the stage all
[SPEAKER_00]: three nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't miss a single song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like one of the better performances
for dead and company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finally got their shit together,
which to be a hundred percent honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was against dead and company when it
first started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, John Mayer, this there's,
you've got to be kidding me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I couldn't believe that John Mayer was
going to be stepping in for Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a little hurt over the whole
Jerry thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to revise it or whatever,
but like he really grows on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: His guitar playing has gotten better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when he first came out,
he had this commercial sound to his voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: which didn't really fit into the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you listen to his voice and
they've, they've filtered it differently
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've changed it a little bit to
where I feel like it just really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: integrates well with the band where he's,
it's part of the band and his solos,
[SPEAKER_00]: he just rips on guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy is just, he's a killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a lot of fun, you know,
it's not Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to be Jerry,
but it was definitely an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard their own tempo a lot more than
they had in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And O'Teal singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, O'Teal singing is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big O'Teal fan too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had a Jerry's hand painted on his
face with the missing finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun and a lot of good people that
I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, I go to spandibus and I
see certain group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to dead and company parking lots and
I see the same friends that I see at those
[SPEAKER_00]: shows, you know, that, that sometimes it's
the only time I get to see those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you do events as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sessions and other stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We up and down the state pretty much
anything legally we can and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: push the boundaries where we can,
if we can work something out, like now
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone's kind of figured out like a
delivery service to help fulfill to a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to go back and talk to your
younger self, you know, in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years of getting involved with
all the knowledge you have now from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you've done, what advice would you
give yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go harder than you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like grind hard as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you think you want to do the show,
but you don't know if you have like 10
[SPEAKER_01]: grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you know you're going to spend the
10 grand to do the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you break even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you break even, do it every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause eventually you'll quit breaking
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows us to break even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still sometimes don't break even
doing shows and it just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the business and it's about
grinding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep grinding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And push harder than you ever pushed
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I think mentally we're not
as tough as we, most people aren't as
[SPEAKER_00]: mentally tough as they actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we think we can only go here,
but we can go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you want to give up,
but sometimes it's just perseverance and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that are left are the ones that
didn't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest fear there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing I regret was I was a
brand and just didn't do shows and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned with building our infrastructure
and I think looking back at it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have been going to shows like
crazy hard like we are now, but you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in one of those giving modes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see, are you giving moods at the
shows I've been going to, we give out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of products for people to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like giving out seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important getting your name
out and you know, like I stand behind my
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stand behind your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great product by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where can people find it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your product if they're looking for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What dispensaries are you guys at in
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in all the Harbor sides and all
their affiliates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in all the Marching Ashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in all the Sparks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Mercy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Duby Nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the Cookies up in the North
State.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the Sundials and all the Sundials
in Redding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in I can't remember our Sacramento
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Lone Park, we're in Royal Healing
and we're in Roots to Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, pretty much all over the whole
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a major store in the area or if
you'd like to see us, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hit you up on Instagram for any
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I get a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sog Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound for Sea of Green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and was that just an epiphany that
came on or how did the name come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my forum name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was your forum name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never was supposed to be a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my forum name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but when I came and I started meeting
forum friends and they were all sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: information about clubs, it was all Sog
Army Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally remember seeing some of your
posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, it's funny now it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's come full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to revive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're going to do a new brand
called Sea of Green for the bigger space
[SPEAKER_01]: in Redding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And drop the Army because I don't think I
ever wanted Army to be in my company name,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I had my younger self,
I would have never said Pick Sog Army as
[SPEAKER_01]: your legal weed brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I want to try to soften it
up a bit as we start producing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soccer mom it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not in the Army.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, no one in our company went
to the Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about military mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an Army of plants and an Army of
workers because what it took, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: an Army of houses actually at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were a lot different back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you wanted to scale, you didn't
scale to a warehouse typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of you guys did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people that did it out there,
but a lot of times it was scale like a
[SPEAKER_00]: monopoly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In monopoly, you get another house,
you get another house and you get another
[SPEAKER_00]: house and you get another house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have friends that had 12 houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business partner, he had 15 houses,
I believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was happy with my A lighter
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one point I got a 50 lighter,
but like there was a basement in the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, but it was houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was, that was how it was
before 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You worked within 200 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you figured out how to make it work,
you know, maybe you can't turn on the
[SPEAKER_01]: microwave and you're definitely flip
flopping problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it, you're maximizing it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, today we have a special guest
coming on for our special guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to welcome Rick Mosca.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing, Rick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, doing well, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rick was our guest from last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just happened to be here and he's going to
be on the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually part of the reason you're in town
was to see BJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a few days together twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in some outstanding farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys got to see flora flame,
which they were our second guest on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now multi-tier to two level indoor living
soil grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a pretty good job, especially at
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not seeing anybody else trying to
do that at scale and not only anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do scale, but two tier scale,
you know, and those beds move like butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He had so much space.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had more space than hydro growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see between the tiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's doing a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's onto something with the
living soil organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think you are going to be
able to charge more for a product like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way his stuff smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grown well, smokes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else did you guys go?
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got to check out the mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw the booth factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The booth factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really great segmentation of every
process along the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, from a clone room with moms to
juvenile plants and then flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing some of those raspberry boogie
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the second hunt, the second go
around on ice pie, raspberry boogie and
[SPEAKER_01]: what was the Hulk side?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's blue mosa and the tag just
ended up saying Hulk, but what was the
[SPEAKER_01]: other side of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that had the planet Hulk in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that has Bruce Banner with our pink
animal crackers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good one actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, there's some growers, uh, phenotype
hunters out of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pulling three pounds of light on
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three pounds of light is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you can get three pounds of
light of good flower, you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's guys that get five pounds
of light, but is it good?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not really into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want quality at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are working on collaborations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found the pink Zaza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick and I have been friends for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like since the forums that I see mag
days, you guys met on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: On IC mag or on overgrow or which,
um, I didn't know him on overgrow,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was an overgrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, HDTV 420 was my moniker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, and so, yeah, I mean,
we really became friends at, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: IC mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend Bacchus, um, who ran a library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick back in the day introduced us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he had like a pretty substantial
clone library.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if people know, but like back
in the day there's people on the forums
[SPEAKER_01]: that add libraries of really sick genetics
that were clone onlys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, you know, we kind of would
develop friend trading circles that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, trade genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had the biggest library I'd ever
seen at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 50 strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had a lot of friends out here that
he would source them from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, he brought a lot of fire to the
old school, new school, just a mix of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Older school.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going back, what, um, 10,
15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this was more old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, more old school, but still like,
I guess, I guess old school now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean, you know, it was like purple
oracles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, or like the OGs and stuff were purple
oracle fire though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I like purple oracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's not the biggest
yielder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a really good
commercial strain or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like GDP too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't like growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather you grow GDP and I'll buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, cause I used to grow, I grew a lot
of GDP, 31 days of edge every time back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just such a short squatty
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, if you don't veg it long
enough, you don't get big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: GDP was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was like the, the, the Fino I had
was dark purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was dark purple and it was
like fucking candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like not necessarily candy
gas, but floral gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like that straight up,
like lavendery flowery floral character
[SPEAKER_00]: with the, with the gas and add nice gas to
it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we met back on the forums in the days
and then, uh, we eventually met at,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, one of the shows here in California,
one of the events and, uh, like high times
[SPEAKER_02]: or emerald is one of the real events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The true events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've stayed in touch ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, um, he's got great respect
for his growing skills, his flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, he sells out all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, he puts his weed where his mouth
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, got to respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's all about quality and top shelf,
you know, and I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what I've been learning from both
of you is that it's all about the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: and anything that's not there doesn't hit
on all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's not worth growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we want to differentiate
ourselves, uh, with that fine quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I think people notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get to see a sold out show at the
Fox of Larry Jean the other night,
[SPEAKER_00]: huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that old school vibes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Larry Jean's not the best performer,
but like it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the crowd was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he expected to see all those
shows sold out from how he acted because
[SPEAKER_01]: it seemed like it was like one show sold
out and then he did another one and
[SPEAKER_01]: another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's super hyped on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: In, uh, 20 years ago, almost now I went in
toward the Fox theater when they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: they went bankrupt and they were
basically, it was for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we didn't have the $10 million
that they wanted for that place,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That place for $10 million would have
killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure exactly how they got it
back, but it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good location.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much history there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that one building and good
acoustics, good acoustics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were feeling that base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't leave anything in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uber's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Uber idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That area is just a rough area for parking
and for theft.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people breaking windows and,
uh, I've had windows broken and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had, uh, stuff where there was stuff
in the car with Jason from house of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in town and we had our luggage and
he had put his luggage in the back seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they fucking broke the window,
took everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's Oakland for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just gotta be smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your head on a swivel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floor flame is not the safest area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys have been getting hit over and
over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got hit more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys have come back multiple times and
then they had it on the news commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: forklift lifting up their gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big thing is, is like,
even if they don't get flour, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times they do damage to your property,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the property damage costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like insurance just covers
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, or if it is insurance, there's
deductibles, you know, so people were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get any flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they did damage.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything costs money, especially with
the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look, you look, you look at your
equipment the wrong way and it's another
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go try to tinker on your ACs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a certified AC tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we, you know, I got, I,
I ended up with the pink Zaza two years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago or something and Rick and I trade
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and have always traded clones
freely, like back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sent it to Rick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you got to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I sent him the pink Zaza and we
think that's probably going to be some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the better collaborations we've done
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a blue Mosa collab too that worked
out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Mosa S1s and then some blue Mosa
hybrids with the blue Hulk and or the
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible Hulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're then selling the flower and
you're selling the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are selling them together.
Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does seed out of your flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I select and, um, yeah,
sometimes he selects.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of, part of our process here is to
actually have the flower of all the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of it, but I can give
you an example of anything that we have on
[SPEAKER_00]: our menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a flower sample to back,
whether it's clone, you know, we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some interesting CBD stuff, CBV,
um, you know, THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's, it's wild, but we want to
have samples of everything available,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially like when we get our shows in
California, we will have flower samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cultivation partners too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, that's what I think an educated
consumer is looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone, it's, it's, it's just a
standard that should be the norm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planning and patience and all those good
things for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but anything good takes time and
requires a lot of planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than you would ever think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And execution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Execution and organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think organization is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both kind of talked about, you know,
note taking, we talked about grinding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to talk to your younger
self with all the vast experience you've
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired over these years, and you talk to
yourself, the one or two years in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, what advice would you give
yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, um, probably to, uh, double check to
make sure that, uh, we understand where
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants are in trying to keep them
happier than we already do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have so many different things in
the works that, you know, one thing is off
[SPEAKER_02]: kilter and it affects everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just be able to,
um, take that extra time to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, some double checking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think it's really worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: BJ said grinding grind harder than you
ever thought you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like going to a strip club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stripper mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely stripper mentality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work hard though.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's about hard work for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard work and working smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to work smart too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a great key point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we were younger,
I believe a lot of people said work smart,
[SPEAKER_00]: not hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my father was one of those people that
said work smart, but work your ass off,
[SPEAKER_00]: work hard, work smart, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those two things super
important, you know, because there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: people doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why quality is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't so important 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could still sell your weed if you
sucked at growing, you suck at growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't sell your weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even the home grow guys,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like genetics play a huge key
role in everything and also quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without, you know, that quality,
it's all for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like a lot of guys and the guys
I've interviewed lately, and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are still here smiling are really
passionate about what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of them smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all smoke, you know, so we,
and we're all roughly the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all went through the same trials
and tribulations to a degree within the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw these changes from the nineties
on up and it's a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think with us individually working
with that passion, but running at,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, near capacity or a hundred
percent that just ups the level of flower
[SPEAKER_02]: and genetics we create.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's gonna set our work apart
because we've taken the time to put in all
[SPEAKER_02]: those steps and making sure that they flow
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that's what makes these kinds of
meetings fun because we get to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: each other's flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like seeing new stuff, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, especially with you,
we get to experience some new crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like some new stuff I've never
seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that raspberry boogie has this real
sourness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's almost musky,
but not musky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely incense-y tiny little bit,
but like in a good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a nice bouquet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a nice, beautiful bouquet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that stuff is loud and it smokes
loud and yeah, you get fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of character.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like eating a whole meal,
dessert, organic dessert, fresh berries.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which we have a little flower
if you want to take a look at her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Zeros Raspberry Boogie bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating
crackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one also has that funkiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where it's like, it's funny cause like
it's from the Zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seriously interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it smells like, it's not like pine
needles, but it smells like a forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get this forest smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get like this creamy sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this raspberry, sour raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sour cherry and raspberry maybe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it translates in the smoke,
which I'm sure it will, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like really, really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, I like these complex
smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like complex flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my problem with the Agent Orange
from Subcool back in the day was that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was straight orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like actually House of cultivar had a Fino
of Agent Orange that wasn't straight
[SPEAKER_00]: orange, but like all the other ones I saw
in all the flower, I saw coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt that was Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was an easy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were busting those out back in the
day, you know, and this is like 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, maybe that Agent Orange was straight
orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, there was no complexity to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even as complex as Tangy and you
know, Tangy is pretty, pretty orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a little rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like straight laminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like orange cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like orange cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I thought of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't cleaner, like the burning
your nose kind of cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like missing that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Clean like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very linear, you know, mono turpish
or, you know, it's like, but, but like
[SPEAKER_00]: something like this, this is the complete
opposite end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you got complexity,
where you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different recognizable
smells, but you got to kind of pick them
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one is our collaboration with BJ
and Saag Army.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a Zope to the pink Zaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stuff looks fricking nuts,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I mean, you got sugar leaf on
here and the sugar leaf is just sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We leave it on because it's so crusted
with, with resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one has that orange rind,
has a little bit of that rind in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan of that rind when it's
subtle like that, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another complex one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an offspring of our seeds,
you know, that we put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little soapiness to this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soapiness is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it reminds, it's the funny thing is
just like, I took bubble baths as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of us took my parents,
you know, when we were little kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember taking a bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is like 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Mr. Bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a Mr. Bubble smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to come up with a name.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Bubba smells like Irish Springs a
little bit, you know, like Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has more of the Irish Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of bubble smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more like bubble bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like straight up nostalgic from when I was
a five-year-old kid, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about flower though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like being able to bring back memories of
being a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I thought about like bubble
baths or like kids bubble baths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have kids, fortunately or
fortunately, I guess, depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those mixed things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it'd be great to have kids in
some ways, but in other ways, it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to travel and to see the world
and, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like some of all of kids when I'm
like 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm hoping for too,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30-year-old girlfriend at the time,
Jessie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I remember her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little Jake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake is adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw him not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year in Amsterdam.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my number one stop is over at
Summer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically my first or Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of friends there,
but yeah, I love Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stopping by there and stopping by the gray
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little while since I've seen
John over at the gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first time I ever smoked bubble
gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was real bubble gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the best bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was during one of the high times cups
