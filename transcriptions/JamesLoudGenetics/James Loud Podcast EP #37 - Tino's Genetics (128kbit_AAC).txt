[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
lab podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today my special guest is Tino from
Tino's genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today, Tino?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been hanging out a little bit
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon brought you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when we filmed the first episode,
we met, we went to lunch and you hit it
[SPEAKER_00]: off and man, thank you for coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a, it was a blast.
[SPEAKER_07]: That barbecue was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got good barbecue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like Texas, but it's, you know,
it's good for California.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, I was really impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, being able to see the,
see the facility and everything the first
[SPEAKER_07]: time I was like really blown away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like really cool what you're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about you and how you get
your start in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I got my start kind of, um,
you know, just growing, growing,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, selling weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I first started out just,
uh, selling really.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, then I just evolved into a
growing and making seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you sell before you smoked or what do
you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a common theme with a lot
of people, but I mean, I think I was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, you know, I got into
psychedelics a little first, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like more like the athlete type of
guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got hurt playing sports.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started selling weed and, and then I
started smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like fell in love with it,
you know, and, um, and then I was lucky
[SPEAKER_07]: enough to meet someone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody that, you know, had really good
weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I became like the guy that had the
good, but you know, and, and, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is like, oh, two, oh three type
type there, you know, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: so yeah, I met him and, and, uh,
I just got all this, all this weed,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you know, we were, I started selling
a lot of bud and, uh, being able to see
[SPEAKER_07]: all the different types and question like,
all right, where's, where's this stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: coming from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's, you know, who's growing this stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And seeing all the different kinds come
out and, uh, and it really was just like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I want to, I want to get into
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to grow and I want to learn how to
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, um, you know, I really started
growing like, oh six, oh seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, really, really got into like
wanting to make seeds right away,
[SPEAKER_07]: right away, right into the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, did you have friends that made
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you desire?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I didn't really have anybody,
no forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like total, nobody in my family,
you know, I'm first generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just kind of figured it out,
like kind of on my own.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a, a Soma, that Soma style.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only book I kind of found.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I started reading there and he started
talking about how to make Feminite seeds,
[SPEAKER_07]: like naturally, like how you naturally
reverse the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I started doing that like oh seven,
oh eight, you know, right when I started
[SPEAKER_07]: learning how to grow, you know,
so it was like, um, I figured out really
[SPEAKER_07]: quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, I got to learn how to grow
first before I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I was trying to do both at
once and, and, uh, did, it did like
[SPEAKER_07]: develop, you know, uh, together,
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, so, you know, my whole thing was
to make Feminite seeds and to make stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: for myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to make, you know, uh,
strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody knew like, you know,
back then you stick your head in a bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could be like, oh, that's,
that's Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's this Kush or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it used to be all this purple,
whatever, you know, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: be distinctive.
[SPEAKER_07]: There wasn't like a million strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a lot more, but not like
there is now, you know, there wasn't 300
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: A million runs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, right, you know, and then you
got the guys that are kind of making fun
[SPEAKER_07]: of gelato and skittles, but they like love
runs and everybody's confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is confusing to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's a lot of people
that are confused by what quality is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is a hundred percent to blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that before Instagram,
we saw the bud and there was a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: about effect, but then all of a sudden
Instagram came out and we saw these
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful photos and people like,
that's the one that because the way it
[SPEAKER_07]: looks, that's definitely Instagram is
there's Instagram weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely a thing for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like back then it, it effects is
really what, what mattered and,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, and the high, you know, you want to
get one, we want to fill it, you know what
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of this stuff now is just people
are, are seeing pictures and basing their
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding off of that and not even really
growing it out and smoking it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I laugh at some people that,
you know, they post a picture and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: like, it's like wheat six or seven.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, this is my keeper.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, so you're, you're not even
picking, you're not smoking it or are you
[SPEAKER_07]: just going by how it takes Instagram
pictures?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like so many people were like,
yeah, I totally base everything off of
[SPEAKER_07]: not, not really like tests so much as like
just me smoking it because, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the test, you know, but it's what I
want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what gets me high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what I like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that's why I originally started.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really start making seeds to sell
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made them for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and, uh, I've done a lot of,
a lot of testing, a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of R and D smoking, you know,
smoking my own strains and then also
[SPEAKER_07]: stress testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I fully believe in, you know, stress
testing your plants, growing them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the only way you're going to
really get strong FIMS.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I really stand behind my FIMS and I've
done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've been messing around since 2008.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really made serious FIMS till
like about 2015, 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um, you know, my company
started, I started it up in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you started with a lot of stable
genetics though, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like the stuff back,
you know, 15 years ago was a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable than it is today, especially
sexually stable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it, it really was a lot more stable
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was easier for me to really learn
more about uh, breeding and how to make a
[SPEAKER_07]: good FIMS and you know, how it all works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I'm kind of just, you know,
going off that Soma book and, and,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, you know, teaching myself a lot of
trial and error, a lot of growing and to
[SPEAKER_07]: get where I'm at today.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, if you cross stuff, that's very
distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're crossing two gelatos,
it's hard to see what the progeny is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting from the two parents,
which one it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you have like a sativa and you
have something that's more short,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sativa and some small, something tall and
then the Finos are really easy to,
[SPEAKER_07]: to pick out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's, it's, uh, that's one of my
favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I like, uh, doing a lot of breeding
with green crack.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the old green crack, uh,
cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special strain though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I build a tolerance to it really,
really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you smoke it for the first time
after you harvest it, it'll rock your
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, by the time you're
sharing it with your friends a week later,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have this big tolerance to it and
they're all just getting their asses
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked by it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, um, but still I'll think I have
a tolerance built up to it, but I'll go to
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke it when I want to go to sleep and
I'll just be staring at the wall for three
[SPEAKER_07]: hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like, Oh my gosh,
I can't go to bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I like the, do some breeding
with the green crack.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's old strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it, you know, I'm from,
I'm from Fresno.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like a lot of, a lot of good
strains, a lot of good breeders have come
[SPEAKER_07]: out of that around that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Hayes brothers that originally
bred that blue dream green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a unique strain and so many
people grow it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a part of a part of cannabis
history.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people grew it and, uh,
you know, and I think it's just so special
[SPEAKER_07]: because it grows so much like an indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so small and it has such a sativa
high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrous oxide and beef jerky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best smelling stuff on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's an interesting plant for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I plan on actually mixing it with,
uh, Panama red.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause, uh, I actually had it phylosed,
uh, the green crack and, uh, it's the
[SPEAKER_07]: furthest apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know everybody doesn't like phylose or
whatever, but you know, they kind of fell
[SPEAKER_07]: off a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the furthest apart in the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figure, you know, there's a lot of
bottlenecking going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you see the gelada.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's totally crazy and people
don't even realize really, what they're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing to the genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't understand the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they think they're making
out-crosses when they're inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the biggest
problems today is we get all these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that are thinking they're making new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making novel stuff and they're
not, and they're taken away from the vigor
[SPEAKER_07]: and they don't realize you're,
you're degrading the genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to find things that are further
apart, bring them together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what creates the vigor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you find like a special plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I make some crosses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I'm just like, man, this is,
this is better than the, the mom and the
[SPEAKER_07]: dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the goal of breeding at the
end of the day is to make something better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the mom and the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're just like, holy shit,
they're complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a completely new thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really have too much of either
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make something better than both of
the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's what a lot of
people fall short is they make stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not better than neither one of the
parents.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're still, they don't even test it
and they put it out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of, a lot of that going on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it as a whole within the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, the second people get
fixated on one thing, whether it's candy
[SPEAKER_00]: or whether it's purple or whether,
you know, we start fixating on one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take away a lot of the diversity as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it doesn't seem like we're doing
it because everybody's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone jumps on this train and it's
not necessarily the right train.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm guilty of it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a bunch of a lot of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like, at least I'm aware of
what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what sells right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not following the trends,
then you're not necessarily going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I like to sell the weed to taste
good when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of this stuff now, I'm just like,
oh, I feel like we could have hunted this
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, some of this stuff is just like
not, these are older turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, where are these coming
from?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're already done with these,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're branded as new turps, but they've
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so crazy to hear some new name on the
old, I'm like, no, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's, Jack Herrera is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jack Herrera used to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's associated with a bad name,
but like some of the Jack, the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacks that we were seeing and in the
nineties and early, like early two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands, the one that I was seeing was
like, definitely like more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't so straight, tropinoline,
limonene.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it definitely got you ripped
off your ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't not like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just when somebody presents it as
something else and then it's, it's clearly
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't call it that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot call it that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's Blue Dreams, another one that
got renamed a bunch and the Blue Dream is
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really was.
[SPEAKER_07]: The turps got burnt out, you know,
here in Cali, because so many people were
[SPEAKER_07]: growing it because it was so easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're hitting three alive back
on the double ended bulbs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a single.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting two point two pounds and
like that, that back in the day was like
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone got one point five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had gotten two point two on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I always had this saying
that you could shit in the reservoir and
[SPEAKER_00]: still get two pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with Blue Dream, you really could say
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be like, you could piss on the plant
and it'll still come out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll still come out good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge chunky.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we were doing like the DWC hydro back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll dive into that because you're big
into the DWC and I think you grow really
[SPEAKER_00]: good DWC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy from Master Yoda, he's,
he's a big DWC guy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wins a bunch of competitions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people, people knock it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People knock hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knock three part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knock all these things, but you know,
weed grown correctly is good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like weed growing well is
good weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like a lot of people on the hydro,
whatever it is, recirculating,
[SPEAKER_07]: DWC, bubble pond mix, whatever it is,
it's all, it comes down to the flush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and you, you can't flush it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a short flush and you need to be
flushing with nutrients for a period of
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not, not just, you know, these guys,
if you give it five, seven days of just
[SPEAKER_07]: water, you just ruined your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you go in the room, it's sticky,
it smells, it's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a couple of days later,
it's just dry and you know, I've done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've flushed for too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, I really feel like it's in the
flush and really what you're putting in
[SPEAKER_07]: the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have healthy roots, if you have,
if your plant is growing healthy,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's, it's just that little bit
at the end, every, every medium needs a
[SPEAKER_07]: different flush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I feel like I do do the old
DWC.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do the general hydroponics buckets
really, but I just made it with the halos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the halos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's just the, the rapid
growth that you get with deep water
[SPEAKER_07]: culture, especially with those halos,
you could totally cheat with the halos
[SPEAKER_07]: because the water can go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the water level is really important
doing DWC and recirculating.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with the halos, it's totally cheating
because the water level could,
[SPEAKER_07]: could almost be emptied.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as long as that halo is still dripping
on the top, the plants, the plants are
[SPEAKER_07]: still fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you don't want to do that,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you flush with sugars and like,
you know, sugars at the end and magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: or enzymes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sugars and just a little bit of,
I don't really push.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just give it like the regular,
the regular, uh, like a ripen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just, just lower the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just slowly lowering the PPMs all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, uh, within that flush week,
you know, week nine or 10, whatever you
[SPEAKER_07]: decide to do, uh, usually go 63 to 70
days, depending on the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of my, a lot of my stuff is,
is done at 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot stronger too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the stuff that goes,
you know, cause some of the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just depends on the varieties
you have, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the genetics is like Skittles is
like a 53 to 56 day plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skittles is so funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause everybody loves Skittles and it's
like this hash thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, it is really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: The turps are just amazing, but everybody
wants these huge washers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But Skittles is like one or 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's yeah, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It grows like the worst plant ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it just doesn't want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the polar opposite of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the exact obvious.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like that, uh, that movie,
uh, twins.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Danny Devita.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Danny Devita of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great analogy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think there are some good
Skittle crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you helped me, uh, you were,
you entered in the contest, but you also
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that was so much fun to judge
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of good entries in the first
and second place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both Skittle crosses on steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they were both stronger than
the original.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I wasn't trying to talk bad about
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Skittles is just, it really goes to
show that turps really win in the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, look at that plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't wash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's washing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's growing wrong and it shrills
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, if you have the proper
turps, you know, the other stuff doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when we're, I'm starting to wash
all my strains and getting into,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, into washing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a gas man, exotics helping me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a, he's big into washing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has a super good brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the, on the come up right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's, uh, yeah, he's doing great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like 2016 or 17 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys use resin dial to test for,
you know, we have, I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get into the resin dial.
[SPEAKER_07]: I w I want to get one of those for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a back order right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, the resin dial is like the
next step, but right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like doing whatever he says,
you know, how they say you got to,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's, it's all funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you, you put your fingers on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do this, you see how much comes off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You, you want the, not the, you want the
grit, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not greasy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want, um, they say like gelatos don't
wash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't watch, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks frosty cause the stems,
you know, of the, of the actual trichrome
[SPEAKER_07]: you want, you're looking for like a
shorter trichrome with a bigger head is
[SPEAKER_07]: really that breaks off easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of, I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't quote me, but it's kind of more what
you are more for the washing washing side,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'm more into the Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to walk, you know, I'm into
washing all my stuff right now and getting
[SPEAKER_07]: the proper percentages like to rosin,
you know, a lot of people are like,
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got whatever percentage they say 9%,
6%, 19% 10% like all this crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, okay, well percent of what
is that with the food grade?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that to hash is, or is that pressed
out, put in the jars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I want to, where, you know,
where's, where's the percentage at,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause uh, everything that I'm doing,
what's, you know, the end, the end
[SPEAKER_07]: product.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, plus there is a lot of,
uh, leftover food product, like the one 60
[SPEAKER_07]: and the, and the, uh, 40.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we make.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, like the edibles, we make the still
great for food, great for food for
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure a lot of people are, are mixing
it in there till they get higher
[SPEAKER_07]: percentage and they're calling it a full
spectrum, full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm just like, no, you're making
it sound better, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, it's like, you gotta put it in there
otherwise it's not full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff going on in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of it on, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like, you know, a lot of the
Instagram breeding is, is crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: The picture breeding is just, it's a lot
of, uh, you know, I do my best to get out
[SPEAKER_07]: there and try to teach people the right
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, uh, we do a lot of like home
growers stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we try to really get like new growers,
the people that don't grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: try to get people on the page that,
that don't grow and then convert them into
[SPEAKER_07]: growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, man, look, this is really easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really try to get into the deep
water culture, uh, right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I feel like it's easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I feel like it's forgiving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people would be like, it's not
forgiving.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's really quick, but it
compared to like soil, I forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it really is easier to
understand like what's in that bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not right, you could just dump it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have the exact opposite feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've struggled with DWC and soil has
that buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like the buffer and then I like
cocoa and I like the effect of soil is the
[SPEAKER_00]: main thing, but like, yeah, it's what you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once, once you've like mastered it,
it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I have that old three part
nutrients from, uh, not the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the old chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just really works well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like really hard to find online.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why, but, um, I run that the
general hydroponics three part,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in there and it just,
it works really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the growth is just, you know,
three or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I can't grow, I can't veg any
longer than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the plants are just absolutely huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest one I got was, um,
I mean, I've hit, I've hit a pound on the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, but like consistently is like
anywhere from like 10 ounces, 12 ounces,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, some 14s, but it's like three
week veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting 10 ounces on a plant,
you know, it's, it's, and it's really
[SPEAKER_07]: fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and it stinks, you know, you,
you do the flush, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that comes out and you're
really, really here to be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: look guys, you could, you can still get
just as good as a weed with DWC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I can see like, um, organics
being better in the way of like,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, more of a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably has more of a longer shelf
life, you know, and, uh, and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: organics is, is, could be better or
whatever, but it doesn't mean that DWC is
[SPEAKER_07]: turpless and it's not good.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's all about the grower too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has a lot to do with the grower and
a lot to do with what they're doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: it and flushing it and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a lot of guys that they have stuff
that's tasteless too, that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: taste with a lot of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're giving everybody else a bad
rap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, yeah, I've seen a lot of that
organics is like some of it's like really
[SPEAKER_07]: good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of it's like really just not that
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing is, is so in the contest
that we just judged, which, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, it, it, we're, I'm announcing in a
couple of days, but we're actually filming
[SPEAKER_00]: and this won't be aired for a couple of
weeks, but we had cocoa, we had soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had hydroponics all against each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys who say living soil is the
best hands down, they were wrong as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what the loudest, but it was, it was grown
in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then the living soil
came in second and, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's real interesting because,
you know, people always want to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this is the very best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, that's the very best
way for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, that's what I really try to
tell like, uh, people that are starting to
[SPEAKER_07]: grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we have a, like I said,
I started the home growers just start
[SPEAKER_07]: growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, look, just cause it's that,
that guy's doing it that way or this guy's
[SPEAKER_07]: doing, there's a million different ways
you can grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just need to find your way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can't, you're not going to do it
exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how I am, I'm going to guide you and
you're going to have to find your own
[SPEAKER_07]: little groove.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and that's just how it works for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not one, one way of growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of different ways and you
got to just find your, your way of doing
[SPEAKER_07]: it that you like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, learning how to grow in
general is just, that's an, that's an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably the best thing to
learn in the beginning is just how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just growing skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be wheat either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can grow, you can grow anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always run a garden outside with a bunch
of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoy growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Growing plants and having a garden and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really therapeutic, you know,
especially people are just, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of these guys, it's what they do in
their gardens, their meditation time,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's, it's a, so it does a lot
of different things for people,
[SPEAKER_07]: not just smoking it, growing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there's, there's some pride in,
you know, people, there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: special about growing something and then
consuming it, whether you're smoking or
[SPEAKER_00]: eating it, you grow a tomato and you eat
that tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes extra special.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why everyone
thinks they have the best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it and they're like,
you know, and because there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: attachment to that plant, especially if
you took the time and like breeding is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way, but if you're growing a plant
and you've put the days in, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: 53 days or 70 days of flower, plus it's a
veg, you've, you've cared for that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout its entire life and then
consuming it, you have a special
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and not everybody can understand
that, but same thing with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking two things, you're
crossing them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, breeding is the marathon,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it may take you years to properly
pheno hunt and you know, a year to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly get something out to where you
could even bring it to market if you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that's really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you understand the, the life that
plant and its parents had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, we know what's gone into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's gone into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's something special about
popping a seed that you made and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, to fruition to where you
have flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think everybody should
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think there's nothing wrong
with people breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think understanding what you're doing is
important, but also just going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process so you can understand that
fulfillment because I get fulfillment out
[SPEAKER_07]: of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage everybody to make their own
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they have any questions on how to,
you know, reverse the plants or anything
[SPEAKER_07]: like that, you know, feel free to,
to ask, you know, and, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: we, we promote, you know, the home growers
to, to definitely do, do their own thing
[SPEAKER_07]: and growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, what you,
you put into that plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, and it's like, you're not at the,
at the club or buying weed and you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: have no idea what they sprayed on it or
remediated or whatever that word is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you don't, you don't know
what's, what's on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you grow the plant yourself,
you grow it up, you know, what you put
[SPEAKER_07]: into it, the time, the effort,
you have a new respect and, and,
[SPEAKER_07]: and really passion for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really fell in love with, with growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I really, I really liked it when
I first started doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a lot more challenging than
people think, but it's, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think some people get into it
for the money and then they realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actual work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is actual work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're slowly becoming tomato
farmers and I think tomato farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they deserve a lot of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's pretty amazing what tomato
farmers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that cannabis farmers and
tomato farmers, you know, it used to,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this celebrity, you know,
side of it, but that's more or less in the
[SPEAKER_00]: financial side of it, isn't what it used
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but you can make a good
living, whether you're a tomato farmer or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can do it legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's been so crazy to see over
the last 20 years, how everything's
[SPEAKER_07]: changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, cannabis, it's everything,
uh, rapidly changes all the time,
[SPEAKER_07]: rapidly really quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is the new strain boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is the new strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, it's just like,
and seeing a, like the wax, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, evolved from us, you know,
you know, blow and butane through a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a PVC pipe, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like in 2006 or seven and then to where we
got the rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's like, just totally crazy to see
it all come through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just all the different
techniques along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was there in the beginning
where we, we had to go through all the
[SPEAKER_07]: techniques and it was really quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what are you doing now to how,
how, how did you make the pool and snap or
[SPEAKER_07]: how did you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have dab rigs back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked them on coals or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot knives, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the hot knives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a, that's a day wrecker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that don't know,
hot kniving is where you take hot knives
[SPEAKER_00]: from your parents drawer from the
silverware drawer and you put them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stove till they're red hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't do it with rosin,
but you use old school hash and a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towel tube or whatever kind of tube you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people have done it with straws,
but the paper towel tube is ideal because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can kind of put the knife tips as you
smash and put it in there and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: get this big, huge, hot, gigantic dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cough typically super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, Oh God, I think we got
to the point where we weren't getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: coughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't cough, you know,
but, but then our friends did,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I've told the story about my
buddy who he just got so wasted and then
[SPEAKER_00]: went out and sat in his car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like giving somebody their first dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was making the dads back in like 07,
08.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like super early on, you know,
they come to your house, they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I'm going to, you know,
kind of they're down.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I want to, I want to like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take a dab, you know, to check it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you want to give them a big old
dab, but they're like going to chill and
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke a blunt and buy a sack.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're going to hang out,
just give them this big, huge destroyer
[SPEAKER_07]: dab, all red hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: They hit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just see them, you know,
their whole face.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just, you can see them get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, their eyes start watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly their ears are purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just out of here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't buy any weed or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the old dabs, we use titanium too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like those things, you get that
titanium nail real high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It started out with the little glass,
the stupid, the swing arm and then the
[SPEAKER_07]: glass nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we, we thought we really upgraded
when we got the titanium now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like a chess piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally the quartz little nail quartz
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the quartz nail and then that
was like the first rigs that the quartz
[SPEAKER_00]: nail would go in and the little thing on
the top of it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're smoking that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was making a lot of, a lot of BHO with
back PVC.
[SPEAKER_07]: We finally got the glass, but yeah,
open blasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you whip, you use like Pyrex
dishes?
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to figure it all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: At first we didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: At first we didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Pyrex glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: We would double boil it and we were like,
okay, if you do this, it turns yellow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're like, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we finally, finally figured out,
you know, we were always not letting it
[SPEAKER_07]: finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would always be goopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just leave it in that hot
plate, keep longer and longer and longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it finally would, would turn into
wax wax.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you got the ear wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like ear wax.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why everybody called it ear wax.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, once I figured that out,
it was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, slabs as long as your arm,
big old chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after that came like the,
you know, like shatter and stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're putting it in the purge,
the purge ovens and you got the pizza
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes, the slabs and the pizza boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know all about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the pizza boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a long history.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pizza boxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of slabs been in the pizza boxes,
but yeah, that's not how we came up with
[SPEAKER_07]: that idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our brand is, uh, is pizza Italian
involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, my, my character is like a pizza guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I dress up as them and where did that
evolve from?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, it really evolved from about like
2016, 17.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I started going to the sessions,
you know, it's before we were like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, grow, everything's a secret.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to know you get away,
you know, like I just sell the packs to
[SPEAKER_07]: this guy and get out of here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll buy them from this guy, you know,
but now we're like coming out Instagram
[SPEAKER_07]: and totally, you know, so I got a brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a big tent.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put this logo on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it, and we started going to the
sessions and everybody thought I was
[SPEAKER_07]: freaking a pizza guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, everybody would come up to the
booth and this is before I had this logo
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just had this logo and a big
tent and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody would come up to the booth
thinking we had pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for sell, you know, like, and they're
like, Hey, so how much for a slice?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, yeah, we don't have any pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they would freaking walk away,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just like thinking, and it
happened like a couple of times or a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of sessions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't do very good at the session.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to come up with, I got to figure
something out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, you know, it was just
online looking at different packaging and
[SPEAKER_07]: pizza box came up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You put your logo on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, Oh, I'm just going to do the
pizza box.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I got the pizza box.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, all right, what am I going to
do?
[SPEAKER_07]: They come to the booth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to put some weed in here
and some seeds and some waxes,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, just to try to lure them in.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So they would come up to the booth and
they would be like, yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: where's the pizza?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, sure enough, you know,
the next week I'd be like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I turn around, I get I get the
box and, you know, I open it up and and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're like, Oh, you know, it's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a conversation starter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they tried this stuff,
you know, I'd have them because my main
[SPEAKER_07]: goal back then when I first started coming
out was and always is to have,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a really loud fire strain that
people was was really distinctive to
[SPEAKER_07]: smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would have at the sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bud and the wax that I made,
I made it, you know, grew it myself,
[SPEAKER_07]: made the wax myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'd have the seeds available.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd be like, all right, take that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Free dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody's taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, Oh, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, take a smoke to some of this weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, we can teach you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I got a lot of people
growing like that, and it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: satisfying to see people grow your stuff
out and really come back and be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: man, that was really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I started growing and and they
have a big old huge room now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's really how the the pizza
box came.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I came up with this this guy and
I dress up as him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really the whole story there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like I like the die cut packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Die cut is in for one thing, but like
these are you can put a thousand of these
[SPEAKER_00]: in one little box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some other packaging, too,
like boxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have some stand up packs where it's
like a it's really like a dab container.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it has seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just doesn't work for like the seed
banks and people like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I could only fit like two of them in a
little package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like to get a big order for them
to hold it at the seed banks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just takes up too much room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like these a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in a really good guy that designed
those for me is that even the seed that
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm holding is like reflective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I like I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like, you know, details on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what about the details?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's what we always started to
have.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I started growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make my own stuff because I had
so much access, access, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: living in Fresno right then to really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm interested about a snow beef
because I'm not a huge fan of apple
[SPEAKER_00]: fritters because it smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the smell doesn't carry
over in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking a joint of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I always say, apple fritters,
Oreos, purple punch, they're one step away
[SPEAKER_00]: from being good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just feel I'm not a fan of
purple punch at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like a punch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the other one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oreos, Oreos, Oreos, purple pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a picture weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's great on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they make some decent cry.
[SPEAKER_07]: They make some really good crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that Dante's Inferno, I think it's
kind of the same a little bit over ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I think it's as far as the
genetics are concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's got a really unique nose on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could smell the Oreos in there a
little bit, but it's got it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it much better than Oreos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew that in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wasn't really a fan of the Dante's
because it was just the weakest genetics
[SPEAKER_07]: in there was the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: To go, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just about strong genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to bring back the rigidity of the
plant, you know, like the green crack.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like pretty PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really worked a lot of strains for
the East Coast outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really focused on that for the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like nobody's doing that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's really going on the effects.
Nobody.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: The turps, they're just going off of
pictures and names.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just it's not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, everything we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ebbs and flows and in every facet of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're we're in the gelato phase right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the case where people are really
locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also see, oh, gee, making a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely hazes popping up here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the Piff in the Cuban black and,
you know, some some old school haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they're making some comebacks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like the haze on the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: If all that you were saying the other day,
you were smoking some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect from the Piff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's most good to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's one of those subtle turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got subtle terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokes good down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has it still kind of has a ceiling
compared to some hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke some of the hazes that,
you know, they just kick you, kick you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely see the OGs and the hazes
coming back for the smokers, people that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like the heavy smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sourdain, they're tired of all the cookie,
you know, whatever the cookie crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just ingregated, degraded or like the
purple punch.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this doesn't get you high like
we want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wouldn't be I wouldn't be too
upset if cookies made to come back to you
[SPEAKER_00]: like the real real cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some crosses with cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a cookie hater at all,
but it's just the real cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got watered down diet cookies,
diet skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it's just it's real crazy to
see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, oh, this is cookie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, no, this isn't this is not cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the real original when it first
started coming around was just the cut
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut fishing has been so rampant over
the last 10 years, especially with so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, especially nurseries
wanting to sell stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, not all of them,
you know, there's good nurseries and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries, but there's been a lot of cut
fishing and other problems like seed
[SPEAKER_00]: junkie selling wedding cake seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got 30 different phenos
because there's a lot of different I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's literally 30 different expressions
of of wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's there's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maybe a few good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's that one cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a lot of people put out the separate
cuts and they or the best cut for
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a practice in Cali forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, since 1960.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's that's
what's been going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to get those real cuts and to actually
breed with those real cuts is important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something I strive to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as like the genetics,
you talked about green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else were you working with back
in the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys had some hazes, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was just messing around making
seeds, I was just making it for myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I had a super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the original like purple urkel,
the one that would turn solid purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were real small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The super silver haze had that one big
cola.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was just trying to learn,
you know, really how to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really put any of those out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the super silver, like it burns your
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where you actually like literally the
thiles burn your nose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always thought, oh, this plant is so
funny because I got it right when I first
[SPEAKER_07]: started growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I learned a lot since then.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would think I always thought the
plant sucked because it had the main cola
[SPEAKER_07]: and like I didn't have a proper
environment room to mold the main cold
[SPEAKER_07]: mold every time I like cut it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, it was good smoke around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, man, it's plant molds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It knows this is actually my fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, better grower is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, is this funny stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: Learning stuff like that along the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just trial and error.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've done a lot of trial and
error and I think that's the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best way to learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like a lot of people get almost
bombarded with the amount of information
[SPEAKER_07]: that's out there nowadays.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and so crazy, you know,
the last 20 years, how much has changed
[SPEAKER_07]: going from no information like when we
started doing the B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, making rosin and stuff, not rosin,
but wax.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there was you couldn't look up a
YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was nowhere to find any information.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the first time it came out was
like in high times, like oh five.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that's when people started trying
to blow themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, yeah, I think Kay from Tri-Comp
Technologies wrote a paper about butane
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he was the first kind of slowly
caught on after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was like early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were doing it on the under.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like and then it was like wax,
butter, wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of bubble hash back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely the bubble hash,
all that all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's people I still see people
making some really good bubble hash
[SPEAKER_07]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I love bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love I love the taste of all
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like putting in my joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, you know, I mean, the same thing
with sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some amazing sift here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I love good dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I always use the trim bins.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you know, get when I was doing
seeds, we always see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had a 50 lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing seeds and we always use the
trim bins for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would end up with big, huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the ice cream or the gelato
containers, the clear ones with the black
[SPEAKER_00]: tops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put them in there and then I'd cure
them out and then put them in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out these awesome blocks of sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the auto flower like the auto flower
sift was phenomenal, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're getting a mix of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting you're getting everything
with the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't really can't take clones of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but the more generations you have and
the more stable they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more even the profile is, the less
muddled it becomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to actually really breed them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I tell people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, you got to just don't buy
autos off anybody, you know, that they're
[SPEAKER_07]: just starting to don't understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you take two autos out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are good autos, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make amazing autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of people that make
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I see a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think E.M.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeds, he makes some really, really nice
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, if you take even if you
take two autos and you breed those
[SPEAKER_00]: together, that doesn't mean you're going
to get good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do some refinement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do a couple of generations of
work at the very least.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of work that goes into the
into breeding autos.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see that there's a come a long ways to
it from when they first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first came out now and like a lot
of people that really put the work into.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are just like,
no, they hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated autos and Mephisto changed all
that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big ups to Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really they paved the way for the
rest of us that are making good
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't for Mephisto, Tim and Mitch
killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be here today without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the autoflow world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people don't give them the
proper credit they deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the autoflowers in Europe back in
the early 2000s, 2010, even 2012,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were mediocre at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've they've changed so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole European scene has changed with
autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like good smokeable products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's still an easy plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoflowers are easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something, if you want to grow
something outside and you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: experience or you want to grow something
like you even put one in your window still
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So something like that, I see people.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a misconception.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that it's easier to grow than
a regular photo period in a tent.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like that's just I don't feel like
that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like photo period is almost easier,
you know, to to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know more what's going on than
autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've I've never grown really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've grown like maybe one autoflowers one
time by accident.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just don't see like everybody says
that there's all these it grows faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does this and I just don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it definitely is more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the thing is, is like if you even
look at the seed start a week later when
[SPEAKER_00]: you basically germinate it like if you
don't transplant it right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get root bound right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are real vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a smaller basically the root
ball is so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically a lot smaller than a photo
period plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're getting a taproot with it as
opposed to typically if you're clone
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like it I think autos are
really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you it's fairly you follow
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out really good for somebody
who's a novice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But photo periods are also great for
novices, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer 20 hours of light with my
autoflowers indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I get the best results giving
them 20 with four hours of sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 20 light whereas darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then same thing with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get way more seeds when I do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like significant significantly more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 20, 20 hours on 20 hours on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to love that electrical bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yeah, I was thinking like 20
hours on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for that's a long time that
doubling your bill there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doubling up on the bill, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But back to this no beef, you know,
it has a really unique smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gasman is the one that actually bred it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he he gave me the his cut and and the
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've I've made the f2s and we're
working together, you know, to make a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a ZQ and a meat breath.
[SPEAKER_07]: A cookie dominant dominant male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was ZQ is a cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it dumps really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five percent, four to five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it comes out really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought some we could try it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also brought the second place dab
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the seventh place eco clash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ZQ is all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I never really liked the ZQ was
smaller and I didn't really like the
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that has skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most interesting thing when you
breed Skittles with something you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need to smell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look for the shittiest plants in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in Skittles, you know, it's like,
you know, I mean, he did a really good job
[SPEAKER_07]: because the plant is nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's very vigorous the way it
grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got nice big buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super frosty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, show your picture of this is
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it smokes good and it and it presses
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made about 30 crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're hunting through those and
getting those out to to the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it candy still or where is the?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would say it's like a little bit of
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, in the flavor, you could taste
it in the back back end.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's more like really gassy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real gassy and it has a really
distinct its own kind of some kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say it's like a white
truffle flavor because it's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's but it has that gas and I don't
really like white truffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the the the turps on it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have the ruffles with its white
truffle mixed with Skittles again,
[SPEAKER_07]: of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it came out amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a can of research.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Fresh Coast collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Snowbeef, do you know where you got the
name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I think of Snowbeef,
I think of Wagyu from Japan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's that's well, this strain was
originally named Wagyu, Wagyu with a Z.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wagyu never puts the Z on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a wagyu.
[SPEAKER_07]: And but this particular feno that we have,
he named Snowbeef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has it just has this special turp
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe Snowbeef comes from
Hokkaido.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cold region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is some of the best wagyu in the
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he's going for.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're coming for that top spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only Wagyu, it's the best wagyu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's why we want to have the
best turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to have the strongest turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to have the best stuff in the jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're coming, you know, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing we're working together to make
that happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he's he's on the top of his his
game and making the rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get the the proper results back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what this press that what it smells
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, without any, you know,
having to mess to find a good guy that's
[SPEAKER_07]: making rosin that I could give my product
to and and trust him and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known him for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's and we both have the same
goals to make the best product possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm not looking to get the most
out of my plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking to get the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really what we base everything
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we wanted to we wanted to dump to
eventually.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's like the last right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going for the turps
quality over quantity all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can get it to dump, at the same
time, that's that's all the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's I'm excited for what we got
coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with all with all the strains,
you know, I have a lot of a lot of good
[SPEAKER_07]: cuts that I got.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm lucky enough to to got to
have been able to meet and get cuts from
[SPEAKER_07]: like HBK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he's made like the chili verde
and I still have his chili verde skittles
[SPEAKER_07]: actually that he gifted me before he went
to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was lucky enough to meet him and
I've gotten a lot of cuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: From him, like I got the real papaya,
real dual papaya from him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, actually, you know, we became
really good friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I got his greenhouse before he
actually went, you know, that's another
[SPEAKER_00]: one that's been renamed a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real papaya is so fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just so lucky to get it from him
extract wise, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those extract smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see it named other things like
I'm like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's very unique and really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, you know, it's still still one of
my favorites and it's been popular for
[SPEAKER_07]: four or five years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a lot of brands with papaya in
their extract lineup, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It washes well and it fucking smokes
amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the original, original,
original one doesn't really wash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when I, you know, it came out
probably like two, three percent at the
[SPEAKER_07]: best, you know, and everybody's like,
oh, papaya is a five percent washer when
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just really not the real,
real deal one, the pink hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you know when you got it because
it's got the F1 pink hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and a lot of people crossed it
because it just doesn't press well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like 40 percent in the
press.
[SPEAKER_07]: We lost, you know, we lose.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like for the real deal one.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you cross it and you know,
and you know, a lot of people have crossed
[SPEAKER_07]: it and it and it dumps.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: It does dump more.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're losing that turp.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're losing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to really hunt it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're hunting it for the percentage and
need to be hunting it for the better
[SPEAKER_07]: percentage with the turp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Without taking the turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With papaya, it tastes like papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real papaya flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just mixed it with my strawberries.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out of testing right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The strawberry feno I have is it's green
crack, dosito, cherry pie and gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that sweet thing from archives.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just lucky enough to find a feno
that smells like real strawberries,
[SPEAKER_07]: like freshly picked strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find like specific berries,
especially strawberry, like a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: berries are lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the raspberry boogies and the loud
berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like berries.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like an all around berry smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: But to get a specific smell in there is
like I've been real lucky to to look for
[SPEAKER_07]: those and to find them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I have a rotten peaches.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just pure peach, peach candy to like
almost like burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has the burnt rubber in there from the
gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and same thing with the rotten
pineapples there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just sisters.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're just two fenos I've
named differently from the different ways
[SPEAKER_07]: they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that comes from the pie maker
fenos or they're just it's a special
[SPEAKER_07]: plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, every feno is really good and
really different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of them, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to start smoking on?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I got the I got the first
place or the second place at the dab right
[SPEAKER_07]: competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tractor fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
The.
[SPEAKER_07]: The gas man entered.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't grow them or have anything to do
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I didn't grow them or have anything
to do with breeding them or anything like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just him.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just him entering, entering stuff
that he wanted me to bring in and show you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys some some fire that we're going to be
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a special message for our
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, the best season down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be pretty boppity.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's no beef.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had that in the fridge for about
a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real fire gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stir it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it a good stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth and pine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like the gassiness of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, this reminds me of like
original Oji Kush gas super terpy like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of the cold starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold starts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get you a real dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said cold starts are for girls.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old people and women.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're my biggest fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rent space in your head for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: The mean streets of Instagram is pretty
you on a smaller dab, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
Yeah.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like taking small dabs so I can take a
bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather take something like this size
and take five or 10 dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially when it's this type of
quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need a huge dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you really can tell the difference of
the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially taking a huge faddle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's all red hot, rethink what you're
doing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No less than 800 degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need this up real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the man torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the I feel like the best way to
take a dab is the dab right with the turp
[SPEAKER_07]: slurper is is by far my favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just let's I mean, I took a lot of dabs
a lot of ways, and I feel like this is the
[SPEAKER_07]: best way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I let it get really let it
get down a ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'd like to take them colder,
too, but I don't like to take cold starts
[SPEAKER_07]: because I feel like cold starts are almost
hotter than.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I what I like to dab at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I go three seventy five to four
hundred.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real cold where it's not like sizzling
when you put it in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it to just the melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the beauty of it is so smooth,
it doesn't make you cough at all and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get full flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, it's full flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He does an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he's he's showed me his whole
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the I get to go there with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're making this stuff together and a
super nice cool guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's definitely going to make his mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's already made a mark in the industry,
but I got a I know he's going to he's
[SPEAKER_07]: going places second place.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, once you try that that tractor
feel, I forget who who made it or the
[SPEAKER_07]: cross on it right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really want to try the tractor
feel sexually DMT.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got you on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I started out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took LSD 10 times before I smoked weed
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran cross country in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't want to fuck my lungs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, this little paper can't
fuck my lungs up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, 10 times later,
I'll take the devs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I started smoking weed after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in California, like yourself,
there's access to really good weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's I got really lucky early on,
able to to find a guy that was really.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had the best stuff, you know, and I got I
got a good name of of.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, having the best best weed around
because of them, you know, and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you show up, oh, you got the best
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then it's like somebody else do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really, really got me thinking,
you know, who's growing this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a big secret back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know where the seeds come from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember getting the bag of weed and
just praying that there's a seed bag seed
[SPEAKER_07]: in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like there we had no access like
we do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like he's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were always great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they were always great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's you know, you get a really fire
sack of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're never going to see the
weed again.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so much good weed came and gone
like so fast, like the face of the purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: So many good purples.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all the cushions, like all the
faces of cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The master Kush was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the real old school master Hindu Kush
that was called the camera and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nickname for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was an HK and it was super,
super, super fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like the typical stuff that you'd see
in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was super special.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss all the old strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the new ones, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some really great new
ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of really good stuff like,
you know, it's always good when you hear
[SPEAKER_07]: the hype strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always you know, you hear you see the
purple punch and then you see,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, Oreos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're like, OK, what's next?
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's probably apples and bananas?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it going to be another dud?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get in, you're like,
oh, shit, this is actually really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, finally, you know, this is
actually a good a good hype stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some really good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really, you know,
average ones, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to love the mustache.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thinking baby devs.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really like dabbing, you know,
fell in love with with dabbing and making
[SPEAKER_07]: dabs and yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just got out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I focused more on breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and let let those guys really
take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experts, you know, that's the beauty of
the current scene is you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you grow and have a company,
you really become a specialist in what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hire people that are good at what
they're good at and everybody works
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistically together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's like this podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Ryan behind the cameras and we got
Ben helping out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, your setup here is is next
level.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really impressed with with everything
you guys are doing here, especially the
[SPEAKER_07]: grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I see that you guys are going to
do here is just going to be next level.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's it's exciting to see,
you know, the work that's going into and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a lot of work, but it's a lot
of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I'm just blessed to be
here doing what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to go with the some.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this ruffles ruffles or the was the
tractor fuel?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the track your fuel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you guys check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he does a really good job on does all
the all the logos and everything himself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has got second place at the dab
right competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a quarter of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially I can tell you this one's
strong just by the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some power to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's definitely stronger.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I could remember who who bred it
and the crosses that were on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure I can I can find out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, perpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get good turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely has the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost like, you know, you want it to
transfer over.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one almost transfers over more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the smell, I feel like into the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the that's when you got stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you're looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it tastes better than it smells,
you're on to something.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time you've done dabs on the on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were the first with the dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we got some we got some
episodes coming up or we'll definitely be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to bring it like, like I said,
Gassman's really good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We plan on doing a lot of work together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I really like a step.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best flavor I've had in a dab
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells unique, but it tastes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tastes super good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes better than it smells.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like, you know, stronger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells very good, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and it's got this nice floral
character along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laurel profile, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got like a little bit of
sweetness and a little bit of floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, almost there's a little
soapiness to it, too, like in a good way,
[SPEAKER_00]: not like it reminds me of like childhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinion on the sprayed turps?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that's like a East Coast
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like we don't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the TACA, those snowballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen the snow cap
or the snowballs where they they shake the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag and put it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They they're putting the the weed in a
bubble bag with dry ice totally and
[SPEAKER_07]: shaking it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like a thing there for a little
bit, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's back in full force.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's back in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand why you can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's not that hard just to make this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the basics of it, you know,
these guys have refined, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: certain temperatures, certain everything,
you know, it's real special to be getting
[SPEAKER_07]: it this good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the basics of it is better than
sticking dry ice in a bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't I don't agree with a lot of weird
stuff on the mean streets of Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people want to create a
product that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're willing to sacrifice quality
for one thing or they have inferior
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and so they want to make their
product better in their opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: More marketable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like just just make better products,
you know, just better products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do better for everybody, including
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's just do better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're striving out here to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the right mentality, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to teach, you know, that's why I
really want to, you know, teach the new
[SPEAKER_07]: people that are growing, you know,
the right way about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And kind of the older way, I guess you
would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really promote the home growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't can't really say it enough that
home growing is very important and
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody should be doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, making your seeds and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think home growing is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think do whatever you're passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think the world's a
better place if you do what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing what you're meant to be
doing here, I think it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's awesome to be able to do what
you, you know, really want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I feel really blessed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I got to shout out, you know,
my wife and and everybody that holds it
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we got to we got a good
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Business going here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, she's I'm not computer
smart or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like behind the scenes
stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, she came up with the logos and
like what to do type of stuff and nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of help.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm not doing it just all by
myself, but no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start getting stuff, it's not
it's a team effort on so many levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people see the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see what I do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fucking fully team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of important
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, fill the gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as you grow with everything,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I love working as a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I mean, I know that I can't do it
all by myself, but I love when the team
[SPEAKER_00]: comes together and like you're a fine tune
machine and stuff happens and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's ebbs and flows with
everything, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, team works everything.

support on Instagram and working with a

well.

roof, though, like if you were to look at
