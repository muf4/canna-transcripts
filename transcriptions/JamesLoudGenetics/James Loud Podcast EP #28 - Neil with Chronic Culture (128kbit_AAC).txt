[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is Neil from Chronic
Culture in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil's part of a lot of other things,
but chronic culture is the main main thing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing, Neil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chronic Culture, tell us a little bit
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so Chronic Culture was started about
a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a events media and consulting
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're based out of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a cool little spot in downtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are pretty much the producers of a few
events around mainly the Trans Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: Challenge coming up here, the finals next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got you host all kinds of
awesome events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like it's a multi use space because
I've gone to three or four different
[SPEAKER_00]: events now, I think there and you cook
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make these awesome smash burgers,
maybe the best smash burger I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's big for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the trick with the smash
burger is that you got to eat them really
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fresh right when they come off,
when they're crispy, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably made a couple thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we have this really cool spot in
downtown San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our office headquarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of times a month,
we open it up so people to come in and we
[SPEAKER_01]: throw different types of events.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing these really cool panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually just started a membership club
there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's open a couple of days a week for
people to come by, use the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always have a bunch of really cool
special guests coming by just to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: like phenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, kind of the newest stuff
and just stoked people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've totally had some of our podcast
guests there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, the professional joint roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there for something a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just had Flora Flame down
there for a living soil event.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did a living soil panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Chris from Flora and Flame.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Eli from Moon Valley and Joe from
Snowtail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of all the people,
at least in the Bay Area, that's Bay Area
[SPEAKER_01]: centric, who are kind of, you know,
known for kind of killing it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on living soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just busted out, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've seen a lot of really great
living soil weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of people who talk
different controversies against it and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, am I saying it's like the
weed that I want to smoke all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I enjoy it, but I enjoy smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said before we were talking,
you know, you showed us some stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: was soil based.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was pretty good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's kind of just, you know,
I really appreciate like the sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: farming methods that they use and stuff
like that, you know, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the ecosystem and, you know,
just being kind of like that pureness of
[SPEAKER_01]: the living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, as long as it smells good and
tastes good, that's what really matters to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like as long as it smells good,
tastes good, has a good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The living soil stuff, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys go in no till living soil,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like at the end of the day,
as long as it tastes amazing, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I like eating organic
vegetables and I like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, a lot of I think a lot of
people are, you know, the thing that I see
[SPEAKER_01]: with the living soil is one of the stuff
that I think it's missing from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the salty weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sticky, it's blingy, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a lot of trouble finding sticky
weed these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, back in the day, where's the
football?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like, I can't really find
that anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the champagne back in the day,
it was always the stickiest is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff, you could take a bud and you
could stick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember we used to stick it on the
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would stick it to the window and it
would stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see bud like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the best stuff, you really,
it's very rare that you would find
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's that sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like once the facility started
going over a hundred lights and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: really big and obviously there's,
you know, the ability to have to stay cost
[SPEAKER_01]: conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, where are you at with
where the nutrients are these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what is your desired input?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's a bunch of good
stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think like cutting edge makes
some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super happy with cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frontline, they make some good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as far as like for salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm totally okay with salt grown and
cocoa, if you do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Synganic guys that are
going Synganic, I think that's awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think flushing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's all those different things,
not pushing your plants too hard to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a huge yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that that takes away
from the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the fad that was about
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago, everybody just started
pumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pump and pump and pump and their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go, I'd go into some of these
facilities is, you know, I've been in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of places and I mean, man,
you would see things like the size of your
[SPEAKER_01]: arm and you'd be bragging about five
pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just look at it and you should be
like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just looks really hard to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, if you do the math,
you know, if you get $2,000 on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pound and a half light weed
versus, you know, a thousand bucks on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, three pounds of weed,
it's less weed easier to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of don't really understand where
some of these people's heads are,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some of those facilities that I've
seen that were kind of moving in that
[SPEAKER_01]: direction, I've kind of steered back
because I think that was kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect that was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really hard for them to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just too much weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people dropped off because
they couldn't grow good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just that because there was
some really great facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like their Congo is some of the
best I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we, when I was over there,
we were doing a really great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Congo is obviously one of the
favorite markets, you know, we had a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of other genetics that we were always
playing with because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my philosophy is when you're a brand,
it's not, obviously there's some strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that define you, but, you know,
play around, look, you know, search,
[SPEAKER_01]: always, you know, hunting, always look for
different things and always let the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers kind of give you the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's an interesting market
because we're still in that phase where we
[SPEAKER_00]: got the top forties, you know,
where it's like, like the music industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get your top forties, what's popular
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then leaning towards also having some
stable varieties and staples that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the guys that are producing Skittles
on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one that I don't see that
going away anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see OG become a staple
again for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sour diesel is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh, Josh Freeman is doing some sour work
and I feel like we need to get him into
[SPEAKER_00]: metric and get that sour on a regular
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the world needs things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I was doing some buying for
dispensaries, you know, as the 2018 kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, came in and the switch,
you know, there were still those brands
[SPEAKER_01]: that had that, but now it's kind of like
garnered over to like, you kind of see it
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently with a lot of the outdoor
brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of keep that in their rotation
and do some sort of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the indoor people, not so much,
I think mainly just because of the timing
[SPEAKER_01]: on it, but you know, you have,
you have those select few people that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think, you know, are still look,
are still looking for that, finding it
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, trying to grow that and
bring it to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause again, like, I just really feel
like, you know, I've been to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities and obviously when you go
there, you have the lemon cherries and the
[SPEAKER_01]: runs and stuff like that to kind of what
keeps people going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're a brand, you have the
ability to have variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to a buyer, you know,
if they like your brand, if they like what
[SPEAKER_01]: you have, they're going to buy more than
just the two strains that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully they're not just all lemon
cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people just rename stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it this, but it's really a lemon
cherry gelato runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I get man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get part of it these days is about
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about what your bag looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about what your brand looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, it's a heavy part for sure these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, what is marketing is one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get people to pick up the bag,
but we'll get them to continually buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, time will tell with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I kind of have this philosophy
that when you're working with a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary, you kind of have three,
three, if you can sell it into them,
[SPEAKER_01]: into the store three times, then you're
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means, you know, it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't place a third order,
then hey, move on, go to the next,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to readjust, try to figure out a
better path forward with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get started with cooking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this, is this just something you've
been passionate about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you go to culinary school?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of like food and like,
you know, experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I think it's really
interesting when you look at a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people out there that I think are the weed
celebrities, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a meal with most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are, they all really like
doing high-end food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all about, I guess it's all
about the Terps, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's definitely,
you know, there, when you have that sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of palette for cannabis, it kind of
translates into food as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to have a certain amount of money
to be able to afford the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advanced palette too.
Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, you know, I think it's harder
for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are expanding,
experimenting more at home than they are
[SPEAKER_01]: at their restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But occasionally it's nice to go out and
check out some of the new, the new places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely felt like, you know,
growing up in San Francisco and being
[SPEAKER_01]: there got super spoiled, not only with
weed, but also with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, after a while I was always
going to all these Michelin star
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurants and I kind of just,
I felt like every time I would go pay $200
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat and I was like not satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like people were just kind of,
making these restaurants just to kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be a part of the fad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on my show, we talk about data
points a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of developing a palette
is data points all over the place,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a cannabis palette or whether
you're a chef and you're trying to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: a palette for that or wine or cigars or
whatever it is, it's all about collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this huge collection of
experiences that we've had since
[SPEAKER_00]: childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like that kind of is where
the, the tie comes in and the appreciation
[SPEAKER_00]: for quality as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got guys that love good cannabis that
also love good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we've collected these data
points and we understand what good food
[SPEAKER_00]: and bad food and good flavor and bad
flavor and what works together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, it's all these combinations of
different nuances that makes, make
[SPEAKER_00]: everything so special.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking actually about that a
little before we started, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on like good cannabis and like,
you know, is there, you know, have you
[SPEAKER_01]: ever had really had bad weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, me growing up in San
Francisco, you know, starting to smoke at
[SPEAKER_01]: like 15 years old, there's always good
weed around every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we would have a guy down the walk
you go to, you know, you're on the door,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd be like, Hey, I want to ask the past
announcer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty spoiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never was never like smoking hay or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were telling me definitely since
the sixties in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but I saw the hay weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the brown weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm in the, I was in the East Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not that far away from San Francisco,
but I saw the, you know, the pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bammer weed that was loaded with seeds in
it for Mexico that was like hard pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, like soda water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is what they used sugar and soda
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's different ways to do it,
but yeah, that was one of the ways they
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed that brick weed was they put it in
a tarp and then pressed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they got huge bales.
[SPEAKER_01]: You started smoking a little bit before
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, I've seen that before, but never
was never really wanting to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'll just go to the guy down
the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: $400 a pound back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: $400 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would it cost now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild, but you know,
cause we had outdoor that was going for
[SPEAKER_00]: less than that a couple of years ago that
was actually pretty good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it'll be pretty interesting to
see, you know, harvest season,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's October right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think a lot less people
planted this year, but I've definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: been hearing the people that have planted,
you know, other people that have stayed
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of, you know, been there and I
think the quality is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll have more quality and a lot
of the people that didn't plant it
[SPEAKER_00]: probably shouldn't have planted anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of more people are obviously
going towards fresh frozen as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with the rosin movement and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rosin carts are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite rosin cart right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So jetty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know the guys from
jetty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a rosin cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, they have a couple of different
ones, but their cart, I believe it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate came on the show and he gave me one
of the cards and it was just pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Sam from rosin tech, he has a,
they have, they have a pen that came in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their pen is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even had them in a Arcada X.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried a couple of their pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just swept the animal cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their stuff's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones from rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ABVs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What flavor is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know, but it tastes super
gassy and delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got over COVID about three
weeks ago, two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your wife just got COVID a couple
of days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but she'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's luckily not as bad as it used to be
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot of aches, a lot of pains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just like kind of just have
to chill and sit in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime that happens, I just stop
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime I get sick, I stop smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of friends who power through
it and it makes them sick for,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it makes them sick for longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, they can't put it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's like, I think they're,
you know, obviously weed is not addictive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I definitely think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, switching over to edibles or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not really into edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give me the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I don't like them every once
in a while, but it's just not my
[SPEAKER_00]: day-to-day sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like edibles do a different thing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get me super paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get me ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's like, Oh, I'm a big dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you can probably take like,
you know, 500 milligrams of edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the small little girls that eat 500
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like five, five, 10 milligrams is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to, we never counted milligrams
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd make these super strong brownies
or super strong, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, you'd probably be
eating two or 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I ate a brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great story.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I ate a brownie, you know,
obviously we didn't know what was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sitting there and I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just start getting super
paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, this is when I was
like selling weed and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were, I had packs and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh shit, the FBI is coming
to get me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a knock on the door and it was a
dude that I sold a lot of weed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brings a new guy over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy starts asking me some
questions and I just freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, yo dude, are you a cop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Freak out my buddy who I've been selling
weed with for five years, just looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: me like, dude, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally I tell him what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice guy takes the guy away,
helps me get all the weed out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house, brings it over his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, just chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally took me two days to become a
cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, well, cause back in the,
I mean, you had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have been a 1500 milligrams in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the great things
about legalization is the dosing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, this is so huge now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we're so aware of what we're
putting in our bodies to a degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with milligram doses on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now they also have the mixture of
the cannabinoids with the edibles and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, some of them can really use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, even my parents now use
them for sleep and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, they're getting into the
science of all these terpenes and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: affect us like linalol and all these
things that can be relaxing or sedative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your, what's your thoughts on all
the whole Delta eight situation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta nine situation that's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the farm bill is going to change
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm okay with that to a degree,
but like, I think the Delta eight is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I think if you use a good
starting material and you process it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, I think converting a molecule
into Delta eight is okay from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the effects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm saying that we haven't
done enough studies for me to actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that, Oh yeah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the effect, I enjoy the
effect of Delta eight for sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't take it all the time,
but I'm not going to go take ibuprofen or
[SPEAKER_00]: some sleeping pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go eat a Delta eight gummy,
which has sugar in it right before I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes me tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do 25 milligrams or 50 milligrams of
Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I enjoy the Delta eight,
the Delta 10, not so much, but Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can relate to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not experimented with the different
deltas and I'm going to have to now that
[SPEAKER_01]: you there's so many, there's so many THCO,
so many different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like every time they like write
something in, they find a new kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: annoyed to kind of move over to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it, I feel like it's like trying
to beat the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's a little bit of a racket,
but you know, obviously every state isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: legal and you know, there's loopholes that
people try to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I think those things,
you know, like Delta eight, like we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be aware cause it does get
people really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think fully unregulated, I don't
know, um, scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it, I don't think it should
be scheduled necessarily, but I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do schedule everything anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what do you do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with the latest, you know,
recommendation from the DEA to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule two, the schedule three,
I think they're talking about moving to
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think honestly, the move is to
de-schedule, not reschedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, you know, so rescheduling
to three makes it what medical medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, look, there, there's so much
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much, there's so many people
and money that's infused in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that obviously I think even if it does
get de-scheduled, it's not going to like
[SPEAKER_01]: put it on a terrible path moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll open the doors for certain
things that maybe we won't and put a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of roadblocks up for certain
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I'm, I'm, I'm voting on just
completely de-scheduling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if that happened, it'd be,
I think that'd be pretty interesting as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't schedule alcohol or
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're controlled substances,
but they're not scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is where, where I think cannabis
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's a bunch safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot safer than tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot safer than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as for health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I personally, you know,
I'll drink every now and then have some
[SPEAKER_01]: wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to drink, it's cause I'm
going to party and go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, cannabis is pretty,
pretty much my go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we, we all get together, uh,
uh, me and a group of friends and they
[SPEAKER_01]: always bring wine and there's like four of
us and they always leave a glass out for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're like, they know he's just
going to go smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about governor Newsom
vetoing the bill on psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I believe that the way he put it
was is it didn't have enough written in
[SPEAKER_01]: there about, you know, how to properly use
it and how to properly, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate using the word police, but to
manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a certain sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he also vetoed, you know,
the cannabis cafe bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if, if you look at that,
I mean, I think that would be a really
[SPEAKER_01]: great thing, but you know, looking at that
bill with a fine tooth comb, which I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I was super interested in that,
you know, it, it, there needs to be a few
[SPEAKER_01]: things adjusted to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to actually make it viable for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know if people know this,
but you know, the, the person who wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: it, he's, he was writing it with San
Francisco in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you actually looked at San
Francisco's laws and the way that it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's all put together, it's actually
not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think there, there were a
lot of things about it that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I was super in favor of, but a few
things that I think the governor looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was like, Hey, you know,
mainly, and I agree with him, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the smoking indoors and, you know,
I completely understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, we have the rights to be
able to, you know, the, at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: cities have to be able to make those
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, San Francisco has, you know,
lounges that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a private club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a private club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that model could be
converted over to cannabis very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to allow it for
tobacco, why not allow it for whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not crack.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, our specifically,
you know, at, at our, at our office,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when people come in,
it's a private club.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way that we kind of put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the way that we're
going about smoking indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't condone it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super smoky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen nobody smoking there ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, it'll be pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that, you know, I think with all
the bills that are coming up and there was
[SPEAKER_01]: the other bill, you know, at the cannabis
packaging, which I was super happy that
[SPEAKER_01]: got vetoed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people were, I think that
would have put some handcuffs on a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think the governor said
it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to make a lot of these
smaller cannabis brands have to spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of money to rebrand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, which would definitely would have
been, you know, the case, but also it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just like completely changing something
that's already kind of messed up to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to throw another, you know,
I guess coal on the fire there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it would have been terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's dive into your history,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone would love to hear a
little bit about your history,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you got involved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually know the first time I ever got
high was millennium, midnight,
[SPEAKER_01]: new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2000, so 23 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a freshman in, I was a freshman in
high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm a little older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're a little older.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking a little longer, but yeah,
I mean, it's been a long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I definitely smoked weed every day
from probably the age of 15 to 28 and then
[SPEAKER_01]: took a little break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, now I smoke, I don't smoke
every, I don't smoke every day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I probably smoke four or five
days a week, you know, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like to, I like to do it socially
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I'll have my buddy come over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll like see people at the office and
stuff and smoke, but I very rarely kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sit there and smoke myself, but yeah,
so started smoking in 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really fell in love with weed right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just loved everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved the, the taste, the smell,
the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, smoked all throughout high
school, you know, sold a little urban high
[SPEAKER_01]: school to some of my friends and then went
to college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I went to college, I brought a
half pound of weed in a beef jerky bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Lola Marymount in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you went from San Francisco to LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco to LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went there and I was, I was a,
I brought a half pound of weed with me
[SPEAKER_01]: just to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found a friend and started just
like selling some weed to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how it all took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So made good friends with my friend across
the hallway.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually brought weed to sell as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we became friends and sold weed in
college for a little bit and just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: kept in touch with it was something that I
kind of always knew I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it just latches onto you or you
latch onto it, or it's like the symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship that most of us have with the
plant where we just fall in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a part of our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, you know, living in LA,
I wanted to do entertainment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after college I went and I
started working in entertainment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the 2018, I don't,
I don't think you want to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: brother, but I was actually working at
some talent agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a, a personal assistant for Nas the
rapper for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that, which was pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first job out of college was
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I literally, went from my started a
week before I graduated from college.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I literally had got the day off to
graduate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that I went on the road to
like Atlanta and Mississippi and a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of places with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a pretty interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got along really well with him just
basically because I had weed and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey, was he a smoker too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the first day I met him,
I was getting them ready for a vanity fair
[SPEAKER_01]: photo shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: First day and I ring the bell and couldn't
get them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally got them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he comes out, he starts smoking
and I'm like, what are you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like some stuff, some fan throughout
on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, you're not a student.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went in my car and I got some
granddaddy that I actually brought from
[SPEAKER_01]: the hemp center from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought some granddaddy down and I
was like, Hey man, like I got this,
[SPEAKER_01]: like smoke this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, he's like, and it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the night before he was like,
we'll see how long you last.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the first time I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day he was like,
you might last a little longer than I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the San Francisco, dude, that's where
burner guys start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to buy weed at the hemp center and
he was the bud tender there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always remember seeing him behind
there and get weed from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty interesting to see where
it's all come.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all incestuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hemp center, dude, it was one of
the, one of the coolest spots,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a place that you could sit,
you could smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like super close to my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would roll in, they would have,
you know, the, the, the jars with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bulk weed deli stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could buy as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they had the edibles,
everything you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had a place where you could sit
and you could smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was no frills and,
you know, you would look through the
[SPEAKER_01]: window and you see this little ray of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had great weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had, I remember they always had train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always have good platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always had good granddaddy purple
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maui waui.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always kind of, and then they always
had Hawaiian snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had that Hawaiian snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had some, yeah, they totally did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember I was one zero eight four
was my patient number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, after a while you walk in,
you just say your patient number and they
[SPEAKER_01]: let you walk in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that was a dope place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's the thing, you know,
about how it used, I think it used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: at clubs, you know, cause I've had my
medical card since Jesus, 2003,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I very early, I mean,
I had like, you know, Did you get yours in
[SPEAKER_00]: the city or did you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got mine in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was this Russian doctor woman who
would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I paid $400 to get my first
wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember this woman, I would go,
she would like poke you a couple of times
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, Oh, you're a little
overweight, but you need weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you know, so I remember getting
it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I ever went into
a club down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, right there on the brea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I want to say the brea and
Wilshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I remember going up this escalator
and there was like this Latin dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, must've been five feet tall with
like an AK, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The size of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd be like, Oh, a medical card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd go around the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go in, it was like,
I don't know if you ever seen that scene
[SPEAKER_01]: in weeds where she walks in there,
spends me for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it would always would come
back to San Francisco and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: always go to the clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing back in the day,
all the clubs had different weed from
[SPEAKER_01]: different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would go to, you know, grassroots.
[SPEAKER_01]: She would go to the divinity tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would go over to a love shack.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are all these really great
spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember just always really enjoying
buying weed, having fun, going out with my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, that's what kind of was
like, I really want to do this one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, worked in entertainment and
then after entertainment on the 2008,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, crash of the market, I was like living
on my parents' couch and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, I want to be in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I spent my last little
bit of cash that I had and I went to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyer and I took my parents with me and
they were like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably won't get in that much
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of started from there,
uh, you know, got a warehouse with some
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, uh, got a loan from my parents to
start the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, did that, did that for,
you know, growing in warehouses from 2009
[SPEAKER_01]: to about, I mean, still to like up until a
few years ago when I left Gold Seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, those were the days though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and you were a foundational part of
Gold Seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I started it, uh, with a couple,
a couple of people, uh, me and my buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: actually designed the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, Hey, weed's about to
be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I got to get with some people,
I think, cause I can't do this all by
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Hey, it'd be really great to
have somebody because I was selling at all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the one that would go out and do all
the sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, I partnered up with a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we all kind of had different
strengths and mine was, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the club, selling the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the grower and then we had somebody
who was like running the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I was super proud of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, we were one of the first
people to be, uh, you know, on the shelves
[SPEAKER_01]: in San Francisco branded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I would like be super insistent
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as 2018 came, we were one of the
first people that were licensed and ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of when everything broke
loose and we just hit the ground running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, there were a few things that
happen, you know, some things happen that
[SPEAKER_01]: are acts of God and you know, something,
sometimes that happens and you even want
[SPEAKER_01]: to point at people to like act like it's
their fault, even though it was God that
[SPEAKER_01]: that made it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a while, man, you know,
we just weren't getting along as partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that happens in this
industry and in every industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was time for me to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up leaving, but, uh,
let's talk a little bit about gold seal in
[SPEAKER_00]: the red Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was their claim to fame to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, really put them on the map
in San Francisco because not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted to grow a long flowering,
you know, a plant that had an open bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, you know, type product for the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did that come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as red Congo, I would say I have a
love hate relationship with that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, look, from a sales point of view,
very easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't always my smoke because it
was a little bit more racy and something
[SPEAKER_01]: that I didn't really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more of like the indica smoker,
but, um, we were me and my one partner,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we had, uh, a grower that we were
working with, and then we parted ways with
[SPEAKER_01]: him and we needed to find another person
to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we found a gentleman who was
growing red Congo and that was kind of his
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all decided to kind of get
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of took red Congo and,
you know, put it as part of the brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: started moving it around to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was obviously super easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely had a lot of people always just
like talking to me about the strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, like you said, it's a,
it's a 12 week strain and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's, it's, it's super hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and basically what happened was is we
were growing it in one facility and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we built this spaceship facility and then
we brought it over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't translate under that from
like the original kind of like single
[SPEAKER_01]: ended like ghetto facility that was built
that was super dialed just for that
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think you guys had to deal with,
you had a build battle with hop late too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was part of like the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that there was an,
you know, that strain had been kept by the
[SPEAKER_01]: same group of people for like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, you know, hop late and so
prevalent now, but back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of when it all started
creeping up was definitely the hop late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, I think there were a
lot of factors that kind of came into it
[SPEAKER_01]: hop late and for sure being, you know,
something that kind of came in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it got tissue cultured and even after
it got tissue cultured, it was still
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, no, I think it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, it just, again, when you're,
you're moving from a certain type of
[SPEAKER_01]: facility to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I think it was really hard
for some people to make the transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we also had a lot of
things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, uh, we had our power go out and we
were on generators and there was just a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and genetics aren't just plug and
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you can grow one and you
throw something else and it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it takes a couple of times to dial
it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it takes multiple times to
really dial in something, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's longer, which is a taller
plant, longer flowering requires different
[SPEAKER_00]: light, different food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you, when you were,
we were going from having single and like
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 foot ceilings with single ended bulbs
to 25 foot ceilings with double ended
[SPEAKER_01]: bulbs, full CO2, everything, feeding
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think it just dialing that
in was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we had a few things
happen that were actually the effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: God that ended up, you know, destroying a
couple of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but when you do the pure, you know,
for me, it was, we had a good brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of other good strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, we were able to sell our products
in the store regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was of the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, yo dude, don't grow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can sell anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like we're a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get people like it, Hey, busted out once
a year, or let's find an outdoor grower to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll release it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost the best way with something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but when you did the pure math on it,
especially with how cramped we were with
[SPEAKER_01]: how many lights we had and how we had to
produce, because when we went in,
[SPEAKER_01]: we, we went in with all our own money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took all our money and we just had
enough money to get across the finish
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everything went well, nothing always
goes as planned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely a piece of advice
that I would give.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to start a business,
obviously have stuff in reserves,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a couple years would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, accidents happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, uh, you know, there were
certain things that happened with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think were acts of God,
uh, that I'll just kind of chalk it up as
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, I think the demise of the
whole gold till situation was there were
[SPEAKER_01]: just three people that kind of weren't on
the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, my advice for
people out there who are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to start brands, trying to start
companies is find the right partners,
[SPEAKER_01]: get on the same page with them and really
just have goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe you should have diverse
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want someone that does the exact
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find someone that has talents that are a
little bit different than yours and work
[SPEAKER_00]: with them and combine the talents,
you know, create the perfect Voltron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at, if you look at the
way companies or structures, there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, C levels of many different
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because there has to be someone
that's good at many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for us, we were three rowers
who got together and everybody kind of had
[SPEAKER_01]: to find their, what they were good at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't just growing or at least a few
of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sometimes that's hard and
it's hard to like mix together and figure
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely, you know, partnerships are
tough, but, you know, you live and you
[SPEAKER_01]: learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it really gave me a lot,
you know, moving into some of the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: things that I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could give yourself one piece of
advice, you know, the young Neil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's two or three years in the industry,
you know, from your advice now where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have 25 years behind you smoking herb and
experience with the plant, what would that
[SPEAKER_00]: advice be?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two pieces of advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, diversify a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not only just in specifically
cannabis, it's just for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wish I would have taken some of
the money that I had and put it into like
[SPEAKER_01]: a food truck or a couple other businesses
that also provide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back then it was like, you know,
I could take that $40,000 and put up 30
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and make three times that amount of
money that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if I had to go back on it,
I would definitely recommend to diversify.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I would recommend is get a
really good bookkeeper and accountant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super important, especially in these
days, you know, just to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping track of your cash and make sure
you're paying your taxes and making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you understand where your business is
at financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's boring, but it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having your shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically that's what you're
saying is make sure you have your shit
[SPEAKER_00]: together because there's going to be a
time where it's super important,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have all your books all dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I know lawyers and tax advisors
cost money, but in the long run,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll save you money and heartache and
all kinds of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to backtrack and look
later at what you signed or what you
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try piecing together stuff after the fact
is always a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started Chronic Culture,
I was very adamant about having number
[SPEAKER_01]: one, a good bookkeeper, number two,
a really great lawyer who could help us
[SPEAKER_01]: with the setup and you know, it's all been
set up super well with the trademark and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feeling super good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a pretty special spot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking forward to continuing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the new members club that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So $50 a month gets you in and gets you
access to the different events that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: having.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't want to join,
we also have daily memberships if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to come by to some of those events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the rest of the year, we have a
couple of things we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're diversifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do some things outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just shot a really cool documentary
with Wickerson.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did a really cool art show with
him, which we were super happy about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was based around the final weekend of
the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a suite at the concert for the last
day and had a bunch of really cool people
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we filmed a really cool documentary on
it and we're going to do a little viewing
[SPEAKER_01]: party at a theater that's smoke friendly
in San Francisco coming up here in
[SPEAKER_01]: November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about 20 feet from the stage all
three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd actually never been to a Grateful Dead
show, so it was a super trip and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't quite Grateful Dead,
but it's still as close as you can get of
[SPEAKER_00]: an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a good time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were also in a suite, which helped
a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ryan, our producer, he was there one
of the nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally, if you're 20 feet from the
stage, getting back there is almost near
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to stay if you get there from
the time the show starts till the time the
[SPEAKER_00]: show's over if you want to stay in that
same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the drone show they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure everybody was peaking right when
that was all happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have never, I've never even
seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're doing it all the time,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Giants games, they have it and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as genetics, let's dive into
some genetic talk about popular genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and the stuff going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion on all the new stuff
coming out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is going to happen with
the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go into like some of the Dio stuff,
because I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of RS 11 and Zope and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're getting bred into a lot of
different crosses now, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, RS 11, I've seen a few good
representations of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little bit harder and more
finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zope's my favorite one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually been out for the past
couple of years, which is like if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the new wave is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some incredible batches of Zope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really, we were doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped do a breeding project about a
year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my friend, Stray Flame, he did the
cherry kush crosses and I was trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: find some Zope to cross into it and we
couldn't make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I finally got a hold of it and just me
and some friends at a small garden are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just think it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has the look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited to start seeing some of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's less finicky than RS 11,
because I'll be honest, the original
[SPEAKER_00]: batches of RS 11 that were coming out were
super fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best weed I've ever seen in my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as they took the time to grade
every single bud in the bags that were
[SPEAKER_00]: going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is before it hit the whole rec
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before they sold the clone and now
everybody had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was way before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was when the original batches were
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the bag and it almost had a light
pink tint to it and it smelled like ice
[SPEAKER_00]: cream a little bit, but it smelled
sherbert-y, ice cream-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were coming right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like a cold stone when you
opened the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buds were a little bit gassy,
but it had the perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They graded everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some of the most amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were going stagnant with all
the gelato stuff and then that popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only saw a few of those packs from the
early days, but then most of the stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: saw was out of the commercial production
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the Zope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen lately some Zope that's been all
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we were talking about, it's on the
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their inputs, how they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these bigger grows see what's
been coming down from the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you have good genetics
doesn't mean it's going to come out good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important because it's the starting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have good genetics,
you're definitely not going to have good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because you have good genetics,
it doesn't guarantee anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But LA, if we talk about Zope coming out
of LA, I was seeing some Zope coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of LA that was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty sticky, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some pretty sticky Zope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see some of the wizardry basses
and stuff that were coming from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably one of the ones that were
looking that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I've been starting to see a lot of
it recently and some hits and misses,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few of the crosses from Dio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that to start to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine was doing some runs for
him and seeing some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just all different sorts of smells
and things coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dio does a really good job of just
diversifying and working with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's really passionate about it,
really cares about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money comes when you're passionate about
things and I think that's kind of how he
[SPEAKER_01]: rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best way to approach
life in general is do whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing as far as the next
wave of flavors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there's the candy, the candy,
which I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, don't get me wrong, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like smoking that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we were looking at Pif and we were
looking at Black Cuban Haze just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it serves a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its place, I don't know,
on a commercial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about it, but I get excited
about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get excited about bringing back some of
the old things, but I believe blending the
[SPEAKER_00]: old with the new, I think a lot more of
that's going to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to get out of the gelato
phase because what's happened is we've
[SPEAKER_00]: really bottlenecked ourselves into these
gelato crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that there's anything wrong with the
gelato crosses and it's what's popular
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but I think we need to break
away from that a little bit and get into
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other flavors because cannabis
is so diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more diverse than any other plant on
the planet, as far as cultivated plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market isn't necessarily that diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't as diverse as the plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these other different
directions we could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get into more of the
savory stuff a little bit, even though I
[SPEAKER_00]: like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem with the candy and the
desserts and all that stuff, but I do like
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like some of the real heady stuff
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to find some good OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only good OG that I've seen in the
past few years was that I'll give it to
[SPEAKER_01]: Elephant's Growth, although it's super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some really good SFOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian from Vital came down on the show and
he brought me some OG that was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to call Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might call you for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit you up after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a big old smile on his face with
the OG and it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see OG a lot anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a comeback,
but I feel like OG is one of those ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll always be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see Sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, what I feel about Chem 91
and Sour D, and we might not see these
[SPEAKER_00]: things a lot, but what we will see is
these expressions popping up with new
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses and new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I get excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we get a Chem 91 that has that
burnt rubber smell that's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: the market could appreciate?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got my Med card, it was in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2003, 2004, it was all OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had 20 different OGs in some of the
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to live a block away from the spot
and I knew the owner pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an arrogant motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be like, hey man, how are you
doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I got 20 OGs on the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think I feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay bro, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's calm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, if you want to talk OG, the best OGs
I ever had, I lived in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would drive across town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go to Malibu and there was Green
Angel of Malibu.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you ever went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the PCH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we go in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have all the 91 crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 Malibu, Chem, 91 Pyrrhus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was LA where there were fricking tons
of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: More it was like 70, 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember paying $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go there to buy my weed and then
that spot down the corner I used to live
[SPEAKER_01]: from had great OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Used to have the planetary OGs like the
Mars, the Venus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mars was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't find any of that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go to LA, I guarantee you Cali Kush
Farms, Josh DOG, they're doing OGs because
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh has a huge library of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terraform probably has some, just to name
a few guys in LA that have some fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Brothers definitely have some
OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen them in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to them pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working on some OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing some stuff together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the white fire too?
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG Rascal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wi-Fi 43.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the three, the five,
the 43.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 43 is the one that I know the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the Bay, LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some good OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the distributors to bring it to
the dispensaries in San Francisco because
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would sell really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you need the people who are growing
it to put it in the legal bags and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's like with where the market is
at right now, it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with where everything is going,
it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely talked to a lot of friends
lately who are getting super discouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and you were having that conversation,
but I'm just like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling pretty optimistic about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, let's just keep going
forward and let's just- I'm a fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking earlier that probably
together, if we had a restaurant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could make enough money to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing cannabis because I love
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like cooking too, but it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like being part of this special
thing that we're a part of this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in this infancy and we're in this
special time and it's never going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone through these phases,
but this phase, it'll never be quite like
[SPEAKER_00]: this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be different phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be around, but being part of
something so much bigger than we are,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what's special about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what keeps me fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to my friend and he puts it
pretty eloquently.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, we're like in the bottom of the
second, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still got a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I've been with different
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hit down, but I always get back
up and I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we're Giants fans, so we understand
torture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some good years with the Giants and
same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had good years and this is a bad
year maybe for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you look at COVID was a really good
year for most of the people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not so far off from that time and
everything that's saying this too shall
[SPEAKER_00]: pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that a lot by my father as a
kid, but he didn't tell me about the good
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This too shall pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trip because I feel like everything
goes through waves and we're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: more good times and we're going to have
more bad times and that's just how life is
[SPEAKER_00]: and how life works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about appreciating what we have
in the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just weed, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything cyclical, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's cyclical and I'm fortunate
enough as you already do what I love and
[SPEAKER_01]: have choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not always what happens everywhere
throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're spoiled in a way and we just need
to- We're so blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have options.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think us, we're fortunate enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a lot of people I think in this
industry to where like I was saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: where's the OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, you found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's as blessed and as
fortunate enough to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: In five years, where do you see yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, what a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In five years, 100% still want to be here
doing what I love doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely see getting back into the
consumer packaged goods area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started Chroniculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent many years working with the
dispensaries, getting into the stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something that we're in the
next couple of years going to really start
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to probably within the next
year, really start getting back into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see taking a multi-state and
being able to bring it to a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: different places, being able to bring the
events, being able to bring the brands
[SPEAKER_01]: into some of those places.
[SPEAKER_01]: In five years, I always never really
thought of when I started Gold Till,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like, hey, what's your exit plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't really have one because
I want to continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me now, I think a little bit
more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an exit plan, but in five
years, I really just want to keep building
[SPEAKER_01]: this up and really just keep moving the
culture and industry forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you'd be such a good event
planner for big cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's such a need for good cannabis
events because the industry has grown
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly and it keeps growing,
but there's not a lot of amazing events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the Trans Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Emerald Cup is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a handful of really good events,
but there's always room for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get more into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely really miss working with the
plant though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a grow, which makes me a
little anxious because I've always had
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had such a love for genetics,
so being able to work on that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff with my friends and my time that I
had with Compound and working with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where me and you met.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just learned so much since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I really look at it, I don't think I
want to have another license to where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: having a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd really love to work with a lot of
talented growers and friends that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: and work with them to develop genetics and
just get together to grow some stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm missing and I think where
I'm going to go forward towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fun side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the seed production and the
production side of it, and then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: the fun part like the phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really like weed, phenohunting is
where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenohunting is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through different selections and
then seeing things as you grow them out
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times, seeing how they change,
that's fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a part of so many really great
phenohunts in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We at Chroniculture, a lot of people come
down, bring us a bunch of different stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a look at too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super fortunate to get to look at a bunch
of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to see a lot of
the breeders that have been coming through
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the people that have been
growing their gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more diversity and a lot
more people doing seeds now, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of them probably not in the
best way, but some of them are really
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the time to work on the line and
really make sure that it's up to snuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to be able to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a lot of people and
I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guilty of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made seeds in my basement and just
been like, hey, let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you know, it doesn't always work out
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't always work out great,
but I think I'm a big fan of everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first thing is learn how to be
a good grower and learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: properly because you need to make the
plant express.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on doing real breeding and
you're doing real phenohunts and at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day, you've got to be a good
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend of mine that has asked me
to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, can I grow in my basement
and you teach me how to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, I can, but have you
spent the right money to get your basement
[SPEAKER_01]: all put together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was like, I think with growing,
growing is easy if you have the correct
[SPEAKER_01]: setup and you know- Easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're totally right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like having good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have it in the beginning,
it makes it a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's rules to follow by and the
first one you do is genetics, genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the right ones that work,
that are stable, that work within the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and what you have,
because you might have a cut that works in
[SPEAKER_01]: your basement versus somebody who has a
cut that's in their tent that doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think a lot of growers want to
just grow a different cultivar every time
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get clones of this, clones of that,
but there's something to be said for the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that have been growing the same thing
for three years or five years and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep on making it better each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not one of those, but I like,
I mean, I think a lot of it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are some staples that yes,
we keep around that we do that with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I always am a fan of experimenting,
especially with the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's always like, what's new,
what's new, what's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think hence where we're looking at the,
the bag, you know, the crazy bag
[SPEAKER_01]: generation that happens now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like literally just like lemon
cherries a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like the best bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends who run dispensaries and
they're literally like this one,
[SPEAKER_01]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, cause it just had the best
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that definitely does say
something, you know, and that's part of
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing and, you know, part of cannabis
now is not just, you know, what's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the most important thing,
but you know, again, like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can get people to order your
product three times, you've succeeded
[SPEAKER_01]: because they'll just keep ordering it and
ordering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's a good recipe that
you have to have a good packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: good marketing and a good product to back
because we saw all these celebrities and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to get NOS in on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think having the celebrity is one
aspect of it, but really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got your packaging that people see on
the shelf, but also when they open it,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they come back and they buy it
again.
Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how good the packaging is,
if they're not going to come back and what
[SPEAKER_00]: are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get somebody to pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen a few of these celebrity
brands where they do these big launches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of PR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product sells out really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with the company not so long
ago and we kind of quit working together
[SPEAKER_00]: because the price point wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were worried about getting the
cheapest product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to associate myself with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to a few of them and they're
always like, Hey, we're trying to sell $30
[SPEAKER_01]: ACE, but we're trying to buy the weed for
a thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they wanted to lighten up for
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just put it that because the
brand was going to be so big and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: that and maybe there is truth to the brand
will be so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, you might get this huge launch
and that's great, but if somebody buys it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not going to buy it again,
you're not going to get that repeat sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's price right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's price point and THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you know, branding is
obviously important, but what are your
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts about the THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think, you know, anybody who
comes on this podcast that you're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: going to ask, unless they, you know,
I don't think you're going to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody on here that wouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, it's all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, and literally it, and what
really sucks is I see a lot of extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: talented growers who are growing right now
and they have, they pick their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've literally been there and I've seen
their huge phenol hunts and I've seen some
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing stuff that tests at 25,
but this one tests at 35 and automatically
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to cut that one and go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what they have to do to
save their business, which look,
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand, but it's all about
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this, this topics come up
many times with many people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: To kind of educate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's mainly like with the more
educated market though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at skittles, skittles is
super popular, super amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't test super high test high enough,
but it doesn't test typically above 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I've seen tests around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, let's talk about the rec
market is skittles, super popular in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rec in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super popular to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there's literally James,
we're talking about two different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it literally is something that I
like as opposed to what the world likes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love skittles and I smoke the shit out
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look, are there a lot of people
putting skittles in a bag, straight
[SPEAKER_01]: skittles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people does a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You introduced me to them actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really good job with their
skittles and a lot of it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, depending on how well there's
tests and how well your brand is and how
[SPEAKER_01]: popular you can make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of people doing the
skittles crosses that have been super
[SPEAKER_01]: good, but I don't like diet skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got to, you know, I mean,
I go back to that, but well now in 2027,
[SPEAKER_01]: we won't even be able to get skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have a new skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the name to Z luckily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but you know, it's funny cause like
archive has some good skittle crosses and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are good, you know, the rainbow
belts 2.0 is pretty good, but it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: most skittly, but it's really complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the most skittly and they have
the 3.0 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen the 3.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: My one buddy, Jordan Trinity Associates,
has some, he's going to, he's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully bring me some on Saturday and
I'll check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a Moonbow fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so there's different Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like saying you love Moonbow,
whether, you know, but, but if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Moonbow 75 or Moonbow 112, or I think
there's a 30 something Moonbow that 75 is
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first experience I had was Eric
Goldberg came to a cannabis science
[SPEAKER_00]: conference when I was lecturing there in
2018, I believe with these super crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty buds and we smoked one and I was
like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Oh, it's Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've loved Moonbow ever since I know
Adam from archive and he grows great
[SPEAKER_00]: Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some great Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the, what's the new one they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Izayaki or Izayaki.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to seeing some of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few friends that popped since he's
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard that that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like every, honestly, I've popped a lot
of archive stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really great job because they're
growers and they've worked their lines and
[SPEAKER_01]: they really take the time to make sure
that it, that it, that it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fletch, Fletch has a lot of experience
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think over the years, like you develop a
certain style and they, all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: they've done kind of fits into that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's interested in finding out
where to find more about you or they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to come down to chronic culture,
where would they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to our Instagram, Instagram
chronic culture underscore or the website
[SPEAKER_01]: www.chronicculture.co Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you having me brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you at one of the events soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: My man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
