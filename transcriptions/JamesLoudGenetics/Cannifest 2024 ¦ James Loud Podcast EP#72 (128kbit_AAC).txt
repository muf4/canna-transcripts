So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm James Ladd.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here at Canifest 2024.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in Eureka, California.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a lot of great interviews in store
for you today.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many people.
[SPEAKER_19]: So much great music.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannabis Giants all over the place.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just really blessed to be here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Musical lineups.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Mendo Dope.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Lettuce Tonight.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got O'Teal and Friends.
[SPEAKER_19]: All kinds of great stuff along with all
these interviews.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope you guys enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here day one.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Canifest 2024.
[SPEAKER_19]: First guest of the day is Dylan from Black
Sheep.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: He is the monster of Kovalo growing the
beastly plants How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: I am good, James.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's glorious to wake up and to share our
community and dance and smoke and be
[SPEAKER_16]: happy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, it's great seeing you here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, you know, as we all change
and we come out of this cocoon that we've
[SPEAKER_16]: been in, we're going to be beautiful
butterflies.
[SPEAKER_16]: And here we are in the midst of a very
tumultuous, you know, changing
[SPEAKER_16]: environment.
[SPEAKER_16]: And people are taking time to get off the
hill, come down and enjoy time together
[SPEAKER_16]: and celebrate the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, you're celebrating the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: What did you bring here today to show
everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just blown away by the flower that you
brought.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I've been coming to events like this
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And traditionally we show flowers in
Tupperware and they were cured and it's
[SPEAKER_16]: post dry.
[SPEAKER_16]: And because of this event, and its timing,
I had early flowers and I was able to
[SPEAKER_16]: bring flowers that James gave me on the
podcast back today and show him his living
[SPEAKER_16]: flower that finished in August and with no
tarp.
[SPEAKER_16]: So as the situations change, I think
there's a real solution by us,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, focusing on these early photo
period plants and creating things.
[SPEAKER_16]: So my idea was instead of showing it like
we have typically that I had flowers that
[SPEAKER_16]: were ready early with this being in
September, perfect timing and to bring
[SPEAKER_16]: flowers that are alive.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you got it in water.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a flower like you'd have in a
vase, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you put the little rose horn on here
and you come out and we get to show
[SPEAKER_16]: someone and say, not only is this a
beautiful plant, but this is it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they get the true representation of
the living flowers and it elevates the way
[SPEAKER_16]: that we can connect.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I brought this is one of James
feminized plants and it is amazing with
[SPEAKER_16]: beautiful color, really big nugs.
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like doesn't look like it is
great for extraction because it has open
[SPEAKER_16]: structure and checks a lot of boxes.
[SPEAKER_16]: It checks a lot of boxes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really beautiful tricone production and
fragrant, sharp, sweet notes of rose gas
[SPEAKER_16]: and candy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: On this.
[SPEAKER_16]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love seeing early finishers like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's what it's all about these days.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like especially something that yields and
can produce.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's hard to get those boxes
checked when you want something that
[SPEAKER_19]: finishes early and yields.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just typically doesn't go hand in hand,
but like it's a great example of something
[SPEAKER_19]: that can be produced in an impressive way.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I think that's the most amazing
thing I've seen this year as far as
[SPEAKER_19]: outdoor coming down off the mountain did
great job.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was like, I had to ask James again
to check in because I wasn't sure about
[SPEAKER_16]: cereals or pink animal crackers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I knew that the animal crackers were
chunky with a lot of those crosses,
[SPEAKER_16]: but this isn't even like the biggest
structured nug work.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some are bigger than like football size
nugs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: And out of a 15 gallon pot, I got probably
a four to five pound plant that's 10 to 11
[SPEAKER_16]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Rooted into the earth out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I grew this in straight cocoa.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's something to be said,
I think, for the quality coming out of
[SPEAKER_16]: that cocoa.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big up Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you know them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in there here at this factory.
[SPEAKER_16]: Using their tupper or which product?
[SPEAKER_16]: I use their straight cocoa infused with
Michael Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was so fluffy out the bag.
[SPEAKER_16]: A 15 gallon pot is the most glorious
transplant I ever had where you just slice
[SPEAKER_16]: the bag and dump it in.
[SPEAKER_16]: I filled up like 80 pots in like 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's done versus me dumping it on the
ground, mixing amendments, having a pot
[SPEAKER_16]: up, scoop them up.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And not only do I have this flower,
but my specialty that I'm focusing on now
[SPEAKER_16]: as a breeder is early flowers.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I also have some more strains that I
want to pull out and show the planet.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking pretty.
[SPEAKER_19]: The purple Snapdragon.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that color.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: The subtleties of the color.
[SPEAKER_19]: Beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little leafier than some of the
other varieties.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, I mean that blue.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's almost like a bluish purple
underneath.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: And with these new pitfalls and changes in
the market, I think it's important that
[SPEAKER_16]: all of us farmers consider extracting.
[SPEAKER_16]: And with fresh frozen, you know,
some of these things about leaf or this or
[SPEAKER_16]: that won't be any pitfall.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll, you know, maybe get more of
what's selling or what the people want.
[SPEAKER_16]: So as the market shifts, I'm coming here
to today and being like, how are people
[SPEAKER_16]: consuming the plant?
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we really need to, you know,
pivot as growers and producers to cater to
[SPEAKER_16]: these things.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is another beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_16]: Check out that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I will show that to the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh dude, it's got the most amazing gas too
on there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lemon gas.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's lemon gas, but like the gas.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love, this is the kind of gas I love.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nose burning.
Sharp.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sharp gas.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nose burning.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's like this, we try to coin that term
and it's just, it smells hot.
[SPEAKER_16]: Herb that's really good has this like fire
smell like he's smelling, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I can't get enough of the smell
and there's candy in here too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that candy in a lemon.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the most candy one.
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't even done yet because the
smell's so good.
[SPEAKER_16]: I had to bring it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that beautiful?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like kind of like rank, but rank candy,
dirty candy, dirty candy, dirty candy is a
[SPEAKER_16]: good name.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Please respond to this.
[SPEAKER_16]: We love the idea that we just made a name
on the show.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bravo.
Bravo.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dirty candy, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dirty candy.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can't go wrong with dirty candy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dirty candy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really like this.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're pointing at the dirty candy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Done.
[SPEAKER_16]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Done.
[SPEAKER_16]: What else we got here?
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a cross of one of my skunk
crosses of Fifi, which I just had Julia
[SPEAKER_16]: Carrera write about in skunk magazine.
[SPEAKER_16]: So everybody check it out because I went
on there and the thing that I saw was that
[SPEAKER_16]: a lot of breeders tend to show females.
[SPEAKER_16]: And all the strain reviews were females.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I was like, I'm going to show a dude
and his crab claws.
[SPEAKER_16]: And on Fifi, the skunk that I used,
the crab claws chains are purple.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming out.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that may correlate to color
and influence as well for us, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: doing male selection.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I liked about this plant is the
commercial aspect of it, that the nug
[SPEAKER_16]: structures are all the size that people
want.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a real commercialized kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got nice chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of like gummy gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_16]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's definitely got that sweet fruit on
the nose.
[SPEAKER_16]: And our turps are a little wild.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is my first time trying this.
[SPEAKER_16]: So last night, my friend told me I left
the heater on him from the hotel room and
[SPEAKER_16]: he woke up and he was dying and he was
like, bro, I saved the weed.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he opened it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we kept it going.
[SPEAKER_19]: But when you say gummy bears, this smells
like fucking gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it when it smells like gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the thing is, is we can relate it to
something you've smelled in your past,
[SPEAKER_19]: whether it's candy necklaces, gummy bears,
Oreos, not Oreos, guys, but other good
[SPEAKER_19]: things.
[SPEAKER_19]: You name your favorite candy.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you can get Twizzlers or an actual
smell like that to come out and express,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know you're doing something right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like that's right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Especially look at the structure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: These beautiful chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like as far as the leaf, the density
is nice as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: The leaf ratio is okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's like, like you said, the bud size
is great.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is all seeded like heavily.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see that where I'm like,
me and you make seeds.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's another thing to share with the
world.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really scary for farmers sometimes to
seed their patch or to make too many
[SPEAKER_16]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_16]: But with the extraction route,
that gives us another lane so we can grow
[SPEAKER_16]: seeds, pull the genetics that we need and
then extract the rest and still win.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I encourage people not to take seeding
your crop as a bad thing, but figure out
[SPEAKER_16]: the ways to make it work and share that
seed with the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, bro.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big up to everyone.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bless the planet.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bless the planet.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with Beau from Immaculate Seeds
in St. Louis, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, we're at Canifest.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dude, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a blast at Canifest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're two booths down.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's going to be an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_19]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_19]: Projections.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's going to be great between the
music, the people, the vibes up here in
[SPEAKER_08]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be an amazing event for
sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of good weed going around.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of great weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had Dylan stopping by with fresh plants
that are still alive.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, it's really a fun melting pot
with a little bit of everything and
[SPEAKER_19]: everybody and the mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're here to kill us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're out in the forest,
but they're not too bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just mostly really annoying.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're really bad this morning and
they're going to be really bad this
[SPEAKER_19]: evening.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, like right now, they're not
supposed to be bad, but they're still
[SPEAKER_19]: trying to get me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because we're on camera,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They got to give you a little bit.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: So tell me a little bit about your brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, man, Immaculate Seeds versus
Seabank.
[SPEAKER_08]: We represent a bunch of different breeders
from all across the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really started it out of I felt a
necessity at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been running grow shops for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: The number one question I get after what
lights do I use?
[SPEAKER_08]: What nutrients do I use?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do I get my seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we wanted to use relationships that
I have over my 20 plus years in the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry and be able to provide an easy
way to get genetics for people in Missouri
[SPEAKER_08]: who just went legal at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really when we born.
[SPEAKER_08]: Immaculate Seeds was right at the
inception of medical in the state of
[SPEAKER_08]: Missouri.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going over there with medical?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dude, it's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have recreation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the state's going bonkers.
[SPEAKER_19]: You didn't get rid of your medical,
though.
[SPEAKER_19]: Medical still exists along with rec.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know about these states that are
getting rid of their medical programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's silly.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Medical first.
[SPEAKER_19]: Medical first.
[SPEAKER_19]: And people that are getting it for medical
shouldn't have to pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_19]: People are paying for recreational,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they should not be able to pay the
tax.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be able to go right to the
front of the line, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, schedule three is going to change
all that, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, what's what's hot right now in
Missouri as far as genetics?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, oh, man, I mean, I got to say I got to
call my boy three one four genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, my panel today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, cool, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is crushing the game in St. Louis.
[SPEAKER_08]: He works with one of the best facilities
there like in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what he's being able to bring to the
market, you know, from the legacy days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, bringing it into the market is
really amazing to watch what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to call him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's doing a great job, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: So is this your first time in California?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, no, not at all, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been up here many times throughout
the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've got some great friends up here
and usually come up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to get up here at least once a year
to visit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little gray today, but,
you know, it's beautiful being here with
[SPEAKER_19]: all these donors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Gray and Humboldt is still beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we got people from all over the
country, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Washington, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've met people from Nevada.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure there's people from all over in
every state here.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, well, thank you for coming on,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Quick interview.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll get you on a podcast one of these
days, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd love to have you down.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an open invite.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for having me on today.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with Heston Alcorn, the King of
Oregon, the man, the myth, the legend.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been on the podcast, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm doing well, James.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_20]: Always great to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is my first time down for an event.
[SPEAKER_20]: What a gorgeous spot you guys got down
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we got this fun booth here.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a great event.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of cool people, a lot of OGs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody's passionate for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just a regular in the river like a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was very reggae centric.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is cannabis weed centric.
[SPEAKER_19]: People that are passionate about the
sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a beautiful thing to see so many
people that are in so deep in this area.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're so passionate about it all
together to celebrate at the same time.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no back and forth bickering.
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems like everybody's on the same team
here.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's a beautiful thing to see this
day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we got people from all over the U.S.,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got St. Louis, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got Washington State.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got Texas.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got people from all over.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_20]: As it should be.
[SPEAKER_20]: What an iconic place to celebrate
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: People from all over.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a mecca.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, this is the place, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: So Oakland is definitely an amazing place
that a lot of the stuff was generated out
[SPEAKER_19]: of.
[SPEAKER_19]: But Humboldt, in its own right,
is an epicenter just like Oakland for the
[SPEAKER_19]: outdoor, for the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_19]: The legacy market really exploded up here.
[SPEAKER_19]: 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[SPEAKER_19]: 2010 and even today.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I feel like it's not what it was
in the legacy market, but it's changed and
[SPEAKER_19]: evolved and it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_20]: Their fights changed.
[SPEAKER_20]: And now instead of battling for legality,
they're battling for a fair market and the
[SPEAKER_20]: ability to stay in business up here and
keep those legacy farms alive.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a great thing to see.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's your podcast going?
[SPEAKER_20]: Your show is amazing.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, yeah, the GML show is rolling along.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're building back up after a little
hiatus from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're gearing up for MJBizCon in Las
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're doing Light Wars and we have a booth
down there.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love Light Wars.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm cooking a dinner.
[SPEAKER_20]: Outstanding.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you'll be at the dinner on Thursday
night in Vegas with the Connect community.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have this beautiful surprise that we
got for everybody food-wise.
[SPEAKER_19]: And me being a chef, we're just going to
blow it out of the water and have a lot of
[SPEAKER_19]: fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what else has been on your radar?
[SPEAKER_20]: What genetics did you run this summer?
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm running some random seed gear,
trying to do some hunts from the old
[SPEAKER_20]: school.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to bring back a little bit of
that south of the border flavors,
[SPEAKER_20]: Macapoco gold, Panama red, some of the
longer flowering stuff that no one seems
[SPEAKER_20]: to have the interest or probably patience
for.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's nice to be on my own schedule,
like you said, home grower.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't have a deadline to meet.
[SPEAKER_20]: I can take that 14, 16 weeks if I need to.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's fun to play around with some of
those things that you don't see so often
[SPEAKER_20]: because they are a little bit more
difficult and tough.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's time consuming to produce.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I'm rocking a Malawi times Oaxacan
that I got from a boy German from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's super funky.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got the tropinoline limonene.
[SPEAKER_19]: You could tell it's going to be super
strong psychedelic stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you're speaking my language.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the plant is massive.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I basically manicured it so it looks
like a tree.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's got the exposed limbs on the
bottom and just exploding on the top with
[SPEAKER_19]: colas.
[SPEAKER_19]: How deep into flower is it?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's now probably about two and a half
weeks, which is about two and a half weeks
[SPEAKER_19]: behind everything else I got in flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to make seeds with the selection
that I made.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're crossing it with some really cool
OG stuff, a little OG project I've been
[SPEAKER_19]: working on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, I'm excited to get some OG into
the mix.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, send me those testers.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you need somebody to run them indoors,
I'd be glad to volunteer for that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I will.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I have a ton of land race.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need to have that conversation too.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're interested in running land race,
I got my boy Fritzi from Germany and he's
[SPEAKER_19]: all over India right now collecting land
race genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're going to be doing some real fun
trials.
[SPEAKER_19]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Hit me up.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm definitely down to clown in the land
race game.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you so much for coming on,
dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Great to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on the podcast again.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got to get you down to California.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ready for a trip.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bring the family.
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with Alec from SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today, Alec?
[SPEAKER_19]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's the Canifest going so far for you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing to see the community alive
and bright and resilient.
[SPEAKER_19]: Resilient, happy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love this side of the community,
too.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got the real smokers, the real people,
people like yourself that have been in
[SPEAKER_19]: this for a long time coming out here and
sharing their love for the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love seeing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_14]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like all the realest people that
serve this plant are the coolest people I
[SPEAKER_14]: could ever hope to know and be friends
with, let alone work with, collaborate
[SPEAKER_14]: with.
[SPEAKER_14]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_14]: So how's SC Labs doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a wild ride.
[SPEAKER_14]: 15 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: We opened in 2009, and we're surviving.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's survival mode for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_19]: Myself included.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, it's about setting yourself up
for the future.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've talked about this a little bit
before the interview, and I think it's a
[SPEAKER_19]: beautiful time because I see the future
coming, and I feel like I'm prepared for
[SPEAKER_19]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like companies like yourself,
you guys are prepared for it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many people are very short-sighted,
especially with testing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And testing is such an interesting subject
because a lot of people want to get around
[SPEAKER_19]: testing.
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't feel like there should be as
much oversight.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want more oversight.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want consistency across the board.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to have transparency.
[SPEAKER_19]: And honesty.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is what's going to make the
industry a better place.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm one of the co-founders of SC Labs,
but I'm a culture anthropologist and
[SPEAKER_14]: ethnobotanist and love, study,
appreciation of all people at all times
[SPEAKER_14]: and all places, and attract study of the
medicinal, traditional plants used across
[SPEAKER_14]: cultures and time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Through the lens of analytical chemistry
and testing over the years, I've really
[SPEAKER_14]: learned that it's helped to provide a
language of meaning to be able to
[SPEAKER_14]: understand and interpret this great plant
and all the wonders it offers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then through the testing too,
it's like we're now testing cannabis to a
[SPEAKER_14]: level nothing's ever been tested.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's this great bioaccumulator of the
century.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's through the story of the
bioaccumulation, it's helping to uproot
[SPEAKER_14]: the legacy and the history of the Green
Revolution and the shift from
[SPEAKER_14]: petrochemical nerve agents developed by
Nazi scientists that turn into the modern
[SPEAKER_14]: pesticides in the future.
[SPEAKER_14]: That have poisoned all life and the planet
and our bodies that's leading to all the
[SPEAKER_14]: chronic illness, epidemic, and cancers.
[SPEAKER_14]: The cannabis plant, I feel like,
is helping to bring truth.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like this year particularly,
and going forward, I feel like it's going
[SPEAKER_14]: to be a really good year for those with
integrity, within the integrity of this
[SPEAKER_14]: plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's something about, you can't
grow this plant around agriculture.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like if you look at the GIS overlay
of the state of California and all the
[SPEAKER_14]: prime ag land areas, the green zones,
those are red zones for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good thing Napa Valley prevented
cannabis from growing in that area because
[SPEAKER_14]: it would have exposed that it's toxic
appellation, that you could never grow
[SPEAKER_14]: clean cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: You could pass a test.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well the beauty of cannabis is soil
remediation.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's one of the most amazing things that
I think is overlooked a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_19]: But like, you know, it's a beautiful,
and that's why they probably need to plant
[SPEAKER_19]: it up there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we don't want to smoke that stuff
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go grow rope.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe one day you can come grow some
medicine cultivars.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, clean that soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, you know, they're using it in
places like Chernobyl to remediate up
[SPEAKER_19]: there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's so fascinating because like,
testing kind of placed, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: for public health and safety, you know,
part of a regulated system.
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes it the final check in the
integrity of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when there's integrity in it,
which is now finally coming with this like
[SPEAKER_14]: era of the recalls and the state having
their own labs online where they're
[SPEAKER_14]: testing the testers and, you know,
it's like this, this kind of time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, they failed over the last five
years to do anything, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: In California especially, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially in California.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But now that they're kind of getting in
front of it, it's like there's,
[SPEAKER_14]: I just feel like a great moment of
reckoning.
[SPEAKER_14]: And for those that are of the land and
have taken, been stewards of the land and,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, in regions of like the Emerald
Triangle, it's like, it's like
[SPEAKER_14]: non-poisoned, non-compromised,
you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like the value, the true value
of clean quality herb and ingredients is
[SPEAKER_14]: about to get a value that it hasn't
gotten, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nah, I'm excited for that part of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, there's a lot of people
struggling right now, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_19]: everything goes in waves.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's going to be people struggling
again someday in the future, and it's also
[SPEAKER_19]: going to get better, you know.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like the beauty of an unstable
market.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, you know, like we're pioneers a
lot of us in our own right, trying to
[SPEAKER_19]: figure stuff out for the first time,
you know, whether it's a legal seed
[SPEAKER_19]: company in the United States or laboratory
testing.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Reggie Gadino, he wrote the Ford
for my book and he's an amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, so I tested stuff with Halent
Labs back in the day and I use SC Labs
[SPEAKER_19]: now.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we do testing for our seeds and for our
clones and our genetics through SC.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think you guys do a great job.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that you guys are standardized.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like when I send lab tests or
when I send my plant material for lab
[SPEAKER_19]: tests, I get honest results.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, integrity is obviously a huge
part of that.
[SPEAKER_19]: But so many companies are incentivized to
give higher testing results and that's got
[SPEAKER_19]: to go away.
[SPEAKER_19]: That has to be one of the first things to
go away.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been like horrifying because over the
last five years, you know, there became
[SPEAKER_14]: like economic disincentive for people to
want to work with us, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: that we pride ourselves in accuracy and
precision and being above reproach and
[SPEAKER_14]: helping keep those that we serve above
reproach.
[SPEAKER_14]: But none of that mattered in a state where
you could just guarantee get a 50% result
[SPEAKER_14]: every time from this lab and never fail a
test.
[SPEAKER_14]: So why even test it?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, and so I saw a lab result for
over 50% THC on flour and that's not even
[SPEAKER_19]: possible.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not even close to possible.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's so funny that people would even
have that because you have to know nothing
[SPEAKER_19]: about the plant to have a test like that
and just show it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like I've had bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_19]: We live in this world of misinformation as
well.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's people that they're educated
enough to know about a COA, but they're
[SPEAKER_19]: not educated enough to understand it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, because I think a proper
relation with a lab partner is like it's a
[SPEAKER_14]: partner in solutions to help, you know,
expose where you're at and be able to,
[SPEAKER_14]: through data, help to like bring about
data driven decisions so you can
[SPEAKER_14]: understand how to optimize, how to like
preserve turps, how to standardize the
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabinoid content across your canopy
through like leafing practices,
[SPEAKER_14]: methodically early in flour so that all
sites develop the same, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: because like a lot of labs just,
you know, that started kind of like right
[SPEAKER_14]: as legalization happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: They thought it was this get rich quick
kind of fucking guaranteed testing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, but it's like really quickly
learned.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, you know, and didn't have
integrity to start because it's like if
[SPEAKER_14]: you fail somebody like in this compliance
testing for one better be right,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, and you better be able to
defend, back it up, show all the like work
[SPEAKER_14]: you did to kind of ensure that fails fail.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you're just, somebody has to remit
or destroy thousands, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_14]: thousands of dollars of product.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's the end of the relationship,
you know, based on how it's handled,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so one of the big things we learned
early on is you know, kind of,
[SPEAKER_14]: you can't just auto email that information
to somebody like, you know, that requires
[SPEAKER_14]: one of the founders to come for myself.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you can do anything, but that's
probably not the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, not the best way.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we learned you have to immediately
follow up to engage to both demonstrate
[SPEAKER_14]: the quality and precision of the work and
to be able to then shift into a root cause
[SPEAKER_14]: analysis where you can help kind of
genuinely get to the root and build
[SPEAKER_14]: systems to prevent that from ever
happening again, turn the losses into
[SPEAKER_14]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of our greatest success stories
have been through that helping people to
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of overcome massive obstacles,
you know, whether it was like,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, cause it's like a lot of like
people would just go to whatever lab is
[SPEAKER_14]: going to stroke their ego and tell them
they're crushing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: They might send the same sample to five
different places before they decide who
[SPEAKER_19]: they're going to use, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: But instead of like working with the
quality lab, cause it's like, sure,
[SPEAKER_14]: you have a strain that up top,
sure, could test 30%.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But does everybody test that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Does the compliance, does the average
across the plant?
[SPEAKER_14]: The biggest thing I've learned about
potency variance from like, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: cause people just will go find a lab,
but give them a high number instead of
[SPEAKER_14]: learn the critical nature of canopy
management and leafing methodically at the
[SPEAKER_14]: points that most matter most where the
flower sites are starting to develop and
[SPEAKER_14]: all go to mature together at the same rate
with the same light, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: cause like all of a sudden with that type
of an approach, you know, kind of removing
[SPEAKER_14]: 75% of family for the start of flower and
day 21 and day 56.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like all the buds are top buds.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's like all the bud tests,
but the top of the tests standardizes the,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, so it's like, we've never been
somebody who just strokes somebody's ego,
[SPEAKER_14]: but, but it's like a standardization or
achieving kind of like, uh, like a goal of
[SPEAKER_14]: like all bud testing with a top of test.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can help people get there, you know,
but it's definitely a different approach.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So my company is like a research and
development company.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, yeah, we're genetics, all this
stuff, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_19]: we're researching development because we
want to empower our customers.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like you guys are the same way.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like all of its data collection and
being able to look at data over a long
[SPEAKER_19]: period of time and go, okay, well,
this, we can improve here.
[SPEAKER_19]: This, we can improve here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And how do we improve that?
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the more I figure that out,
I can empower my customers to get better
[SPEAKER_19]: results when they buy my genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, whether it's licensing a genetic
buying seeds for their outdoor crop,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, it's all data driven.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the best companies are really
data driven these days.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in the future, it's going to be even
more important because it's so
[SPEAKER_19]: competitive.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and, and also too, just like
selecting for things beyond THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's where I really appreciate the
diverse offerings you have, but you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: so many, you know, selections you can find
could be like five, 6% Terps, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: The average across hundreds of thousands
of tests of what we've ran over the years
[SPEAKER_14]: is about 1.4%.
[SPEAKER_14]: The average in Dreadflower, the potential
when it's most sticky, chronic,
[SPEAKER_14]: like three to five and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_14]: The average herb on dispensary shelves,
1% or less.
[SPEAKER_14]: The average pre-roll on dispensary shelves
is like half a percent or less.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's like, you know,
and so kind of like on a cool note,
[SPEAKER_14]: like some, some epic, epic farm resilience
we've seen built up from, so a lot of the
[SPEAKER_14]: leaders in Oregon market, like instead of
that, you know, having built and made it
[SPEAKER_14]: build resilience through the most flooded
collapse times, you know, cause they blew
[SPEAKER_14]: up the market first and overproduction
first, you know, kind of totally,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, and they blew it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no limit to the licenses.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just, everybody got licenses.
[SPEAKER_19]: They produced 10 times as much as they
could consume in the first year.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think they really showed the way
forward because it's like, the people I've
[SPEAKER_14]: seen kind of like through the market
collapsing and maturing, like those that
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen succeed and build brands and
loyalty consumer following.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, instead of continuously doubling
down the square footage, if anything,
[SPEAKER_14]: scale back a little bit, double down on
preservation infrastructure to treat herb
[SPEAKER_14]: like lettuce, like cabbage, you know,
keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like a consumable product that you need
to, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm a, in my, my breeding book goes
into detail, Jeremy Marshall and Tony
[SPEAKER_19]: McGee from Logonator.
[SPEAKER_19]: They transported their beer from
Logonators.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were the first ones to start
transporting beer refrigerated from their
[SPEAKER_19]: brewery down to the, so it'd go from their
brewery to wherever it was going,
[SPEAKER_19]: stay refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_19]: The consumer would get a refrigerated beer
that had never been, well, cannabis has to
[SPEAKER_19]: be the same way.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, and these things are so crucial
to getting the best product possible.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's little hiccups in our
industry, you know, and there's little
[SPEAKER_19]: bottlenecks and there's little problems.
[SPEAKER_19]: And these are all things that can be
fixed, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: And it takes data and it takes people with
integrity to be able to fix those things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, thank you so much for coming on
today, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: We're here at Cannifest 2024.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with Mendo Dope, the planters of
the trees, the guys that grow monster
[SPEAKER_19]: ganja plants and perform on stages.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a blast so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love coming out to these places and
seeing all our people, the culture is big.
[SPEAKER_19]: So your set was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: The sound was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I love coming to outdoor venues
where the sound is so good and you guys
[SPEAKER_19]: were so crisp and clean and it's great
having you guys start the day off right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys are our beast back here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The band is next level these days and it's
so much fun playing live and building this
[SPEAKER_06]: really epic sound that we got going.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, it is an epic sound and your
microphone stand is epic.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love the mic stand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to introduce everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so right here we got Mr. Blap,
our drummer right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me let them in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Mr. Blap.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the drummer.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what's up, y'all?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Trevor, playing bass, doing some
vocals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny Fingers, guitar.
[SPEAKER_05]: What up, y'all?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Blizzy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, Canifest 2024.
[SPEAKER_05]: What up, James?
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, so really amazing event.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was excited to see you guys in the
lineup.
[SPEAKER_19]: We wanted Marlon to show up.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was hoping he could perform with you
guys, but he's not here today.
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, he's a good friend of both
of ours and I mean, just the most amazing
[SPEAKER_19]: human.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, we'll have to do that again with
Marlon one of these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the OG Marlon Asher,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been able to work with him for a
long time from the first Planters of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Trees album in 2013 and then bring him
back out for part two, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was epic and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many good songs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many good ones.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So how do you guys feel about Canifest
2024?
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it's been a blast so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, time flies for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we still haven't even got to go out and
check everything out yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a little wandering to do and more
smoking to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are your plants doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you guys grow monster plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys are known for your monster
plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to talk about some plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, like we have like,
let's say our personal garden right now is
[SPEAKER_05]: we can start with those.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Project Power strain that we've
had for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a vigorous big plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have each of us have seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're supposed to do our six legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a seven each of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are trees for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are some of the biggest plants I've
ever had at my house for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're those 10, 12 foot wide,
10 foot tall ones right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And starting to get really crazy budding
going on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this time of year is special because
everything's in full bloom.
[SPEAKER_19]: Typically, maybe some sativas are just
starting to fall.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But smells are there too and anything
that's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the big farm, a lot of cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We even have the fruit loops from James
Loud at the farm, a whole row of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our favorite Fino from last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, super bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indica style growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very easy to manage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't need to be topped or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what's on the agenda for the rest of
the year for you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as of now, a lot of harvesting is
about to start kicking off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to be picking a lot and we
got a couple more things set out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be heading out to Florida for the
Cannabis Festival out there beginning of
[SPEAKER_06]: November.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got a really dope grow class coming
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: In two weeks, we'll be doing the on the
farm grow class.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same weekend, we got Humboldt Seed
Company coming out for a nice epic Fino
[SPEAKER_06]: hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some nice patch of different
flavors with them and some of our special
[SPEAKER_06]: new stuff seed starts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Fino hunting, picking, rocking,
a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you guys for showing up,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you guys for performing all that you
do, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to James Loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Cannabis Fest out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis culture representatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just here so I don't get fined.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with A.C.
[SPEAKER_19]: Moon.
[SPEAKER_19]: She has worked in St. Vincent on and off
for the last eight years.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, we hang out at cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_19]: She yeah, she's a passionate about the
sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: She has some amazing patents.
[SPEAKER_19]: She has a tent.
[SPEAKER_19]: They are not a tent.
[SPEAKER_19]: She has an umbrella that goes over the
plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: You also have a tent too, I believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Crop Top Greenhouse is an instant pop up
portable greenhouse that definitely looks
[SPEAKER_11]: like a tent to some people.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it does look like a tent.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a plant tent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has telescopes from ground level to
about 14 feet tall and is made out of
[SPEAKER_11]: polywoven plastics that we use in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I use that type of greenhouse material
and for the hundred foot greenhouses for
[SPEAKER_11]: like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I chose it in my innovation.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you can telescope it at any point
in time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just put that skirt on and it protects
plants from like ashes or use it as
[SPEAKER_11]: breeding chambers, pest management,
so many different things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now we've got a couple of hippies
hotboxing it, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had some other dudes, you know,
using it for showers out in their
[SPEAKER_11]: groceries.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been all over the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's really fun as a breeding chamber
to make sure that your genetics have their
[SPEAKER_11]: own little private space.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're doing little like home,
you know, you know, hunts or things like
[SPEAKER_11]: that.
[SPEAKER_19]: What is fully breathable too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got some ventilation with some agro
buns type meshing there to make sure that
[SPEAKER_11]: it can be used in pest management and,
you know, breeding and all those good
[SPEAKER_11]: things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: The heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pollen mitigation.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: So how's Canifist for you?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been chill so far.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did the judging last night and so we
were out till, you know, about 12,
[SPEAKER_11]: 12 o'clock, you know, partying down in Old
Town Eureka and smoking a little bit too
[SPEAKER_11]: much.
[SPEAKER_11]: So our morning got off slow.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there such a thing?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when you start making it so you
can't talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: At Reggae on the River, when I seen you,
when you guys were booths up, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: talk for like three weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was hollering.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, yes, Marlon.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just hollering so hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could not talk for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was no podcasting for me at that
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: We just saw Mendo Dope.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just performed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Got to love Daniel Mendo Dope.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those guys are killing it.
[SPEAKER_19]: They sound better than ever.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so cool to see the community
supporting each other so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people that bring music to the table
offer a whole niche of exposure that we
[SPEAKER_11]: don't necessarily have the ability to have
on our own.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this symbiosis of music and
festivals and events really helps
[SPEAKER_11]: entrepreneurs of all forms kind of move
forward a little bit more and kind of get
[SPEAKER_11]: just one more set of eyes on it that may
not have been without that music.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mendo Dope's definitely fucking
culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse my language.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we got Lettuce tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Otile and Friends tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Super special.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Brian Swizzle, I think, is out here,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we got Object Heavy somewhere up in
this bitch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Nicky T's here as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big ups to Nicky T.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's always in the culture, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he's always at the events.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, at least we were at Reggae.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been in it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, seriously.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been burning all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: All day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we're seeing the best of
everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm seeing good indoor, amazing depths,
early finishing flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just all amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's absolutely great because
everybody from the surrounding counties
[SPEAKER_11]: has an opportunity to come, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we see a lot of diversity and like high
elevation growing or, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: base elevation, sea level growing,
indoor, outdoor, like you said.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the depths coming in, the organic
depths for regenerative farming are
[SPEAKER_11]: seriously always my favorite, 100 percent
always my favorite.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it actually brings like this,
you know, you can smell organic,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, when you grow good genetics like
yourself, rare breed and all these other
[SPEAKER_11]: guys that are really putting their heart
and soul into growing good genetics and to
[SPEAKER_11]: grow it organically in a way that is
positive for the earth is 100 percent our
[SPEAKER_11]: mission.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it just tastes better.
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells better.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you do it in depth, when you have
all that pure like midsummer sun at that
[SPEAKER_11]: highest elevation of sun, I think that's
when it comes out the best, honestly.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's definitely some of this special
about the sun.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's hard to argue.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I think there's a lot of guys in
San Francisco, Oakland, big cities.
[SPEAKER_19]: They all want that indoor.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you've never had really amazing
outdoor, you probably don't have anything
[SPEAKER_19]: to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love outdoor in its own way,
just as much as I like indoor and
[SPEAKER_19]: greenhouse mixed light is like amazing,
too.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like it's the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we can argue that all day,
but I feel like greenhouse mixed light is
[SPEAKER_19]: the future.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get the sun, you get the power from
the lights as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you get more of a consistent product.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The consistency is definitely a huge
ordeal.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's so many elemental risks
that we have with outdoor and even
[SPEAKER_11]: greenhouse in a way where, you know,
will you get all of a sudden mashed by a
[SPEAKER_11]: pest, you know, where mold come in?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there going to be a hot day?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there going to be a fire?
[SPEAKER_11]: And all of a sudden your greenhouse is
full of smoke.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's so many different pests.
[SPEAKER_19]: Other neighbors spring.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_19]: Things so you can mitigate by having a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have less variables to work with.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so you have more control.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I love outdoor, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_19]: Outdoor has this place.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't ever want to see outdoor go away.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't ever want to see indoor or
anything else go away.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to see them done as efficiently as
possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Efficiency is a huge thing and earth
friendly.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, more that we can partner up the
concept of organic growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even in an indoor situation where we have
lower wattage uses of LEDs and HVAC
[SPEAKER_11]: systems and things like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The more that we can minimize our carbon
footprint, I think, as an industry and
[SPEAKER_19]: optimize quality, because we don't want I
feel like on one level we want to make
[SPEAKER_19]: stuff that's good for the earth and we
want to do things that are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: But also we don't want to sacrifice
quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of those things, people don't see
them as going hand in hand, but they can
[SPEAKER_19]: go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I think we have to be conscious
about that because any more it's so
[SPEAKER_19]: competitive, you have to have the best
quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it needs to be looked at with
integrity.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, keeping the integrity is like 100%
the real shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you want to grow the truth,
you got to be the truth.
[SPEAKER_19]: Integrity farms, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Integrity!
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah!
America.
[SPEAKER_11]: South Park plug.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got to love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's been your favorite part of
Canifest so far as we bring this community
[SPEAKER_11]: back together?
[SPEAKER_19]: I really liked Mendo Dope this year.
[SPEAKER_19]: This morning, but I love just the group of
people that we have gathered here.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of people I know, a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_19]: But as far as the music, Mendo Dope was
mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought that was great listening to them
open up the day with really good music and
[SPEAKER_19]: they perform really well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, those guys are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yes, seeing Grove bags here.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I like seeing Grove with their
turplocks.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a huge turplock fan.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we've got Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're my cup buddies.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw them at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were with them at Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_19]: Love those guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cutting Edges here.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Skunk Magazine, Rare Breed.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many good brands, so many good people.
[SPEAKER_11]: We even got Grove Magazine laid down
higher than hell in my crop tops right
[SPEAKER_11]: now.
[SPEAKER_11]: The founder guy is asleep in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: He came down from Eugene.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did see someone that got too high that
had to get taken away on a stretcher.
[SPEAKER_19]: She was too lit.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm guessing it was dabs.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have to find out who produced that
product and put it on blast.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Or maybe not.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you just never know.
[SPEAKER_19]: With some people, they're lightweights and
they just can't handle it and they get
[SPEAKER_19]: excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember the people that used to take
edibles and end up in the medical tent
[SPEAKER_19]: back at the old high times events.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a lot of people don't remember that
it has a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you haven't eaten today and you're
going to go get blasted out and smash your
[SPEAKER_11]: face with some dabs or some edibles,
you're going to get way higher than if you
[SPEAKER_11]: ate a full stomach.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes you want to do that,
but that's if you have a tolerance.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to be aware.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think at the end of the day,
awareness is such a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Aware of what cannabis or what different
types of cannabis can do to you because
[SPEAKER_19]: it's so subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can go smoke something that's narcotic
and you want to go to sleep or sedative.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there's some other stimulating
stuff that makes you want to run around
[SPEAKER_19]: and dance.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can go crazy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Between that spectrum, there's so many
things in the mix.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was doing judging for the flowers for
this event for Cannifest.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've normally always been a judge for
Emeril Cup for about 10 years,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I've done Cannifest for two or three
years and have supported them when they
[SPEAKER_11]: did Green Week and Humble Green Week since
2014.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's been really weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had three categories.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had couch lock.
I know.
[SPEAKER_19]: I judged the extract, so I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you saw that there was three
categories.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was party time, couch lock,
and what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_11]: Balanced?
[SPEAKER_11]: Balanced.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so to be able to fit all of the things
that we feel from ingesting or smoking or
[SPEAKER_11]: dabbing a product into those three
categories was a challenge.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like, which one actually fit here?
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a tough time with that a little bit,
but I put them in order of first,
[SPEAKER_19]: second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
eighth, ninth, tenth, one through ten.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went back and forth.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm one of those guys who wants to taste
this versus this and let that soak in and
[SPEAKER_19]: then wake up in the morning, try one.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I went through a real process judging
those extracts.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not usually a rosin judge.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had accidentally given me a rosin
kit, but I enjoy rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: I smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such an important part of what people
are looking for in genetics right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to know what their wash is,
the percentage of the wash, how much
[SPEAKER_11]: trichrome is produced.
[SPEAKER_11]: So really it's a huge market.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a huge thing, but yeah, it's a
concentrated expression of the plant too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is definitely crackweed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I call it crackweed all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are definitely boiling it down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the turps though.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get different turps.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like Donnie Berger is a great example.
[SPEAKER_19]: I talk about it on my show, but like
Donnie Berger, the flower is all right.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: But you turn it into extract and it's
like, wow, that's freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have some really cool crosses that
I'm working on with House of Kultivar and
[SPEAKER_19]: the flower is okay, but you extract it and
you turn it into rosin and it's like,
[SPEAKER_19]: whoa, where did that vanilla come from?
[SPEAKER_19]: Where did this expression come from?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so special and you don't necessarily
get in the flower until it's concentrated.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a lot of people don't know as we
looked at their percentages to create like
[SPEAKER_11]: these wash numbers and a 12 foot tall
plant that extracts an ounce of wash is a
[SPEAKER_11]: different percentile obviously than that
same cultivar at a six foot plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like the wash numbers and
percentages are slightly hard to really
[SPEAKER_11]: define because of those points,
but a lot of cultivars may have more bio
[SPEAKER_11]: waste and more actual carbon material in
them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're looking at trichromes now in a
more scientific way where this is just the
[SPEAKER_11]: sugar on top.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we can take just the sugar,
then we're not having the experience of
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking the chlorophyll or the biomatter,
which I still enjoy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very much a flower girl, an organic,
you know, do me for me, we'll always do
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But these new infusions, they take all of
the taste of the carbon and everything out
[SPEAKER_11]: and you really just get that expression of
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, there's something.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm a beauty BHO fan as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of people that hate on me,
honestly, because you lose water soluble
[SPEAKER_19]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we're talking about terpenes and
flavor BHO, you get some special stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't hate on BHO at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a rosin guy, but I also like and can
totally appreciate good BHO.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I feel like... So many people do not
vape their product out and nobody wants,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, BHO residue in their products.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I feel like it has its own place and I
feel like it's special.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like with water soluble
terpenes, you do lose a little bit of
[SPEAKER_19]: something with specific cultivars,
especially that I feel like perform better
[SPEAKER_19]: with BHO.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, so and I love organic too,
but it doesn't always have to be organic.
[SPEAKER_19]: Synganic is fine with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, like you said, like BHO or carbon
extract or keeping or all the different
[SPEAKER_11]: elements of extraction that come into the
end product of flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: choosing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you definitely are looking now at the
trichrome form, like what is the shape of
[SPEAKER_11]: the trichrome when it develops and at what
stage?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because a lot of them want to do
the fresh frozen in a premature stage
[SPEAKER_11]: almost because it brings a very much
lighter product out in the extract.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.
[SPEAKER_19]: And not every cultivar works or performs
the same way when you do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, like Skittles early is great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Skittles makes amazing rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Candy.
[SPEAKER_19]: People love candy these days.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, you know, it's like we
bottlenecked ourselves into this gelato
[SPEAKER_19]: and candy in the US, which is going to go
away.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to go away.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll be here for the long run.
[SPEAKER_19]: But the thing is, is we're going to have
more diverse stuff coming out.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's people that are striving to add
diversity to it.
[SPEAKER_19]: They may have to sneak it in by crossing
it with gelato.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: To get people to like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But then who knows?
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, Super Silver Haze is going to make
a big comeback.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's got like that spicy back to it
almost.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, and it maybe won't hit the big
cities as quickly.
[SPEAKER_19]: But you look at Humboldt, Mendocino,
Sonoma, Trinity, you're getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_19]: these equatorial expressions and some
stuff that most people don't like,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So both of us working down in the
Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, both of us have worked down in the
SVG.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am presently working in the Virgin
Islands and in the BVI.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these island cultivars, you could take
that same genetic and grow it here and
[SPEAKER_11]: then grow it at 4000 feet and then grow it
down the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everywhere it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally different with the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that really has to do with your UV and
your atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terroir.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and your elevation pressures.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and your fertilization practices and
all these types of aspects come into play
[SPEAKER_11]: with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's really interesting for me to
see it like also defining through the
[SPEAKER_11]: phenohunts that we're doing and,
you know, as you develop genetics in
[SPEAKER_11]: different spaces of the world and adapt
them to that, you know, area specifically,
[SPEAKER_11]: it takes a couple of years for a cultivar
to truly adapt to the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_11]: to the elevation pressure, you know,
the vapor pressure deficit that maybe
[SPEAKER_11]: around and all these elements that we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: I found that at 4000 feet where I have my
farm, the trichromes have more of a
[SPEAKER_11]: potassium capture because at 4000 feet,
those particular goose and hard indicas,
[SPEAKER_11]: they really want that cold snap.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to go down to the 50s and have
still 85 degree daytime, 75 degree tames.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they want that chilling hours
that are really vastly different.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, down in the Caribbean,
it's still 85 degrees at three o'clock in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, O.G.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kush isn't going to perform well in the
Caribbean by itself.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can hybridize it with stuff that does
and find selections that will perform well
[SPEAKER_19]: with the hybridization process.
[SPEAKER_19]: But by itself, it's not meant to be grown
in the Caribbean just like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: We made a whole bunch of crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: Marlon and I, for St. Vincent,
we made some special banana crosses that
[SPEAKER_19]: we're going to be going down there with to
give to the people.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're excited about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big ups SVG, he's coming to help.
[SPEAKER_19]: Minister of Agriculture is about to leave.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's about to get a nice gift.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_11]: They got Cesar Saboto.
[SPEAKER_11]: We absolutely adore him.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's worked really well with the people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's great to see how they've
implemented medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have SGV.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Somis.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have so many different dispensaries
that are starting to open.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really have super impressive.
[SPEAKER_19]: They care about the people and we're not a
thorn in their side like we are in the
[SPEAKER_19]: United States.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very accepted by the government.
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to help people.
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to heal people.
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to understand how to make it
better for people.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they want a product that's going to
make people healthy and not sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like that has a certain amount
of like the catalyst of the Rastafari
[SPEAKER_11]: culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a deep Rastafari culture there
that still remains very true to their
[SPEAKER_11]: roots and their beliefs of protecting the
island.
[SPEAKER_11]: The island is La Soufrière.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the heart of a volcano.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in 2021, when I showed up exactly
at that same time, it was right after the
[SPEAKER_11]: volcanic eruption.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the amount of work that they've done
to redevelop that country, I felt even
[SPEAKER_11]: though it's a British territory,
they really managed to pull out of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even the tail end of this last
hurricane, they got those roofs ripped
[SPEAKER_11]: off.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, Ralph.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bobby sent me big shout out to Bobby.
[SPEAKER_19]: He sent me a lot of videos.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Bobby?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_11]: And Ross John.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can't go wrong with Ross John.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, fuck yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Best food on the island is at Ross John's
house.
[SPEAKER_19]: The shakes are amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, dude, like literally some of the
best fruit shakes I've ever had in my
[SPEAKER_19]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Heck, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the fact that we still can get
roasted bananas on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, true grassroots culture still
lives on these islands and big up to all
[SPEAKER_11]: the islands from Jamaica, Trinidad,
Barbados.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to get medical marijuana and
recreation going.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to like our ability to continue
like being symbiosis or bringing our
[SPEAKER_11]: cultures together and dropping all racism,
all, you know, white, black.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care what color you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like here to work together as a
unanimous community.
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you a good person or are you not a
good person?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_19]: It should boil down to that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it fuckery or is it not fuckery?
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you good or are you bad?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's like there's a lot of
shitheads out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also a lot of good people,
especially within this community.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are still a lot of good people.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it brings out the good people.
[SPEAKER_19]: The plant brings out the best in people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's great for self-reflection.
[SPEAKER_19]: And some people don't want
self-reflection, but it'll do that to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you talk to demons, then you never
know what they're going to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you got to, you know, take that whole
thing and ingest only the positive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it helps.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of people with mental
illness have a community come to that
[SPEAKER_11]: quiets their demons and allows them to
have some self-development time,
[SPEAKER_11]: no matter where they're at in the world or
where they're at in their journey with,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, self-help and mental health and
all these types of things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you so much for coming on
today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll see you at the next show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here at Can-o-Fest 2024 with Stevie
Kulture from iRe Records.
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Give thanks and praises.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can-o-Fest is amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm loving the vibes here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything is good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good people, good weed, good food,
good weather.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not as hot as I would like,
but I'm all right with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing is, it's a refreshing break for
a festival because normally when you go to
[SPEAKER_17]: a festival, it's uncomfortably hot.
[SPEAKER_17]: Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_17]: Were you a reggae?
[SPEAKER_17]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the bands don't even get the good
support.
[SPEAKER_19]: But there was some really good
performances.
[SPEAKER_19]: Marlon performed there and his set was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Over the top, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many.
[SPEAKER_19]: Collie Buds, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I was the MC for that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Collie Buds is... I've seen him perform
several times and that was, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_19]: the best performance that he's ever done
that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing is, with Collie Buds music,
it's always about a topic that you can
[SPEAKER_17]: relate to.
[SPEAKER_17]: That new song, the weed on the back of the
booze, that song is definitely from the
[SPEAKER_17]: first time I heard that song.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, that guy find a hit,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna smoke and drink and love my god.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Collie Buds.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's another hit, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's another hit, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: And his energy is just so great on stage.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the sound system, a reggae,
for an outdoor sound to be able to have
[SPEAKER_19]: that many people and all of them
experience great sound, that's pretty
[SPEAKER_19]: special.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know who they were, but that was
excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was, yeah, it was actually because I
was in the back by the tents and I was all
[SPEAKER_19]: also in the front when the other
performers were playing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just so amazing and so clean.
[SPEAKER_19]: No matter where you were, they'd really
dialed in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not always like that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been to reggae and the sound is good,
really good sometimes, but that is just,
[SPEAKER_19]: it was above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the river stage was special,
dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, the dance hall right down there was
off the chain.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was wild.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, the competition they did that night,
that was wild.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, Sound Clash was wild.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a style that we used to do in
Jamaica back in the day.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it started in Jamaica and it's kind
of got international now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Way worldwide.
[SPEAKER_17]: Europe totally goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Japan too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Japan, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Japan have some of the best sound system.
[SPEAKER_17]: They even come to Jamaica on one Clash,
man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's wild.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been going on for a while,
man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ever since.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's a good experience and the
work that goes into that, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_19]: don't understand how much work goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And unless you understand, maybe you want
to appreciate it at the level that you
[SPEAKER_19]: would if you understood the crazy amount
of time and energy and working with other
[SPEAKER_19]: artists to get these things.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because it's all about working with
the artists in dance hall, Sound Clash
[SPEAKER_17]: business.
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to be like on the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_17]: On the cutting edge of the latest and the
greatest.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's ever evolving and moving and the
needle just keeps moving higher and
[SPEAKER_19]: higher.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you drop the ball, then you can't be in
the Clash, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're here at Canterfest.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a lot of good smoke you're
seeing?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the epicenter of great shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mendocino, this is.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a homeboy, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ground zero right here, especially for the
outdoor and light depths.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're here, you know, you're going
to find some of the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen live plants here that are
amazing too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of my genetics, it was wild seeing
this guy bring live plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, this is Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Humboldt, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is where it all began.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's like, you know,
the original for the whole California.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're on the shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe in the United States even.
[SPEAKER_17]: Humboldt was growing weed before it was
cool to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: When they used to hang you for growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you could do 30 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_17]: You could do whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lose everything you got.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything you got.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I'm happy we're living it.
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people, it's like loving up the
culture, but they never know that.
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a time when you see,
I used to roll on the street.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you even see a cop car, even when you
have nothing on you, you're like,
[SPEAKER_17]: yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got, you got pull over and even the
container that it's in.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get arrested because it smelled
like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: That kind of shit did happen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_17]: People were arrested for seeds for a seed,
a tale that was done and just the 2018
[SPEAKER_19]: farm bill changed all that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Record breaking moment.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something that is extremely special.
[SPEAKER_19]: The 2018 farm bill decriminalize seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And seeds are considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_19]: They have 0.3 below.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're, they're less than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we've come leaps and bounds in
some ways.
[SPEAKER_19]: We still have to get more people out of
prison.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's what the thing is.
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people, they're paid P for not
liking reggae music.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the fact that we sing too much about
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: But they don't realize that there was a
time when your whole livelihood can be
[SPEAKER_17]: gone for having weed in your position.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why we were singing like,
Hey, it should be legal.
[SPEAKER_17]: We shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse my language.
[SPEAKER_17]: Why should people lose all their earthly
belongings just because they have a couple
[SPEAKER_17]: of grams of a plant in their position.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what reggae music.
[SPEAKER_17]: Was all about was freeing the weed for
people to have the rights to smoke it
[SPEAKER_17]: without being punished and get locked up
for years.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what freedom is all about,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, from an American
perspective, it's about freedom,
[SPEAKER_19]: right?
[SPEAKER_19]: The freedom to choose to do what we want
to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't hurt other people.
[SPEAKER_19]: How can that be a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we were hip to the medicinal
purpose of it from way back too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter Tosh was the greatest advocate for
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: In the seventies.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: In the seventies.
[SPEAKER_17]: The freaking dark era.
[SPEAKER_17]: The dark, dark era.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: We got the most chastise and punish for
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: The government in Jamaica back then gave
the officers permission to do whatever
[SPEAKER_17]: they want if we have that in our position.
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a time like Oh yes, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the rebellious ones like Peter Tosh,
he got beaten next door to death for
[SPEAKER_17]: having weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: In his position.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: They cracked his skull.
[SPEAKER_17]: He was in the hospital in a coma.
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter Tosh, 54, 46.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was his number that he got when they
locked him up for smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like our relationship with weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, it's very strong.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very strong bond.
[SPEAKER_17]: We smoke it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We get the vibes of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We know the purpose of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And ever since we've been advocating for
the freedom of weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fact that it get to this point
right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_17]: And a lot of us who advocate for it never
even live to see that what we are seeing
[SPEAKER_17]: now.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of these giants, dude, like we talk
about the giants from Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_19]: the giants from Jamaica, people that
really fight for the right.
[SPEAKER_19]: They set the pace.
[SPEAKER_19]: For what is happening now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So long ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just so special to be alive and
experience all this, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: and in our own ways, we're all stewards of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So like I do interviews and I do my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do my breeding book and I create
genetics and you sing about advocacy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we got all these musicians and
we all play this role in a much bigger
[SPEAKER_19]: thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's such a beautiful thing to be a
part of.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is the fruits of all that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can walk.
[SPEAKER_17]: Into a festival and saw people have the
freedom to smoke and sell and promote weed
[SPEAKER_17]: without have to look like it's a plant and
it makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_19]: At the end of the day, cannabis makes the
world a better place.
[SPEAKER_19]: And to deny people that is just silly,
for one thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's like we all have a role in our
purpose.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were talking a little bit of that
before the interview about our purpose.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I feel like I'm pretty
blessed because I feel like I found my
[SPEAKER_19]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a steward of the plant is a higher
calling or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I feel like I'm blessed to know
where I'm supposed to be in the world and
[SPEAKER_19]: doing what I'm supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like most of my friends that are
reggae singers or musicians, they know the
[SPEAKER_19]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And and that's that's that's the beauty
about the music and the people who embrace
[SPEAKER_17]: the culture and the vibes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, people we're all about making
the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: And like, you know, living in harmony with
the earth, the plants and all the things.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the relationship between it all
because there's a symbiotic relationship
[SPEAKER_19]: between the plant and everything around
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there is something special about this
plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we need to know that not we need to
know that we know that now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there isn't one person in the
world right now that don't know the
[SPEAKER_17]: medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not just for the high.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all they they used to chastise us
and crucify us.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the high.
[SPEAKER_17]: But look how much things.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's so much more under that.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's so much more.
[SPEAKER_19]: One plant can do so many different things.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have all these different medicines to
cure these things that cannabis can cure
[SPEAKER_19]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe it's not that way with every
person every time, because the cannabis is
[SPEAKER_19]: subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have different body chemistries.
[SPEAKER_17]: It depends on what you're going to.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if it can cure a child of epilepsy,
how can you say it's a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my big argument.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the fact that it was being so
criminalized just for the fact that it
[SPEAKER_17]: make you high.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was just.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, beer makes you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know what the problem is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Tobacco, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_19]: What they do is they tune you out.
[SPEAKER_19]: They make you numb to the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, there's a lot of drugs.
[SPEAKER_19]: They make you numb.
[SPEAKER_19]: They numb to the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: What cannabis tunes you in.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_19]: They tune you in psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_19]: They tune you in.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so people are scared of that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Of people being tuned in.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's partially why they're
illegal.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's there's so much more to that.
[SPEAKER_19]: But as far as I like being tuned in,
I would much rather be tuned into the
[SPEAKER_19]: world around me and be very sensitive to
everything than to be numb.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, who wants to be numb and go
through that?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, and I think struggle is
important.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I've struggled through my
life.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've probably had struggles through
years and struggle makes us better and
[SPEAKER_19]: stronger people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it also makes us realize when we're
fortunate and we have good fortune,
[SPEAKER_19]: how important that is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you if you don't struggle, then you
don't appreciate when you when you when
[SPEAKER_17]: you have success.
[SPEAKER_19]: Reggae music is built through struggle and
circling back to all that.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's like that was built on
struggle.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the reason for reggae was.
[SPEAKER_17]: When you're poor, you don't have a voice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the system does not care about the
people who don't have a voice.
[SPEAKER_17]: So in order for us to have a voice,
we have to sing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's the only way you can get the
attention of both the audience and the
[SPEAKER_17]: government.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because once you sing something that makes
sense, the people are going to get onto
[SPEAKER_17]: it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, they got to listen at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to listen.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because once the people is like,
yeah, that song is telling the truth and
[SPEAKER_17]: they start playing it every day.
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody, the mindset of the people
start.
Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like there's a singer called Richie Spice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: He recorded a song, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Richie Spice for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: The song called Earth Around Red.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: That song was recorded like six years
prior to it becoming successful.
[SPEAKER_17]: What happened is the situation that he was
singing about actually happened.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like a bunch of people just die in one
week of a politics.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then a DJ pick up the song and be like
Earth Around Red and start playing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the whole thing just blow up like.
[SPEAKER_17]: Collective consciousness.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody gets on board and they get it.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what reggae music do.
[SPEAKER_17]: We always try to shine a light on what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the song will make the people
like start look at it because you'll be in
[SPEAKER_17]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You wouldn't know what happened here in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if a song is sung about it and then
the song start playing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody's like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, is that happening?
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when Damian Marley sing Welcome to
Jam Rock.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: It make the whole world start look like,
oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys really like that?
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to be careful what you do.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like all club sodas and beach.
[SPEAKER_17]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a rough part of it, too.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a rough side.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a rough side to all of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So music is reggae music to be exact.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Other music have their roots on their
thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But reggae for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Was created on the fact that we want to
make the people know what's happening
[SPEAKER_17]: around us.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So every song has a meaning.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was built on a reason why the song
was made.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's greater meaning behind all of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no reggae song.
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's even about pointing a finger and
hunger, pointing a finger and injustice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the song is always about something.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's purpose.
[SPEAKER_17]: There is purpose behind everything.
Every song.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Every song.
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at, look at Mala Nasher.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's singing about the farmers.
[SPEAKER_17]: He is so passionate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, he's just, yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, ganja farmers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to do a shout out for them.
[SPEAKER_17]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he loves weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: He loves Cannabis, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: He smokes hard.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, he gets it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just, you know, we're just so
blessed.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like just to be here, Cannabis 2024.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're not here this year,
make it a part of your duty.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause I know it's happening next year.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, just come on out,
man, and celebrate life.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not about the weed only.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about community, hanging out with
people, getting to network and you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: see we're networking right now,
you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: James Loud.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's random, but yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's epic, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's epic.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, welcome to Umboldt.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, hope you have full joy
yourself.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Blessed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Stevie culture.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ivy Rockers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Look out for us.
[SPEAKER_17]: I-R-I-E-R-O-C-K-E-R-Z.
[SPEAKER_17]: Rockers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Blessed love.
[SPEAKER_17]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: One love, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am here with Michael from Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're at Cannabis 2024.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a good time down on the waterfront
in Eureka.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm smoking that mind eraser weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a good day for it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've got a lot of good interviews in.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we got three hours of footage so
far today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been great conversations all over
around here today.
[SPEAKER_19]: The energy is really good.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's a lot of OGs here and people
from all over the country.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been really shocked at how many
people have been here from all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: country for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This event has grown from a small local
event thrown by these guys who have been
[SPEAKER_04]: deeply involved in the development
community here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's grown from like a community thing
to a real national footprint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool what they're pulling off.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this city and this community up here
is really great at embracing people,
[SPEAKER_19]: especially cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, it's been great.
[SPEAKER_19]: The weather isn't the best, but I guess
this is very typical for up here for this
[SPEAKER_19]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_19]: And other than the mosquitoes,
I actually don't mind the weather.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a little overcasty, but like I'm
OK.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a great summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like back and forth from hoodie
weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's all year here on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's pretty awesome, but a little
foggy, a little cool today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully the sun will cut through
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking forward to any music?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to a lot of the
music.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys are fantastic legends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lettice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lettice.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are legends of the,
you know, kind of jazz jam funk world.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love jazz music.
[SPEAKER_19]: I go to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_19]: We used to just watch jazz music in
Seattle, vetoes until they burned a couple
[SPEAKER_19]: of years back.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully they'll come back soon.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, I mean, I love jazz funk.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love different kinds of music and jazz.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's so many different types of
expressions that work with jazz and music
[SPEAKER_19]: styles that evolved from jazz,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, free thinking,
but danceable groove music.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like, yeah, that's perfect for
an event like this, where it's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once people start dancing, you won't think
about that at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then tomorrow night, O'Teel and
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Kim Aki used to come through
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Melvin comes through here a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: West Coast powerhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really am excited to see this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time in the South.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, O'Teel and his brother
Kofi, rest his soul, was good,
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing musicians from the Atlanta area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's going to put on a hell of a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope they play some some contributions
to the dead.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I feel like I don't know what to
expect.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I would love to see some Grateful Dead
tunes being played in O'Teel's version,
[SPEAKER_19]: because seeing him with Dead in Company
was always amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw him sing in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he also has a great voice and just a
great energy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love watching him perform, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's just so in tune with the music.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, as Dead in Company the last
couple of years have been mind blowing,
[SPEAKER_19]: really great and really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: And being able to see him and do his thing
here is going to be really special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow, I'm really looking forward to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the area is really hyped for
that sort of music.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a long time since we've had
this sort of event here on the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on this level.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this is wild.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's so many heads out here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Reggae was fun, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so was Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is different.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like these are my people.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And especially with the music
collaboration, I love music and cannabis
[SPEAKER_19]: together.
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes a perfect type of event.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really an outpouring of community
support for this event with all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers showing up and running their own
booths and Canifest giving the free farmer
[SPEAKER_04]: booths away to other small farms that want
to come and display their wares,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all so many of the community is out
here meeting each other, supporting each
[SPEAKER_04]: other, neighbors meeting neighbors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as being a part of a business that's
rooted here in town, it's like you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: go five feet without running to somebody
that's like a powerhouse of contribution
[SPEAKER_04]: to this community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: You live up here as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live about 40 minutes from here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Rick lives like right up the street.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_19]: He let us borrow his tables and chairs.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out, Rick.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to Rick and Gavin for helping us
out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big shout out to you guys and Royal Gold,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're glad to have people like you coming
up, participating in this event,
[SPEAKER_04]: like helping to bring it to a another
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I feel like we're show buddies.
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like we end up getting booths
close to each other.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of shows.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm looking forward to even more next
year, potentially collaborating on some
[SPEAKER_19]: booths.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there's so much potential for
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the heart of what this
event brings to is other people finding
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborative moments like this to build
on the folks from Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Julie's been around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's fantastic in all the talent here.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's just so many talented people from
all different sides of the industry,
[SPEAKER_19]: whether it's genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got nursery people here.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had SC Labs that was here.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got musicians.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mendo Dope, you know, Mendo Dope was here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys threw it down earlier,
too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Their sound system was so good and they
really came off.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were clutch.
[SPEAKER_19]: They really were clean.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that mic stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my stand out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the whole walkthrough on the
process earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, that's that's something
special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you so much for the interview.
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to get you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually need to come do your podcast
next.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, let's get together.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got to get you up and on it,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're making Rick do dabs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: CBD dabs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nah, we're talking.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll trick him and get him.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll get him to do a CBD dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not trick, but we'll get him to do a CBD
dab or a CBG.
[SPEAKER_19]: He could be persuaded.
[SPEAKER_19]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: And CBD, CBG.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you ever smoked a CBG dab or a CBD
dab?
[SPEAKER_19]: Not a dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: No.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we will do some raws and get some
really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Day two.
[SPEAKER_19]: Canifest 2024.
[SPEAKER_19]: Beautiful weather.
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking for an amazing day.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got a huge panel coming up with Johnny
from Huckleberry Hill.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Jason from Ridgeline and we got
Doc.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to go talk to some people here
at the event.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to surprise them.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Julie, I need a second of your time.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_19]: Julie Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's here today at Canifest.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today, Julie?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're on the water.
[SPEAKER_15]: This reminds me of what Seattle Hempfest
was many years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: In 2012.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: In 2012 with all the bugs.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had sand flies and they bit my legs
up and I was scarred for like six months.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for sharing your insect
repellent with me, James.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's wonderful to be here with the
community.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I really love about this festival,
it just is very pure with culture.
[SPEAKER_15]: Music and the community, the warriors that
are standing strong together.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're all scrappy.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all invincible warriors who are lean
and mean.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just amazing whenever we come
together.
[SPEAKER_15]: Magic happens no matter what.
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter what we have to face,
magic happens.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a great event.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's good music, good people.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of people I haven't seen in a long
time coming out to this event.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then a lot of people I see all the
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a reunion.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lettuce last night.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lettuce last night.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got Oteel tonight.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my goodness.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Mendo Dope yesterday was amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_15]: To me, the Mendo Dope boys and watching
them continue to rise and continue to do
[SPEAKER_15]: good within the community.
[SPEAKER_15]: Their hearts are in the right place.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're in it for Mother Earth and
humanity.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just stoked for them that they keep
on rising and doing good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much, James.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Love you too.
[SPEAKER_15]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, we're going to go surprise these guys
over here.
[SPEAKER_19]: They have no idea what's coming for them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sean, I need a bit of your time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just trimming some weed,
but... That's not weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the number 26.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's Mr. Reggie's work there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's straight black.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you grind it with your fingers,
like, your fingers literally become black.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, it's not.
[SPEAKER_19]: It nose burns.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's burning.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, this is Sean from Cutting Edge.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's here with me at Cannifest 2024.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today, Sean?
[SPEAKER_19]: Doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Really happy to be in the sun today.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yesterday was a little cold for us,
but feeling good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Feeling good.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've been on the event tour with me all
year.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been hanging out, smoking,
eating mushrooms and other things.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of good fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: Reggae was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of mushrooms, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: But high vibes.
[SPEAKER_19]: High vibes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Last night was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the music was great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my God, the music was on point.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you go to the after show?
[SPEAKER_19]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_19]: I decided that if I went to the after
show, I might not get here on time today.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to get my panel done, and I'm
partying tonight.
[SPEAKER_19]: OTO and Friends is going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I literally just showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first caffeine of the day,
so I'm just... The afters were great,
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three guys from Lettuce played and
just smashed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, those guys jammed out last night.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was, like, absolutely the best show
I've seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when they played higher, for Red Hot
Chili Peppers, people were like,
[SPEAKER_19]: is that?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's like, yeah, that is.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is exactly what's happening.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a trip.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wasn't expecting that.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I love how they threw that in there
and just did their own version and put
[SPEAKER_19]: their own twist on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that funky style is just so great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we've got some real dead vibes going
on right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what's the newest, coolest thing you've
seen today?
[SPEAKER_19]: This?
[SPEAKER_19]: I was about to make fun of it,
but this is actually really nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the number 26.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sitting here trimming lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Finger trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's Reggie Weedman.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Cannon Country Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they won the Head Stash
competition last year with the 26.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also won Emerald Cup with that last
year.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, this is really special.
[SPEAKER_19]: You gotta smoke it.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you have there, though?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, bro, this is it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm smoking this during my panel.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in about 10 minutes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Johnny and we got Jason.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Doc on the panel.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, local heroes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't wait to do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a lot of respect for all the guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be classic.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's the panel at?
[SPEAKER_19]: Over here?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's over here.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys will hear it on the PA.
[SPEAKER_19]: It should be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like we're in the best spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got music here and really educated
cannabis lectures right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_19]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll come check it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll smoke later.
[SPEAKER_19]: I rolled 20 joints for today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have to roll them up again at four,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm James Loud and we have a panel on
breeding today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got Johnny from Huckleberry Hill
Farms and we've got Jason from Ridgeline
[SPEAKER_19]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful day in Eureka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for having us today.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you guys have some special strains that
you guys have worked on.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've worked on and created over the
years.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's talk about the world of genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you feel about the current trends
in genetics available to consumers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consume a ton of cannabis,
but the biggest complaint that I'm hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: from people is that all the strains are
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all taste the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not they're crossed to one
another and still have the same flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's starting to get a little bit
old for them and so they're really always
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hunt for these new legacy genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that, maybe not with the
flavor or the taste, they're looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: story to accompany the strains they're
about to put in their body.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I agree totally.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there's a lot of the same and I
think it's really helping us, you know,
[SPEAKER_21]: our small crop farmers shine is having our
own genetics and, you know, coming up with
[SPEAKER_21]: new flavors.
[SPEAKER_21]: Preferably, you know, like I like gas and
now I'm coming out with these,
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, gas.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like this double O.G.
[SPEAKER_21]: cam times Lance, which is over there at
the Redwood Root booth.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's a super fire and it's really
strong.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, you know, another thing with
these flavors is now we're starting to get
[SPEAKER_21]: to play with searching for rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so a whole other whole other topic.
[SPEAKER_19]: But what you guys have amazing rosin that
comes off of both your flowers.
[SPEAKER_19]: White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of my favorite and you get the Lance
and the Ridgeline runs that I feel are
[SPEAKER_19]: both extremely special.
[SPEAKER_19]: So now, as far as are you guys breeding
for rosin currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, yeah, I'm, you know,
somehow ended up breeding for rosin and
[SPEAKER_00]: and finding that area of the cannabis
industry different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something new for me to be excited about
always grew was a flower guy and always
[SPEAKER_00]: really bred for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, you know, with help
from the hash community, really found out
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe I should be breeding for hash
because it's it's a better hash flower
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is a flower flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So started doing that and exploring that
and finding some some excitement in that.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: James out here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm with Jay from Tree One for Genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's out of Missouri.
[SPEAKER_19]: Crushed it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've heard some amazing things about you
this weekend, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for actually letting me come on
and represent where I'm from and what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like this is a it's a full circle
moment for a guy from the Midwest to be
[SPEAKER_03]: out in California sitting here with James
Loud, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate this, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: The weather is just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: The crowd is great.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish there was more people.
[SPEAKER_19]: But next year, you know, I'm looking
forward to a huge turnout next year,
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, we were out here last year
to see where this has evolved from last
[SPEAKER_03]: year to just this year, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine what it's going to be
like, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_19]: The vibe is good, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: The people's I've seen more amazing flower
this this weekend than I have all year.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wild stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Such diversity when you come up into
Humble, as opposed to some of the cities I
[SPEAKER_19]: go to where it's like really focused on
living change, a lot of runs and like a
[SPEAKER_19]: lot of this stuff is just spinoffs of
that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Up here, you get a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get some wild stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm seeing some land race genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm seeing some stuff that's worked by
different breeders that's definitely an
[SPEAKER_19]: expression that's their own.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell there's definitely a
difference in NorCal, Humble, like this
[SPEAKER_03]: whole area is weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even just down in Emerald.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you down in Emerald earlier in the
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a completely different vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: A vent, everything, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that too, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is definitely a different vibe up
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: The weed has a different vibe up here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feel the love in it out here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful thing, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this community and this culture is
really the backbone of cannabis in North
[SPEAKER_03]: America and a lot of parts around the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell people you're from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if you're in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know, OK, you guys know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's weed, you guys get it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's a beautiful thing, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: So tell me about yourself.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_19]: How long you've been doing it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So man, I've been cultivating in the
Midwest since the mid-90s back in 1994 is
[SPEAKER_03]: when I started cultivating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been an outlaw life for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unlike here, where it was more
celebrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really had to keep things hush,
hush.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to live this crazy lifestyle to
even to live the way we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about 15 years ago, I did my first
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, OK, I really like unique
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, let me try to combine some
things together and see what I can really
[SPEAKER_03]: do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, I traveled across the
United States working in other legal
[SPEAKER_03]: systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Missouri finally went medical and rec.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came back home and I was like,
now that's really focusing on making some
[SPEAKER_03]: special, unique things that the market
doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what are the genetics like out
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we we have a lot of the genetics
that everybody's growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm old school still.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love these old flavors, these old
expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like one of the goals I was having
in all my breeding projects is how can I
[SPEAKER_03]: marry the old school with this new school
structure and make it prevalent now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I've really kind of been
focusing on is making some special,
[SPEAKER_03]: unique things that not everybody else is
making.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's so what are your
favorite kind of things to work with?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just did one of my real like
the last project I did was I used an NL
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like it was as close to the old
school NL that I could really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I I crossed it in with some of my
flavors that I've made and some other
[SPEAKER_03]: popular flavors around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a Liquid Sunshine's one of
them, which I did with my Mimosa Cuties
[SPEAKER_03]: Face Off OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get all this you get all this fruit of
the new school, but like this peppery like
[SPEAKER_03]: punch from that NL Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I do a lot of work with GMOs
because I just love that old funk and GMOs
[SPEAKER_03]: the most modern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that armpit funk.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's smells like a dead lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like so it's really like I also work with
one of the large one of a large
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation back home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get to do a lot of really cool
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our own lab, Vibe Cannabis is who I
work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on my GMO cross, one of the notes is
like Dahmer breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like if you were trapped in an
elevator with Dahmer and you're like it
[SPEAKER_03]: just goes along with all the breath lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandpa's breath, grandma's breath,
deep breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a little bit of rotten flesh in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know it doesn't sound tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful thing, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: The guy on my podcast this weekend was
talking about pot roast.
[SPEAKER_19]: They got a pot roast, pot roast phenotype.
[SPEAKER_19]: One cross that they made and everybody the
farm loves the pot roast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like I had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did one cross with a with a modified
bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what came out of it was mesquite
barbecue turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never thought I would like to smoke
mesquite barbecue turps, but it actually
[SPEAKER_03]: worked out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so funny because I was smelling weed
that somebody had today here at the show
[SPEAKER_19]: and I squeezed it and I'm like smelling
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, man, this smells like campfire.
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone had some sage burning like at a
booth away from it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was getting the sage when I was smelling
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Really good fire though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like really good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny you say that, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I had a rec grow up in Oregon up in
Tumalo before I moved back to Missouri.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for two years they had massive forest
fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like all the herb was this campfire
kush out there for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't matter what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all campfire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went through that in California a few
years back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's no fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you talked to my partner Bo
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bo was a really great guy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really great guy, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: He had only great things to say about you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the fact that you guys are pushing
the limits in Missouri and really stepping
[SPEAKER_19]: up the genetics game out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're a larger community.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when small groups win, even guys I
don't know, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want everyone to win.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoever you are, if you're in the industry
right now, I want you to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a beautiful thing, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice that the more and more
states come on, more and more people get
[SPEAKER_03]: to come out of the shadows and really
celebrate this plant and this community
[SPEAKER_03]: and this culture, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now is the time to collaborate with other
brands.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like good people all stick
together.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to do well together.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we win together, we lose
together is how I look at it with my
[SPEAKER_19]: friends.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I work with some really great people.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm fortunate to be part of a bigger
community.
[SPEAKER_19]: A bigger community of people that grow
really good cannabis and really appreciate
[SPEAKER_19]: good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, of course we have a good
team in my facility.
[SPEAKER_19]: We put together an amazing team.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an amazing group and it's... Yeah,
I really look up to a lot of the work
[SPEAKER_03]: you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I've been following you around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the story for a long time,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a beautiful thing to sit down
with people that have that same passion,
[SPEAKER_03]: that same drive for this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the amount of people that you can
bring in and build with and actually help
[SPEAKER_03]: support their families and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a real blessing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great because I feel like we're
making the world a better place on so many
[SPEAKER_19]: levels.
[SPEAKER_19]: And to be part of a community that's doing
that, it's like this greater collective
[SPEAKER_19]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're ever evolving.
[SPEAKER_19]: And as long as we're still aware that
that's the end goal is to make the world a
[SPEAKER_19]: better place, we do a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my slogans is Mo Love.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we gotta spread this love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I think it gets lost in this
legality system.
[SPEAKER_19]: It does.
[SPEAKER_19]: And money can get confused with passion
and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Passion needs to be the passion.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the passion for money is definitely...
If that's your passion, probably the
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis industry is in the best place
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also believe, man, if you do what
you really love and you put your heart and
[SPEAKER_03]: your soul into it, man, everything's gonna
work itself out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, everything comes through.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it is, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can really put everything into it
and give it up for the plant... I mean,
[SPEAKER_19]: at the end of the day, we're just stewards
for a greater cause.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's amazing just to be part of this
thing that's so much bigger than
[SPEAKER_19]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a real amazing thing to be a
part of, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that I'm sitting here 30 years
later and I'm in Eureka, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like this is where I'm supposed
to be at.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the sacrifices, all the nights of
like, oh, fuck, every time I've had to
[SPEAKER_03]: tear down and fucking grow because the
scene's getting hot and it's like my...
[SPEAKER_03]: For all of it to accumulate to where it's
at today, I'm super excited about where
[SPEAKER_03]: the next five years are gonna go with
this.
[SPEAKER_19]: All the good days and the bad days that
have built up to be this day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got some beautiful reggae playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Junior Toots in the background,
man.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't beat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got O'Teal coming on tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan, Dead and
Company fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: O'Teal is absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough, I got in early and got
to watch them soundcheck, man,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was like... You hear them warm up
for any Dead songs or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't warm up with any of that,
but I know it's coming.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's coming.
[SPEAKER_19]: Even if they don't do it, I know he's
gonna put on an amazing performance.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully he sings too.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just really excited.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this will be my first time seeing O
'Teal in France.
[SPEAKER_19]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know it's gonna be, no matter what,
it's gonna be a great show.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, yeah, no matter what, it's gonna be a
great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lettuce last night was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, Lettuce was amazing last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: They jammed, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: They jammed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were epic, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people I talked to this
morning that didn't know who Lettuce were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the older heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, oh my God,
dude, they were killing it last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, man, that was,
yeah, last night was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good energy, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good energy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody was flowing, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was great, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, man.
I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd love to get you on a podcast when you
come to the Bay next time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do it, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, no problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here at Canifest 2024 with Catchmaster
Alex.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today, Alex?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was having a great time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, so my big question to you is,
do you have a sticky trap for these
[SPEAKER_19]: motherfucking mosquitoes that are fucking
around?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a little concerned that I would end
up with all the mosquitoes in my booth
[SPEAKER_07]: because I have one of those vector
flylights.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't plug it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was thinking about doing that and
plugging it in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously, you should go on the other side
and plug it in to attract all of them away
[SPEAKER_19]: from us.
Away.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the mosquitoes are the only
problem out of this whole place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday, I'd say it was worse because
there was so much humidity around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And today's also bad.
[SPEAKER_19]: All day, we had mosquitoes yesterday.
[SPEAKER_19]: All day yesterday, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: But not today.
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like a little better.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I have like 20 bites.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, some people too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people attract mosquitoes more than
other people because of their senses.
[SPEAKER_19]: You should make a sticky trap jacket.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I should.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you know how to stick that out?
[SPEAKER_07]: A yellow jacket or something.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where you can have removable sleeves for
the sticky traps on your arms.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a good idea, actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: And put the lights under the armpits,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_19]: If nothing else, you could have a cool
novelty jacket.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I won't even need a booth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just walk around in my jacket.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, seriously, make it like a Letterman
jacket style.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, so how's Kenifest going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kenifest is going really good,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, a lot of my customers have booths
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the people I actually work with
and that use my traps.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normally, I could just walk the show and
kind of interact as far as promoting and
[SPEAKER_07]: all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just nice because the subcultures
here is cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: The music's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is where I'm at right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy to think about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you already thought about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably the best weed in the world is all
right here right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen some of the best weed in the
world this weekend, especially for early
[SPEAKER_19]: finishers.
[SPEAKER_19]: So a lot of my focus has been on breeding
for effect over the last couple of months.
[SPEAKER_19]: But really early finishers is so
important.
[SPEAKER_19]: And a place like this, we are in the
beginning of September and there's
[SPEAKER_19]: finished flower here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a good point, too, because normally
I'll never in history have I seen so much
[SPEAKER_19]: early finishers in one place.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have finished flower that's ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's like, wow, that's a real early
finisher.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's so true, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just varieties, but also with the
depth, too, and all that light assist.
[SPEAKER_19]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a ton of all that stuff up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's almost like the no more season
almost.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's wild because you'd have to do a
harvest time festival like December or
[SPEAKER_07]: something.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of how Emerald Cup was doing
that, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen some gnarly looking weed,
too.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen some gnarly looking weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen some gnarly landry stuff and
some really cool stuff that's been bred
[SPEAKER_19]: locally where they're breeding with
genetics that most people wouldn't fuck
[SPEAKER_19]: with even.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were telling me you had some like 10
pre-rolled already, huh?
[SPEAKER_19]: We do.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have 10 big monster joints left.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I had like 20 this morning.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you did?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, 3.5 grams.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're loving it.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_19]: We got some permanent midnight.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got some Skittles.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got some Zetopia.
[SPEAKER_19]: I rolled up some coffin candy from Shout
Out to Planta.
[SPEAKER_19]: The coffin candy in the RS11.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saved those jars for here.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so epic, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to try that.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: So much good stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Super Silver.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got the Super Silver.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're smoking on a lot of Super Silver.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's super delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a Super Silver that came to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what we were calling it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But all I know is that this sucker would
finish hard at seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's not Super Silver.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was weird because Super Silver haze,
obviously the haze, it's a long strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever we have, but it had like the
nose like that and the look.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, most of them aren't like a seven
week or that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was a weird, it was a random
thing that went around for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, we were doing tricks
like we were trying to finish faster,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, trying to get the ROI going.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we tried out this technique where
you shut the lights off for 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know that one?
[SPEAKER_19]: To trigger it in a flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, to force it into a flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I may do something similar.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so you're already there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but then we had to nurse it back to
health real quick, you know, because it
[SPEAKER_07]: does shock it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, dude, it's a great way to do like to
be able to sex your plants faster.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the best way, you know,
it's like giving them that short Brooks.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for that tip many years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but yeah, if you flash them with the
darkness, you leave them in the dark for a
[SPEAKER_19]: bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it definitely will make them yellow
out a little bit into flower a little
[SPEAKER_19]: faster.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll be able to tell expression whether
it's male or female.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's the best thing you've seen this
weekend genetics wise?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, actually some something actually
was like a pineapple, some some pineapple
[SPEAKER_07]: for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like I just like those that real
bright, kind of strong weed, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I found something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some pineapple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw some really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Black Panther that won the Caribbean
Cup.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got to see some of that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like this guy, Reggie's number 26.
[SPEAKER_19]: Super special.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't remember his company, but he's
he's an award winning breeder.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have seen some really wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dylan from Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_19]: He had some of my genetics here that were
finished that he brought with those little
[SPEAKER_19]: rose preservers.
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a little water tube that you put
on the bottom of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said they have a booth here right
now.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, he's just running around, running
around.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we got Nicky T who's probably got
some fire.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much for coming out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for the smoke, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, anybody out there, dude, try out some
James did some James.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us fire for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the good good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we should.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with Reggie from Canada country.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're here at the twenty twenty four can
of fest.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're here to celebrate a plant that I
love.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got good music, good people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Weather and amazing flower here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen and I guess before I met you,
I got to see your flower and the number
[SPEAKER_19]: twenty six.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember what it was a cross of
forbidden and cherimoya.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I go back twenty five years on the
cherimoya half of the equation and cross
[SPEAKER_12]: with the forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's special.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love seeing special stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the beauty of coming up to
Humboldt, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: You see stuff that's different.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm from the Bay.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we see a lot of the same stuff coming
up here.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're getting all these different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just such an amazing thing when
you got guys sharing seeds and sharing
[SPEAKER_19]: genetics and also looking for diversity.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's way back in her history in 2002
on Maui.
[SPEAKER_12]: She left Maui in an H.P.
[SPEAKER_12]: 13.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the seeds, the continuity of my notes
that go back twenty five years on the
[SPEAKER_12]: Cherimoya and the H.P.
[SPEAKER_12]: 13 was an osemene dominant variety and it
was legendary.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's and the H.P.
[SPEAKER_12]: 13, no matter what you did with it,
you grow it in a horrible room.
[SPEAKER_12]: You leave it in your car in your backpack
for six months.
[SPEAKER_12]: You pull that bud out and you know which
one it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It still smells like the same way.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's just herself.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's here to be here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love those unique expressions.
[SPEAKER_19]: White Thorn Rose was another one I got to
experience last year that I thought was
[SPEAKER_19]: extremely special for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also breeding for effect.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I think there's a lot of guys up
here where most people are looking for
[SPEAKER_19]: something that has bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it tastes good up here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about effect a lot more.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what always informed our breeding
decisions was how it hit people in our
[SPEAKER_12]: community and how it grew in the field,
like how much processing it had to take
[SPEAKER_12]: and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was always effect based.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now in the legal market, we're moving
towards a C.O.A.
[SPEAKER_12]: where some guys will only test it for T.H
.C.
[SPEAKER_12]: to see if it's a keeper or not.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's so silly, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not getting the whole picture at
all.
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, you're getting a very little part
of the picture because there's so much
[SPEAKER_19]: more than T.H.C., especially when you talk
about terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: So throwing these terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now we're getting into flavorants.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Abstract Tech wrote those white papers
last year.
[SPEAKER_19]: I incorporated my breeding book.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think moving the plant forward,
you know, they're doing a great job at it
[SPEAKER_19]: and having these conversations and really
documenting facts as opposed to just
[SPEAKER_19]: theory.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked people in the last year to
describe cannabis diversity to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And how do you describe it and also
describe potency to me?
[SPEAKER_12]: All the smokers wrote back how it hits,
bro, how long it lasts, what kind of high
[SPEAKER_12]: it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: The lab guy says potency is the sum of all
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_12]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a potency test.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, and it's funny because like
phenohunting, if you just use the lab,
[SPEAKER_19]: you're never going to find the winners.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: And from a paper perspective or from a
scientific approach, a lot of guys think,
[SPEAKER_19]: oh, yeah, yeah, we can look at this on
paper or this.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's supporting data I like.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_19]: But at the end of the day, it's your nose,
the nose nose.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we tagged about 74 plants out of 480
or so in the last phenohunt this summer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tagged them in the field.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody was coming over.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd put their name on them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I told them all, we get you a bud with the
seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can run it yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then we saved all these root balls.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now it's onto the smoking phase.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've already lopped two thirds of
them off because they just didn't hold up
[SPEAKER_12]: to the next test.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think about root turps?
[SPEAKER_12]: You ever smell your root?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've smelled the roots.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what's interesting?
[SPEAKER_12]: The forbidden fruit in that line is the
most odiferous to me at all stages.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the root turps, I haven't spent a lot
of time.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when I was in St. Vincent,
I was interested.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were up in the bush and Gombe was our
guide.
[SPEAKER_12]: And his grandma had sent him with
instructions to get some roots.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: For bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she made tea out of it for her
bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_19]: I spent a lot of time there.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going back to St. Vincent to gift
the Minister of Agriculture Sabato.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's still there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's still there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're gifting him seeds that we made
for their country.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did banana skittles crosses that are
heavy with banana punch, banana OG to the
[SPEAKER_19]: skittles.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have times four Collins cough,
apples and bananas.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many unique flavors that I feel will be
really good for the island.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was with Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's our way of giving back.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know the people there.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're extremely poor.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of poor, happy people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if I can help contribute to that in
any way to their society, doing better,
[SPEAKER_19]: giving something to the people that the
people can use to improve the quality of
[SPEAKER_19]: life.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, there's a lot of people trying to
go in there and improve their quality of
[SPEAKER_12]: life.
[SPEAKER_12]: But they need to improve the people's
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd never seen such disparity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I lived on Maui a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I went to St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one thing that stuck with me is the
happiness about what they have.
[SPEAKER_12]: They weren't bitching about what they
didn't have.
[SPEAKER_12]: They loved what they had and were so
appreciative.
[SPEAKER_12]: And everybody was asking for seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I kept saying, save what you have,
because we're still at a day and age right
[SPEAKER_12]: now where it's like the question mark of
what is the value of these land races that
[SPEAKER_12]: have developed in a place like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've been there since I've been
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how did the volcano impact genetics?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because, well, directly on the island,
but there's so many islands within St.
[SPEAKER_19]: Vincent and the Grenadines that have their
own varieties that they've grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: But a lot of this stuff has been
hybridized already on the island.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a small island.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went there in 2018 to talk about pollen
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the importance of pollen
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe in regular plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't think that everybody has the
power where they're going to want to just
[SPEAKER_19]: grow them out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's potential for contamination.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, when I was there, we had a
functioning at the Cannabis Revival
[SPEAKER_12]: Committee, Spirit Cottle.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was like 50 local farmers,
a bunch of Rostas and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_12]: non-Rostas, ganja farmers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I posed the question because I was up
there like, who has selected?
[SPEAKER_12]: And they all were scratching their head.
[SPEAKER_12]: And father and son came up and they're
like, yeah, we think uncle selected.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, then I got brought up to the bush
where we got off at the Rock Beach.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our gunmen, they stayed on the boat.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other guys brought us up and we hiked
so far up and we saw two fully native
[SPEAKER_12]: patches.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is in May.
[SPEAKER_12]: Six to eight foot tall haze looking
things.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was the terpenolene and the
non-terpenolene.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the third patch, Patrick's place.
[SPEAKER_12]: He had the six inch tall plants and the
foot tall plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, Patrick, he's like hybrids.
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, do you ever take seeds off of that
one for the next round?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he just like, let me show you what I
do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he grabs seeds, seeds, seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was no selection thought.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is kind of like what a guy was
telling me at Emerald Cup is like the
[SPEAKER_12]: Afghans, when they came, when people
brought the Afghans here, that was the
[SPEAKER_12]: first time that they had been selected.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like, so like selection is such a key
part of the process for us.
[SPEAKER_12]: But is it new to them?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I think it's new to a lot of
people in emerging markets where they
[SPEAKER_19]: don't have a lot of education on the
thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, St. Vincent's had seeds though.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they've grown from seed for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Marlin's from Trinidad and they used to
get some of the best flower from St.
[SPEAKER_19]: Vincent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they had soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked them, do you just have male and
female?
[SPEAKER_12]: They're like, oh no, plenty of herm too,
the third gender.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got plenty of all three genders.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I talk about Ross John.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was talking about with AC yesterday,
but my buddy Ross John on the island,
[SPEAKER_19]: best food on the island was in Ross John's
house.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Today we'll have to get you on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd love to discuss this more and breeding
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice meeting you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice to meet you too.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with Steve Founder and the man
behind Canifest 2024, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much for coming on the
interview, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, it's been such an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're at I think 530 in the evening,
day two.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been an adventure.
[SPEAKER_19]: What amazing weather today.
[SPEAKER_19]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exhibits all over.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got people sharing all their love,
a lot of flower, a lot of good music.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, you pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an awesome event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out here really and
being a part of this community and having
[SPEAKER_02]: a great event right on the bay here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so glad we took this park over last
year and did it again this year to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: show the community that we have this
amazing resource that's underutilized
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Halverson Waterfront Park.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like this is something that's
only going to get bigger over time.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking forward to the future,
but you really have something going on
[SPEAKER_19]: with the great music, all the local
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, O'Teal and friends.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how you pull this stuff off,
but man, this is great timing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say a big shout out to my
friend, Matty Beck, because he's really
[SPEAKER_02]: made this happen this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He helped us produce the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just got the connections and he's
just the right kind of dude to help make
[SPEAKER_02]: this event and other events here locally
thrive moving forward.
[SPEAKER_19]: So your sound system is so clean.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I think sound systems have been
getting better over the last 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_19]: years, but dude, it sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know a lot of the technical
aspects to it, but I do know what I like
[SPEAKER_02]: and it sounds crisp and clean out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also something about when you hear
music being projected over water,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just a deeper sound to it or
something.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of it's extremely technical to make it
sound good, especially at this level.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were both at Reggae and got to
experience the sound system there and that
[SPEAKER_19]: was extremely special.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I'm blessed to be able to
experience all these things.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you have in store for next
year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this year coming up, we were looking
to potentially do a little collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to leave some of the details
unfound for now, but what we're doing is a
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest competition this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be the next thing that we produce
for KanaFest.
[SPEAKER_19]: We should talk about collaboration.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would love to talk about some
collaboration because we do Cubs at James
[SPEAKER_19]: Law Genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've done some events with genetics and
sharing our genetics out and having
[SPEAKER_19]: contests and you never know what people
can collaborate on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been thinking about wanting to do one
where you get to pick an assortment of
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's genetic whole profile or their
lineup and that's the competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grow the best of the James Law
genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm telling you, so we have genetics that
are in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_19]: We can give everybody plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would be more than happy to donate the
plants for it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think you're big on fundraising too.
[SPEAKER_19]: I see some fundraising stuff that you're
doing over here.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to tell us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs for dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rob's over here doing the dabs for
dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of local artists, artisanal hash
makers and rosin makers and farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: donated some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some fire rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to throw a couple bucks in
there, get yourself a dab and it goes to a
[SPEAKER_02]: good community that Rob's building over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unity within the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have community without unity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this community is so tight.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the community up here and just the
vibe and the energy in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's like it's all found here
along with the good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's been the, you know,
the cannabis family reunion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting for all year here at
Cannifest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of that vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw many people yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, haven't seen you in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just people kind of connecting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, and reggae was good for that too,
but this is on a different level because
[SPEAKER_19]: that's like the music.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, I've been going to reggae for
a long time, over 20 years on and off.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love reggae in the river,
but it's just a different vibe than the
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis community because this is
straight cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything's because of the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: We are here.
[SPEAKER_19]: In many ways as servants to the plant,
but we all have different roles to play in
[SPEAKER_19]: this, this greater thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over 250 different organizations,
companies and brands, whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: that make up this Cannifest this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody is representative of
cannabis in some way or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a few artists and
artisans and whatnot that are here that
[SPEAKER_02]: are not like cannabis specific,
but they come from this creative community
[SPEAKER_02]: of like-minded individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do come around and support the energy
and efforts of the others, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis community members.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it really is cannabis centric here
at Cannifest.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the, I love so many things about
this event, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: You just really dialed it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for saying that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if people aren't super stoked,
what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you so much for including me
in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been an adventure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't wait to get you on the podcast
down in the bay.
[SPEAKER_19]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make some big announcements for all your
events that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to it and, uh, look forward
to taking a trip down to the bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here with Nat from Humboldt Seeds and
Penny, and she's an author and she
[SPEAKER_19]: teaches, uh, nursing.
[SPEAKER_19]: How can I describe you, Penny?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the author of The Cannabis Gardener
and I teach home gardeners how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and do stuff with it in their
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Nat, as you guys all know from
Humboldt Seeds, uh, you know, big
[SPEAKER_19]: influence on the industry.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're up here in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_10]: Loving it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm having a great time at Cannifest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we had a beautiful sunshine this
afternoon and now the classic Humboldt
[SPEAKER_10]: fog's coming back in, but it's been a
great event.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like our family reunion.
[SPEAKER_19]: Are they going to bring the mosquitoes?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is the fog going to bring the mosquitoes?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't get too many mosquitoes out here
on the Humboldt Bay, but so many inland.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people, you know, like think
Humboldt, it's just like all the same,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we have the coastal Humboldt where
it's, we get like, you know, foggy and,
[SPEAKER_10]: and you get powdery mildew, botrytis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, just like literally
five, 10 miles that way, it's a whole
[SPEAKER_10]: different environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like beautiful blue, sunny skies,
hot summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where the weed has always come
from the mountains.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that where the magic happens with
Humboldt Seeds?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're about 20 miles east of here as the
crow flies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it takes a long time to drive there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, what are you guys working on
exciting for this year?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have so many.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm excited to release this
chicken and waffle strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something that I've been working on
for like three years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we were just talking about how the
Klamath dams just came out, which before I
[SPEAKER_10]: was able to really go public with breeding
cannabis, you know, without going to
[SPEAKER_10]: prison.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did a bunch of work in, you know,
18 to 30 to remove these dams on the
[SPEAKER_10]: Klamath river.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the world's largest dam removal
project.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just come to, finally come to
fruition this couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the world's largest dam removal,
the world's largest river restoration
[SPEAKER_10]: project.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we did a bunch of genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how we got into doing genetic
research actually was I wrote a grant and
[SPEAKER_10]: got funding to do genetic research on
salmon in 2006 and then published a bunch
[SPEAKER_10]: of papers with UC Davis folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it all like really carries
over to cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the dank strains of salmon,
you know, were like the same kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: preservation and research go into the dank
strains of weeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, Penny, tell us about your book.
[SPEAKER_01]: My book is called The Cannabis Gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wrote this book because I didn't
really, I didn't think that there was much
[SPEAKER_01]: of a resource out there for average
everyday gardeners who wanted to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the books were really focused on
professional cultivation for farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm like, wait, I need a book that
I can recommend to my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then started teaching classes on how
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am a nutritionist and a cook by
trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really we translate into how to make
wonderful things in the kitchen using your
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannabis and cooking go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_19]: I used to be a chef.
[SPEAKER_19]: I worked in Michelin star restaurants and
done some amazing stuff with food.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I owned my own restaurant for a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now I'm in cannabis and I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I was always in cannabis and now
we can come out of the shadows completely
[SPEAKER_19]: and do this.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's such a beautiful thing to be at a
place like this where we've got great
[SPEAKER_19]: music and really the heart of the industry
is here, which I love.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many people that I haven't seen for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone's kind of gathered and so much
great weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like at the end of the day, you know,
we're all here for the weed too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So check out Penny's book.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check out James Loud's book on breeding to
like great resources.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Penny keeps it really simple.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I love about the way that she
is like, you know, know just like how to
[SPEAKER_10]: grow good weed really easily.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then James is like a little bit more
technical and deep, deeper stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we try to go deep.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I feel like my book has something for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think breeding is a natural
progression.
[SPEAKER_19]: From learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you guys don't know anything about
cannabis, buy her book, get into it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you want to learn something more
and you've already been growing,
[SPEAKER_19]: I think breeding is a great next step once
you can make the plant express.
I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I don't even grow it for two
years, like a year and a half when I bred
[SPEAKER_10]: my first, you know, I wouldn't call it
breeding a strain, but when I made my
[SPEAKER_10]: first, you know, seeds in 97.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You ever make accidental seeds?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've got one in my garden right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call her Miss Mysterious.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mysterious.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good strain name.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what was the coolest thing you guys
have seen this weekend?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the the grow games.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are always fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Olympics of growing, you know,
kind of funny joke, but it's pretty fun to
[SPEAKER_10]: watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching watching the guys stack the bag
of dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having Sasquatch here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Humboldt's so rich with like
cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of people don't think about all
the nuances of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of breaking your back, hiking,
gorilla grow down a mountainside with like
[SPEAKER_10]: a whole bunch of nutrients on your
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_18]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to strap trash cans full of weed
onto external frame backpacks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like rip the backpack off and just
have the frame strap a bag of trash can to
[SPEAKER_10]: it and fill it up with weed and hike out
of the mountain that way.
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mix for some amazing stories.
[SPEAKER_10]: It helped me stay in shape back then.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet now I'm not doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got to figure out something else.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you guys so much for your
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I look forward to having you both on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's do that again sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're here at the end of day two,
Canifest 2024 in Eureka, California.
[SPEAKER_19]: What an amazing adventure.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had great music, great food.
[SPEAKER_19]: Smashburgers were a hit, actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a huge Smashburger fan.
[SPEAKER_19]: There was some great interviews.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like we got to meet a lot of new
people that had amazing flour.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I met a guy from Canada
that has some great stories about
[SPEAKER_19]: smuggling from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're going to get some other guests
on these podcasts that we weren't able to
[SPEAKER_19]: capture in the interviews.
[SPEAKER_19]: But, yeah, we got an amazing lineup of
music last night.
[SPEAKER_19]: And today we got Oteel and Friends.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm super excited about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you guys for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got MJ Biz coming in December.
[SPEAKER_19]: I look forward to sharing that with you
guys there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
