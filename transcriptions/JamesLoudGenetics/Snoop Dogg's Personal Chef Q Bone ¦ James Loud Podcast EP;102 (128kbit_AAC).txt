and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, our special guest is Q Bone,
Snoop Dogg's chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is a big fan of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does an amazing job online with his
food posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm impressed by all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good, James.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's a pleasure being on your show,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been really looking forward to coming
on here with you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like we did in Vegas, that you were
cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's like all this stuff
is very serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you come to Vegas, we meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a cooking event and I'm actually
cooking for a change instead of doing my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast or my seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You show up, we start talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to be doing a food
show together, hopefully in the very near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I look forward to that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from the day I met you,
man, I felt the vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the food is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just felt your vibe cooking
and how you participated with the crowd,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with the guests after you at the
house that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very, very good presentation,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caught my vibe, good vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I feel like that's what
cooking is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about cooking,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one thing, making some food,
just giving it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another thing when you can
provide an experience where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: like they embrace the experience,
they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, wow, this was amazing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get people blown away by some food
where you give them stuff that they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't normally eat together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where we're torching the s'mores
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like I have a lot of fun
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, especially that cup, the cup with
the potatoes and the roast, that prime rib
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had some sous vide, so sous vide
wagyu with the mashed potatoes martini.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had the mashed potato martinis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a three wagyu, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had it in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we sous vide them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we sous vide those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we did them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a three hour sous vide on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put them, we seared them in a pan
and then we sous vide them for three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sliced them nice and thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them with mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing sauce that Chef Ricky made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Chef Ricky, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong with that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah, Chef Ricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing high and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that was a whole nice set.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole line was, the chef's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a good footage of that too though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had the little pasta station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got the pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, and it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it was well orchestrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some good videographers there to
capture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was good weed too,
so you can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, you can't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love when they rent the houses
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that house was designed specifically
for parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like I could do that at my
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a lot of houses that weekend that
I went to that was based on a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one night before that was just as big
as that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had, somebody else had, they had like
a clip from Florida came down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something they were named Bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember her, she had a Florida cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had seafood boiled and that house was
just like that one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that one there was like took the cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you go around a corner, you're
outside and back to waterfall and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I partied in Mike Tyson's house a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Vegas house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that's in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one in the house in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vegas one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vegas house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had a lot of houses though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, California city now already got like
a compound that's been growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: a grow for city, like a little city right
there in California city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they got an education program,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, he's really made making
waves in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is Tyson OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tyson 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he participates that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has podcast going, you know,
I think I was smoking with Tyson up
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked out with Tyson or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's impressive seeing guys that I
feel like guys that belong in the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoop, Snoop, someone who belongs in the
space cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get other guys that are trying to just
profit off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got guys like Mike Tyson that
believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he belongs in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: He belongs with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he smokes it not because of the habit,
I think because of what he's been through
[SPEAKER_02]: as a boxer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it helps him out, you know,
cause you know, boxers fighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: he get anxiety probably, you know,
he's really anxiety type person I can
[SPEAKER_02]: tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably a post-trauma type of person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the weed relaxes him and puts him in a
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you notice, he doesn't get into
it with a lot of people like he used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I seen him and Jake Paul at the,
I think it was some event, smoke a bowl or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some event, there was the other and he
jumped, Mike jumped on his shoulder and
[SPEAKER_02]: they walked in together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, recently.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the old Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the old Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old Mike fighting you in public and
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a mutual friend, Ricky
Palomino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ricky Palomino, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Ricky Palomino in 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on tour with Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time I was a road manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was even, I wasn't even cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just cooking for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even cook for nobody on tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went home, I cooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was cutting myself, I cooked,
but never on tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So me and Ricky rocked real close at me
being the tour manager for the company I
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with and him working with Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got really real close, like real close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Ricky had short hair cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I seen him years later with
the long hair, I didn't know he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really didn't know he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, who is you, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Call him by name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't like people knowing me and
I don't know them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to ask you what's your
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that's embarrassing to ask your
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, man, it's Ricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Palomino.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the only Ricky Palomino I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good friend of mine, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time I see him, I just give him a
bracelet, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's been through a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been through a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a stoner, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He belongs in the space, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's another good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had him on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tissue cultured his plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to give it back to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get to RBK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricky's brother's Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good OG cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real small world, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple people in your post I've
seen and known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been really blessed to get a lot of
amazing talent coming on this show from
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're James Loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: James Loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to come on your show.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you show your hospitality and the
conversation, the vibe that you get out,
[SPEAKER_02]: the energy that you bring, it makes people
want to come to your show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you're a people person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot of fun, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's not fun anymore, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's not fun anymore, it's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not romantic anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's like we're ever evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you the studio just a little
bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this new review show that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, hopefully, we're going
to be working together doing some fun
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be doing whatever I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love doing the podcast and now
combining them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I'm a big Anthony Bourdain
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I love the Food Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I have so many people that I
look up to that have moved forward from
[SPEAKER_00]: all these chefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got these chefs, even Rachel Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm OK with Rachel Ray, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hate on Rachel Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's working with Snoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they first met was on the
Justin Bieber roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was sitting next to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started smoking on the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was smoking on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never seen him before smoking on the
television show on the roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would do it at the Grammys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't go to the Grammys, but the Ward
Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he smoked on that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got close, really conversating then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, I guess, after she went in and came
home, she decided, let me do a cooking
[SPEAKER_02]: show with him because of his reputation
and how he was doing everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it turned out good for them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned out really good for both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crossed demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves Snoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like Dr. Dre and Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Dr. Dre and Snoop with a
cooking now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he understands the collaboration
model really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very adjustable to all type of
aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch him go from reggae music to hip
hop music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop Lion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch him pimpin' Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so many atmospheres of Snoop that
people don't really know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me being a chef, but before I was a chef,
I was just a good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he picked me out to be a chef because
I cooked for him once.
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago, with his Uncle June bug.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how he knew I could really cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: He first tasted my food, some baked
chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cold outside, so we was going to
get on the grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had the chicken sitting in the
refrigerator, party wings, and nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go outside on the grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wanted to cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't want it fried.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people would just bake it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, let's bake it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, I ain't baking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it in the oven and baked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cleaned the chicken out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had never ate my food ever since
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the late 90s or something,
early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're talking about up to 216,
when I'm cooking on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's steady logging into my Facebook
live, steady logging in, steady logging in
[SPEAKER_02]: every day, seeing that I'm cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see him looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came on my live one day and said,
hey, boom, I need to be my personal chef,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on tour with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing I know, I was on the tour,
and that's 216.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every tour now, I'm on with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of food is Snoop like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not a picky eater.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, average.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's what he grew up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of his favorites, I can say,
hamburger helper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say, egg or waffle, eggs,
crumble, salt, bacon, grape jelly,
[SPEAKER_02]: toast, fried chicken, fried pork chops,
fried shrimp, fish, like fish,
[SPEAKER_02]: fried fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetables, he's not going to force one of
the vegetables, but they're round.
[SPEAKER_02]: He eat the greens, macaroni, cheese,
string beans, love rice and gravy,
[SPEAKER_02]: love steaks in little cubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut them in little cubes for him like
that, like a bachi, but really regular
[SPEAKER_02]: steaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's really just a regular eater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you brought a lot of stuff to the
table for him to set up to eat in VIP
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, like that's with all the different
little decorations on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not his jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that's not his jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regular, like egg or waffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He might well eat a waffle here and there,
but he prefers egg or waffle, sausage,
[SPEAKER_02]: bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy Dean sausage for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a regular eater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicken and waffles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like nothing that you would have to
go hire a Michelin chef to cook for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you have a Michelin chef to cook
for him, it's the wrong chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right down home, just regular cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just basic, basic eater, real basic eater,
but he's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Candies, sweets, cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good thing he's thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I'll be the way
to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because he's slim, so you don't see
where it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat all that sweets, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes me fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he does do.
[SPEAKER_02]: He eats a lot of sweet skittles and M&M,
love peanuts and stuff, cashews and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think some of that kind of
regularly, when you smoke a lot of weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to balance it out with some
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like caffeine, sugar, and weed,
but like I try to cut out the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the caffeine and the weed work really
well together too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grew up cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started cooking when you were young or
when did you start cooking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my great grandmother, I was raised
with my great grandmother.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother was young at the time she had
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the first born.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was raised in a house with my great
grandmother, my grandmother, my uncles,
[SPEAKER_02]: aunties, cousins and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the first born in my generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of that seven kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I was first born, she was only
15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my great grandmother has taught me how
to cook, both of them, and my mom at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time went on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my great grandmother was my influence
of cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first learning how to cook was eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody learned how to cook eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the first thing you scramble
with what you're eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I grew up, I just loved to
cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a passion for cooking, but never
created a business, never tried to open up
[SPEAKER_02]: a restaurant, never tried to go sell a
plate and do nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I got older, it's just like older,
older, like in my late thirties,
[SPEAKER_02]: I started doing backyard parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we throw a backyard party,
somebody cooking, I go help them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they call now sushi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know then it was just,
I like helping them cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up taking over the whole cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, man, move out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was doing it on a grill,
like cooking for the homies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I looked back and they started
liking my food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just see them smiling and all the place
is empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people smile and say, okay,
I can cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I season a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like flavor, but I don't like salty
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like too much spicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it just right, balance it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned how to balance it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just from experience, my teacher
learned, looking at other people's cheese
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff and taste my own experience and
see if it's too salty or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned how to balance that and make
that kind of like less sodium,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthier for good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really how I learned how to
cook with my great grandmother.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was my mentor in cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up with parents that both liked to
cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother was also a baker on a bakery for
a little bit when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bread baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used to make amazing bread,
but also everything from croissants to
[SPEAKER_00]: cakes, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my father was friends with a
Michelin star chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master chef from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, I think even before Michelin
guide, he was a French master chef by the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of Ken Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my dad took cooking classes from
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad taught me how to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time I was six years old,
I was in cooking competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I love cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you did that, I still to this day
had a vision whenever I do cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I only cook for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got a chance to really cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the setting, what you did that
day, I've done it now recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: but before I haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I seen you do it, I took ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the cup, the martini cup with the
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take a pastry bag, pipe it in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, people like fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the way you steamed up the
marshmallow in the cracker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used the dab torch, dab torch s'mores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the dab torch thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, put bacon in the s'mores too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all those little details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what personalizes it and makes
it your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just love that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do a dinner party together here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, now I see the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I created Cooking with Q-Bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to have fun and go around doing
reviews, not reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like our diners and dives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way he just hosted people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you barely see him cooking
unless he's at home or when his restaurant
[SPEAKER_02]: is back or he's supporting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the time he's supporting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can cook though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can totally cook, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a great host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's probably known more for being a
host than a chef and a restaurant owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Ramsay in Hell's Kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like the drill sergeant of the
cooking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loves yelling at everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and Gordon Ramsay, one of my
friends, used to work for Gordon Ramsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said the only time he heard Gordon
Ramsay yell when he worked for him was
[SPEAKER_00]: when he fired somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like he was firing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took care of his staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he said he just makes you want to
get on points.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just let you know your smallest failure
could be the end of your career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he also doesn't hire idiots,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the shows, they put idiots in front of
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: He yells at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like guys like that, they can't afford
to have shitty people working for them as
[SPEAKER_00]: a restaurant owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think he had like three or four.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a lot of restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Flav was another one I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like his personality and his
cuisine style's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giada, she's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Giada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's all over the place too.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the grocery, the grocery shopping
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cook in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really wanted to... I'm still
thinking about going on one of them shows
[SPEAKER_02]: like that one day, creating one of them
contests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday somebody will put me on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether I win or lose, I just want to have
that experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I cooked against Bobby Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll train you for one of those two
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to win cooking competitions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially mystery basket cooking
competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you can get really
creative, but you have to have just a base
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding for what you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like going into the competition,
you have an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is what it could be
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you build off of those ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: My second dish where I grew up on is
spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at around a lot of
African-American restaurants, Sova
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spaghetti is made in every household
outside Italian.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our way, just regular ground beef,
spaghetti, tomato paste, prego sauce,
[SPEAKER_02]: regular sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought of three meats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do my special three meats,
bell peppers, onions, different
[SPEAKER_02]: seasonings, cake style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do turkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do three meats of turkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a breakfast turkey sausage with the
turkey ground, with the turkey sausage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put all the ingredients in my
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then at the end, I hit them with a little
secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called a Cajun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not Italian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm bringing you a barbecue flavor
sauce, a Cajun style spaghetti with lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of flavor, lots of flavor to make you
think you was eating Sova.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody I have fitted to have aided
on tour, I do cook for like the staff on
[SPEAKER_02]: tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cook enough for Snoop, but I also cook
enough for the eight or nine, 10 other
[SPEAKER_02]: people on staff and sometimes guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had people came to me and said like,
man, I haven't ate spaghetti in eight
[SPEAKER_02]: years, man, your spaghetti the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured, okay, here I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my secret to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make sure everything I cook,
I got spaghetti at the menu because nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: really has spaghetti on their menu in the
way I've made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've cooked for a lot of venues now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've catered to motorcycle clubs and stuff
to some of them, my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go to their little annuals or
something, or one of their game nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go out there with that spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tray gets so easy to do with a salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: A sweet roll, and I'm winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not one complaint yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, okay, I'm going to stick to
spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my blow up right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can fry a fish and fry a chicken,
a baked chicken, a barbecue chicken on the
[SPEAKER_02]: grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matches with spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a full-fledged platter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel like cooking is a lot like
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to learn how to cook,
cook the same thing over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: till you've perfected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just trying to cook everything in the
world and switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can follow recipes to learn how to
cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually you need to cook to taste,
to your own taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's certain amounts of salt
levels that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's subjective, how much salt is in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people need less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like not so spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like spice at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, the older you get,
the less spice you've got to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've gotten older, I like more spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say in the last two years since I
started doing this cold plunging,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you go in the frigging freezing cold
water for three to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever since I started cold plunging,
I could eat spicy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just in the last two years
since we started doing the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, that I've been able to eat pretty
spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never mess with habaneros before
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, I eat habaneros.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost peppers, it's a little bit out of my
league.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, habanero.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's big right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what made that come out
because of the spiciness in it,
you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know, I love that habanero
spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like the household name now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you see them at Safeway every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere, yeah, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And making off topic, even Chick-fil-A got
a version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ghost pepper, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, ghost peppers, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scorpion is way too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hot that I took one scorpion
pepper with a whole flat of strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sugar, some acid, some lemon juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made this sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had one pepper, one of these
scorpion peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I eat it, like just a spoon,
I just take a little bit on a spoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then touch it on my tongue,
my ears turn purple because it's so spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too spicy for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lady send me, her name was Marie
Stratton.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sent me like a hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maria, she's from Belize.
[SPEAKER_02]: She asked like, I haven't even tasted all
the hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to, you know, unless
somebody come to my house and they want
[SPEAKER_02]: hot sauce, you got a choice to the flame
and super heap of heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she's at levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, like Tabasco is too hot for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine I'm just on Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: One hot sauce, crystal and other,
you know, that super, super hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I, um, the pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that, you know, that just get me in a
sweat box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned to a sweat box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I limit myself on spicy
seasoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, you know, like Creole, Cajun,
all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like blackened and different ones like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like jerk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love jerk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love jerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like pounding out chicken breasts and
doing them jerk chicken style like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take a, I have a mallet and I'll
slice it thin and then I'll pound it even
[SPEAKER_00]: thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the jerk seasoning on both sides and
I grill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can do the legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the whole stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing a smash burgers now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love smash burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I never really get into it because
I, I'll just think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just smash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good fat, fat, fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a smash burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to hit it with the hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you got to do with the smash
burger is basically you got to use 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: lean is the best 80% on work.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you take a,
you make your ball a quarter pound ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put it on the grill when it's
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smash it down with, with, uh,
I have a smasher that's specifically cast
[SPEAKER_00]: iron for smashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smashes it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, smashes it in the burger patty shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your onions that are sliced thin
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you do is you just cook it
until you could see the edges starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: caramelize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You scoop under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your cheese on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the cheese is melted, you know,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is like a minute and a half,
two minute process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your burgers done.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your buns already heated up,
you just put it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use my own special sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like thousand Island,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use pickles and I'll, I'll put a
little bit of shredded lettuce,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love smash burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the important part is the beef with
smash burgers and the bun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, potato bun or brioche.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer brioche myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had one down a rip pizzeria that
pizza and beer in, uh, orange County.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was there the other day,
they use the potato bun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best potato bun I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really conforms to the burger where you
can, you can squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like potato burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want that crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost crispy like bacon,
but it's a burger, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use American cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, they have a, I think it's a smoked
American.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you really creative, smoke your own
American cheese and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you smoke Americans?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you smoke a smoker?
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do cold smoke cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do cold smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the smoke and not the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't melt it and you get all that
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do it as a whole block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you slice it thin, you just have
it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're biting into it, man,
that's tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's time to try that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll learn something every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all kinds of fun cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people said, you know,
the healthy eaters nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have caused most chefs and most kitchens
to serve food with less flavor season,
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember you have to ask, you have to tell
them, I don't want to season on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have to tell them to put the
season on it because they give you
[SPEAKER_02]: straight blamed food because they don't
know, they rather, they're looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know your issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to underline you and you
go into a stage of hypertheria or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you eating that food when it's so
seasoned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, it's a lot of people and I
had a seasoning called grandma hands that
[SPEAKER_02]: my auntie had created in Houston,
Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was low sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could put it on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could put it on any food and you have
to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use nothing at all purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to use nothing else on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use anything else on it,
it was salty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had people that had like high blood
pressure and they would use that seasoning
[SPEAKER_02]: and they would say, man, I can use that to
give me order some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even had chefs kitchens ordered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, she just stopped about a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get her to get it back,
you know, back when she's elderly now and
[SPEAKER_02]: she just in her own little world,
you know, but I meant to tell the good,
[SPEAKER_02]: the seasoning, the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all purpose seasoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just getting on Ms. Dash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not salty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's table blend and watch how the lemon
pepper the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings flavor to the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your favorite barbecue sauce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's Kinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Kinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Kinders, everything, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Kinders is killing everybody right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, you got roasted garlic now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got hot gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a new wing sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their wing sauce is freaking incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we do a lot of AB testing with
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll test this versus this versus this
with nutrients or with soil versus cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: versus whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that with wings at the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the Kinders wing sauce versus
the freaking Crystal versus the Frank's
[SPEAKER_00]: red hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinders, their new wing sauce is so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met, I met, um, the son who runs the
Kinders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him through E-40, uh, and be legit,
um, years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so yeah, I met him,
got real close and like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: he, he didn't add it more to the table
than any other barbecues I see right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like killing the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one I was saying, I can't think
it's got to, he's, he's in every store too
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, but he's based out of Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Sweet Baby Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Sweet Baby Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that sweet and spicy one though.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the balance with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's, it's funny because my
parents live in Texas and Texas style
[SPEAKER_00]: barbecue sauce is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your Kansas city barbecue sauce
and then I love the classic, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what Kinders, I love the,
the sauce they got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinders is killing the game right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went and bought something the other
day that roasted garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I love the roast, I love the
roasted garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that on my steak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even use steak sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I use that on my, on my chicken
or the steaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even use them on my taquitos,
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even use that like when, when I'm making
my soups is different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that Kinders, the different flavors
of their sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they killing the game right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinders barbecue sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spicy with nachos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spice with nachos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I use it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it on my nachos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it on the nachos, the little cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put everything else on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put that lettuce on it and tomatoes on
top and I'll sprinkle that little thick
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinders in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, they put that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can really make a bland
hamburger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll put nothing on it and put that
Kinders on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get all the flavor out of
that sauce right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secret to meatloaf is not just ketchup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's barbecue sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do barbecue and I do ketchup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbecue and ketchup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mix mines.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, yeah, my girl, she, she loves that
just to catch up and some just barbecue
[SPEAKER_02]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, you eat barbecue sauce on
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just barbecue, barbecue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Hey, that's what the flavor is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just call me the barbecue king eater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like switching it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying Mr. Stubb's too though,
but you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like a Texas barbecue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you got the cowboy hat black with
the cowboy hat on it be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the difference between like
Kansas city barbecue sauce?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more vinegary, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more the Kansas city is more
vinegary, more vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what is Texas is more like more it's
richer flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas is this thick, spicy stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I had met a meat company out when I
was on a road, we was on tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a meat company in Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do Wagyu burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grilled steaks and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing like 300 cows a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 cows a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're real big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love barbecue though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with most barbecue spots
is their sides suck, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you going there for the meat anyway,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The potato side is no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beans is no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love good beans and I love good mac
and cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those are the things I love too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably eat those more than I eat
barbecue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like mac and cheese is something I pride
myself in my mac and cheese too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I make my mac and cheese different
from my roommate, my brother, he put me up
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He that instead of milk, he uses cream
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's cream mushroom in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the pep milk and the candy use
cream and mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's you got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I'm like now I don't even make it
without the cream mushroom because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: also melts the cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then the cream mushroom,
you know, it's creamy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it creamy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's on play and it has flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you that cream of mushroom flavor
into the, to the mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the truffle Mac, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put the truffle, like we make,
I make truffle oil from scratch too,
[SPEAKER_00]: from real truffles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we make, I like the kinder,
I like the kinder truffle steak,
[SPEAKER_02]: truffle steak seasoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're killing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, kinder's not just killing
them with the sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: He coming up with the seasoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got the classic ball tip
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best sandwich in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bay area is that kinder's ball tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the Snoop doggie dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one dirt dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirt dog was matter of fact in Vegas and
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't opened one up here yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aim and I keep asking them to open
the one up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dirt dog has like 10 different
hot dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all use the nation's beef links.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a Snoop doggie dog, which is made
out of coleslaw, the billionaire bacon,
[SPEAKER_02]: the maple brown bacon, you know,
and it has a special Hennessy barbecue
[SPEAKER_02]: sauce and a gin sauce, like a lobster
sauce, like a creamy orange, creamy sauce,
[SPEAKER_02]: lobster sauce, but it's got gin in it for
the dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's made on the Texas toast bun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Snoop dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have exhibit dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got that, they got like seven of the
patty melt dog, the strawberry dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, they had an LA,
like six places in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got four in Vegas and they have a
compound, a big compound, like where they
[SPEAKER_02]: throw parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowrider shows at the city of commerce in
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to create a Snoop doggie
dog dog for that restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Snoop didn't have nothing to do with
it, but okay, go ahead and make it for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I created his billionaire bacon and we
created- Oh, so you created the
[SPEAKER_00]: billionaire bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he didn't create the billionaire
bacon, but I took the billionaire bacon
[SPEAKER_02]: and put it on the Snoop dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't know Snoop dog created
the billionaire bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cook billionaire bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many other chefs have made the
billionaire bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the millionaire bacon and then
Snoop had the billionaire bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made the billionaire bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I need to make a trillionaire bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into the seasonings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: My folks, she has the seasoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has the CBD seasoning right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to lace it with THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has lemon pepper, Cajun, cayenne
pepper, all purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she have like taco seasoning,
you know, and all CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to do it in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has the butter, the honey butter,
the olive oil and all that CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: but she wants to change it up to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to collaborate with her with
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also have a Stoner brand,
or you heard Stoner brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a cocktail coming out called
Chronic Tonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to the final stages of
getting that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be a THC cocktail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruit cocktail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real nice, smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it'll be in consumption line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'd be on the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four different flavors and stuff,
you know, and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way the world's moving more
towards cannabis consumption than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like the alcohol, they're making
a cannabis style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the appearance of alcohol,
but it's really got cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get more about of it health wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting more about it, you know,
in far as taste, you know, because you
[SPEAKER_02]: only taste THC and alcohol, you got every
other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out of, you don't know what's in
there, you know, what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the fact that the THC cannabis
is working its way to America's land and
[SPEAKER_02]: the way we post to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Health, enjoyment, amusement,
entertainment, and even in bar line,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I heard the governor news in the
past, the consumption lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm excited about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when do, I mean, is it an effect now
that you can actually apply for?
[SPEAKER_00]: The law, I believe that people are already
starting to apply for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's going to be a big
game changer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the industry is suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that we can have consumption
lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's just a necessary
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way you really look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go buy weed at any place and have
nowhere to consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in your home, you can't stand outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be at a hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have no place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have a business, you can't sit
on the side with your business smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not want to smoke in the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not want to smoke it in a
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not want to smoke it in a bar,
a lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have academies and few lounge
like Amsterdam does, now everybody has
[SPEAKER_02]: some place to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the profit of cannabis is starting
to explore more, especially in all
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways with the drinks,
the cocktail, the food, the different,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and then you can have this
consumption lounge that sells food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got more money coming into
the local, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's economical profit for any community
it comes in nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to that experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, my brother,
he owns a cannabis counter Oakland on
[SPEAKER_02]: 24th.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of MacArthur, you know, and we just
built the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: He built the outside, you know,
I got the booths on the sidewalk,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was covert.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had you outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he built a cemented booth on the
sidewalk, cemented brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most of you build a will and
they can move it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is built on the ground now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause in Oakland, if you don't do that,
they're going to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how crazy it is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want you to build something on the
park on this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I mean, the thing is,
is if you don't, people are going to steal
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Oakland is just rough right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But downtown MacArthur, MacArthur was
right there where he's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, I liked it right there down
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I love Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the city of Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisco, I experienced Frisco, but Frisco
reminds me of New York, congested,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you just can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, you can't,
you know, you can't figure it out right
[SPEAKER_02]: there at Frisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland is still historical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still have this culture from the
sixties attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The houses are still the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old school people with Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Berkeley right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mounts of bar, lounges and food places and
every background that you can see in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I love Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing to complain about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both cities have a special place in my
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole Bay area, you know, it's like,
I remember going to San Francisco to hate
[SPEAKER_00]: street party in back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripping on psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did that in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oakland is just, you know,
I've, I've lived in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lived in on and off throughout my
life too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we, we've had houses, we've stayed
in Oakland, we've had grows in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a chef in Oakland.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, just hate the bippin
they take down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, when you, but when,
you know, well, I think what made people
[SPEAKER_02]: more in Oakland and do the bippin,
it's because social media hyped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you got copycats.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they changed the laws,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said anything less than 900 and
whatever dollars is, is they won't even,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll issue a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than arrest you, you don't get
arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get served a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think San Francisco has now changed that
laws and the places aren't getting robbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in New York years ago and I was
cooking for somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to go to the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed some butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the little market and they got a
little markets, real little small markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to market and I get some butter
and it wasn't none.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, actually the stores, you have any
butter in the bag or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's no butter here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never seen a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the butter going, you know,
like it's got to be who did you run out of
[SPEAKER_02]: butter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, she said, Oh no,
they didn't came and stole the butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, he said a butter now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't stop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, because they told us that we're
not supposed to intervene with the
[SPEAKER_02]: thieves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they come and say,
and the police is not coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've been did this in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing this years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I started sending years ago,
start here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not, they're not really coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they promote it and let you know
in the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not coming out with this and
that trespassing homeless in front of your
[SPEAKER_02]: store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not coming to move that,
you know, come on now, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: make people take matters in their own
hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you find the vigilante
start growing and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could use a bad man right about now,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use a bad man robbing and calving
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use all the superheroes and come
back including ourselves to actually do
[SPEAKER_02]: what they got to do right now,
because it's, it's, it's a grace.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disgrace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at the Martin Luther King
parade yesterday in LA and the youngsters
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they quick to post it on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see the police responding to it,
but instead of cuffing the youngsters or
[SPEAKER_02]: just talking to the payment, they pushing
them because they don't want the backlash
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of their parents saying, Hey,
you pushed on my, you grabbed my kid and
[SPEAKER_02]: slammed him to the ground and dog tied him
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to bring up some respiratory
problem or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the law enforcement just
suppression.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just pushing them out the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they push, and when they push
them out of the way, they going away and
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to jail, no consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me go do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, and again, and again,
until somebody, the consequences is only
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be if they do go to jail or
something else happened over that should
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, when they don't do it,
parents complain, Oh man, why you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: take it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard people that take them all to jail,
take them all to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying that, well, they wasn't doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to be shown on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody posted on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they see they're not taking them to
jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now kids feel like, okay, now we can do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something, now they're looking
to fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a real fight that just on
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: One girl was right here, selfieing
herself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just fighting like right here,
close with these jars here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about tens of kids just,
they not fighting that broad cause she
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't have been filming.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'd have been knocked down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Police is right there on her side telling
her to stand back, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just pushing them out like,
wait a minute, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when do you, when do you really
pay attention that these kids really need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be disciplined for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really need to be, they need to be
handcuffed and took into juvenile hall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they realize what's going on
because what's going to happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to end up killed or,
or they'll end up doing this and doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're turning 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause most of them is about 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see somebody that like 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was 11 years old out there
fighting and stuff, doing mischievous
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but not in that attitude to where,
you know, your parents, our parents are
[SPEAKER_02]: grandmothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a lot of them have their
grandmothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these grandparents is my age and
my age, my grandmother was my age then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was go out there and get that switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hit you with this glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take this ashtray and bust you across
your head with you disrespecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different world when I was a kid
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mess around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, fuck around and find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the, you know, it's like,
you fuck up, you do some stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get slapped on the back of
the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even, you can't, you can't even,
and they know they're calling the police
[SPEAKER_02]: on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're calling the police and make a line
next to, you know, you sitting there in
[SPEAKER_02]: their house and the police knocking at
your door for you, not your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to get spanked with wooden spoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to get spanked with belts,
wooden spoons, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The racetrack, the distinction cord,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get hit with a pitchfork or
something across your back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mess around your parents like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were way more respectful back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't, nowadays they don't,
they're not, they're not respectful
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays because they don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, it's a big difference at
what people do with how these kids
[SPEAKER_02]: carrying themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm still in the
discipline of my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in it really telling them,
you know, Hey man, don't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them what's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you tell them a lie, that don't
make them rebellious or make them go
[SPEAKER_02]: continue doing mischievous type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know the real consequences of
being out there acting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know that they ain't even going
to church no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't tell them God don't like
wrong, ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: God say respect your parents, your days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even know that verse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't pay attention to that verse.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't, they plan, they plan the
wrong, playground, you know, they plan on
[SPEAKER_02]: devil's playground and he don't play
games.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the biggest trick here
report in the world to make everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: believe he don't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he don't believe in such things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you don't believe in devil,
then you don't believe in God straight
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you believe in God, you should believe
in the devil because right is right and
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's two sides to every story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like love spelled backwards is evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, love backwards is E-V-O-L.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you grew up in the Bay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew up in this area?
[SPEAKER_02]: My family grew up in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of cousins up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved actually up to the Bay eight years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you're in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Born and raised in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: My whole family for generations,
generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: My great grandmother, my grandmother,
my mother, my father, all my brothers and
[SPEAKER_02]: sisters, cousins, the whole family's in LA
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have maybe 15, 20 cousins up here
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have a big family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my father, he has 13 brothers and
sisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say three of them moved up here and
they all three got kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother found me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have kids up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a lot of cousins up here and
then friends I have accumulated over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people in the Bay came to
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I greeted them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I moved up here, they greeted me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I got the sick with the chain
from me 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got it was because of 17 years of
friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so me and him was real,
real close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm the big brother now to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he's really close to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and his brother D shot together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They every other day, you know,
helping with his music and everything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like my home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my home nine years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's made LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LA is special too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like visiting LA, but I couldn't live
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more, I'm more of a NorCal vibe sort
of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on these pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you're testing some of the new ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the glass tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I first started smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go, you know, Snoop, that's what he
smoked them glass tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people wonder why would you get
them glass tips?
[SPEAKER_00]: B real started those, the funky field
tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flat ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the flat ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had them on blunts, Louis the 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gee, Louis the 13th.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Louis the 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my buddy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, a lot of people was
saying, man, somebody who's rolls with
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who rolls with Snoop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does this with Snoop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop pays this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: This the roll thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would ask me every day, is you,
is you doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't, I barely know how to roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rolled something that really come up
short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis the 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, he smokes that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he'd bring them already pre-rolled up
into the gold packets in this box.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these come in the box,
ain't in the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he would bring Snoop, a whole bunch of
them already rolled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop would have to roll them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just light them up, light them up,
light them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where, you know, a lot of
people got the idea of who's rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't figure it out because you
don't be around Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop know how to roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's homed in on a lot of Louis the
13th for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He smoked Louis, he smoked Louis OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: He smoked Louis 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Louis OG is classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd throw the weed out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a classic story from when you
were on tour with Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this really, one of my classic
stories with Snoop is before the tour,
[SPEAKER_02]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I got to cooking for Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I went on tour with him in 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2005, How to West One was tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my first experience on tour
with another artist on his tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did a single with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my most classic experiences with
Snoop had to do with Suge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Deferral had, you had to get a
sample clearance to use certain songs,
[SPEAKER_02]: samples of certain songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had bought this song on a company I
was working with called Bulldog Music at
[SPEAKER_02]: the time, 2005, had an artist named Owee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sampled a song called Snoop by
Jenna Juice by Cry Dry Yize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we let her cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to go to Suge Night to get
that sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that time, Suge Night had to
publish it for Deferral Music.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was, him and Snoop was getting to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he wasn't talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he wasn't releasing none of the songs
to nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had bought the song, we had bought
the verse from Snoop to get on the song
[SPEAKER_02]: with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we let him just get on the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody, Suge would not release that
song to nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody knew I knew Suge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I met Snoop, actually
through Suge Night.
[SPEAKER_02]: He induced me to Snoop in 92 during the
gang shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me and Snoop got close then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumped up to 96, I started working with
the rapper artist, Mystical out of New
[SPEAKER_02]: Orleans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I got close to Snoop then,
he assigned to Master P. So I'll be with
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystical and he'll see Master P. And he's
like, hey, man, you up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: You everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh yeah, I'm just like you,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just started his career off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then up jumped in 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Snoop Dogg doing his thing,
Snoop lying and this and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to get the song clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got to me to get the song clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to Suge Night and got the song
clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not, Suge Night cleared
the song for nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't charge us nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did it, I think, because he wanted to
show that, you know, I could do this
[SPEAKER_02]: however I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to rise to this here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't charge Bone, me and Bone,
good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all met Bone through me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bone has a nonprofit and I give clothes,
toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turkey's doing Thanksgiving, Christmas,
you know, to his organization,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sponsors, this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody knows the City of LA that
Suge has a relationship with me,
[SPEAKER_02]: even Snoop did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got the song clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it blew up, blew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went on tour and going on tour with
Snoop, we got real close, real,
[SPEAKER_02]: real close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about that was my most
exciting, getting that song cleared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did something nobody couldn't do,
whether it was the label was Asylum or the
[SPEAKER_02]: label Snoop, or they influenced,
anybody influencing the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little old me come from the streets and
get a clearance of $100,000, $200,000
[SPEAKER_02]: clearance, but not even a penny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even a penny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my, I think that was my most
experience working with Snoop,
[SPEAKER_02]: because once I got that cleared,
we did the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went on tour, song, and on tour,
when we was on that tour, one of the most,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the most iconic things that
happened is we was in Seattle performing
[SPEAKER_02]: and a guy ran on stage and hugged Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And boy, that security came everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was out, I was on the bottom floor,
on the front floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happened to be a handicapped dude
sitting in a wheelchair in small,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a chair, one of them, he was really
paralyzed and he was smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Snoop passed a joint to me,
the blunt to pass to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be down there, you know,
passing a blunt to the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm the road manager, so I'm not
really have to be any place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I chose to be on the front row,
you know, pass to the fans, seeing the
[SPEAKER_02]: fans reaction to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a people's person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I go out in the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll see me out there, like,
wait, all the way out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Snoop would see me out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, pass it, I'll go pass it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I seen that happen, I jumped up on
stage and ran up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled the dude off the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't get beat up and,
you know, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how'd you get up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that right there was one of
the most, like, iconic and classic
[SPEAKER_02]: situations with Snoop and me, you know,
be there for him, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for him years later to come back
and be and recognize that from 2005 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 2016, we were just cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never did nothing else on tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I backed up and being there with the
artists and went home and had me a
[SPEAKER_02]: childcare center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was working at home with my family
because I was going to roll from 96 to all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to 2006 on the road and music,
you know, 92 to 2000, 92 to 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing nonprofit in the community,
had a nonprofit program through today,
[SPEAKER_02]: Gang of the Venture program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know how to stop the violence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to deal with the kids in the
streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking, I'm just talking out of
reading a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking from my experience,
like my name ring a bell in the streets at
[SPEAKER_02]: Peacemaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name ring a bell with a reputation in
the streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being who I was before peace, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffusing the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diffusing the situation, stopping the
situation, building solutions more than
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that situation won't have to come back
because you can't replace something with
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't tell a person to leave the
corner if you're going to give them
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking about to give them
something to eat because he's going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back to that corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he's mentally not right,
you can't give him a job because he's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to mess the job up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to get help first and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, my history goes a long ways in
these streets as far as Peacemaker and
[SPEAKER_02]: community person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did TBN network.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to the White House with Bill
Clinton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the youngest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm King Center, Martin Atlanta,
Coretta Scott King.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke at her frontal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an obituary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I traveled with her daughter, Bernice King
and her brother and sister.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's addressed me as brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got dressed her as my sister.
[SPEAKER_02]: We traveled the country together,
speaking nonviolence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a certified facilitator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can teach the Martin Luther King,
10 steps, King and nonviolence,
[SPEAKER_02]: social change, philosophy, curriculum in
schools, colleges, police reform,
[SPEAKER_02]: clergy, city council, group one-on-ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm certified to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wear many hats when it comes to
peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, I never know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know how to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just barely learn how to look at weed
and tell the difference of what weed is
[SPEAKER_02]: and certain weed is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just a consumer, a person smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really didn't even smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my best friends got me to smoke
weed when I came home back in 1989.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, I was smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, no, man, you gotta smoke weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's humble you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hanging with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at yourself in the mirror
differently, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, okay, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up, I didn't really smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I did like 16, 17, I snuck and did
it, but I still respected my
[SPEAKER_02]: great-grandmother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when I went to jail, came home as an
adult, my grandma passed, I still
[SPEAKER_02]: respected my mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to this day, mother rest in peace,
but even with my mother right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't smoke around her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel comfortable doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I was around your parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that a kid's not gonna
leave you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna leave you to respect your
parents or your elders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't smoke in front of my
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go outside and smoke, but I'm not
gonna smoke in front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even hit the pen in front of my
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a respect thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're older people, we're not old
yet, but we're older, but we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different level of respect for our parents
than a lot of the younger people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some that are still respectful,
and there's some really good young kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's young people, but yeah,
but it's a different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ricky Palomino, when he came on here,
he talked about being in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_00]: how he almost got arrested for weed with
Snoop, and almost took the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were cops who were gonna arrest him
if Snoop smoked on stage, and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys ever get in trouble?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even at the time, like I said,
I've been on the road with him since 2005,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when that first tour I went with
Snoop on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to know Snoop, how we doing every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too, we smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had to just make it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the city's all embraced Snoop pretty
good, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do today, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they did then, because back then,
it wasn't no $200 thing on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't none of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't smoke cigarettes on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: No weed problem for an hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where Ricky shot him, because he's
willing to pay for it, like right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There ain't no ifs, ands, ands,
buts about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smoking going on in his room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hotel know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they tell you to find your $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good enough smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got $500, so I smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's bigger than just one little room
with me as a Snoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's coming to you and saying,
he's bringing your customers, and he can
[SPEAKER_02]: take away your customers if you boycott
this hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a battle between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like Thunder Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not playing about you smoking a
weed in Thunder Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was smoking all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could smoke cigarettes all day long in
the casino and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way worse for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way worse for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Hollywood, you can't smoke
cannabis on the streets, but you could
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you could smoke cannabis in Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not cigarettes on the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hollywood is like cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they you know, there's a lot of
places in LA that look the other way when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that happen here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York, you can smoke freely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did New York Times Square cooking
for Wonderama TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I smell a cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can smoke on the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The police right there next to the police.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just a blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be the worst before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had the right to stop and frisk
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For no reason at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend of mine, a good friend of
mine long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like maybe 90, maybe early 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got caught with a joint coming through
LA, Las Vegas airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: They banned him for six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would come back to Vegas for a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Las Vegas is fully legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they got dispensaries all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've really embraced the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they need more smoking lounges
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they do because you can't smoke
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can't smoke outside on the
sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smoke in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't if you have a really big suite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke weed all you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, on the balcony.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big suite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a parlor suite, some of the
big suites, you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke alarms don't go off or anything,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was people smoking cigarettes and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the Palazio.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Palazio, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next day together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two of them next to Palazio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in a big old, if you're right,
a big old, big nice suite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing champs wasn't here like three years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So me, Ron Bass, Dabstar Josh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabstar Josh and his wife and a few of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we was in a big old room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big suite.
[SPEAKER_02]: My cousin had rented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big nice penthouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Theater room and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking so much in there that the
alarm went off in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the whole hotel went off,
you know, because just get the flash in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just flashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it smoked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to bring the big fan in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, are we finna kick us out?
[SPEAKER_02]: They finna kick us out this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they said, hey man, y'all just smoking
too much, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got the fan on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Left two fans in there to blow the smoke
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did not find us another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I said, you know what,
that's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke in these big old suites and
get away with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There ain't no ventilation going on out
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you got a little room where you can,
you know, flip the little window out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to blow out the window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they come and find any tobacco,
loose tobacco wrapped up in a napkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a trash can.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to say you smoking
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not messing around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't throw no napkin in the trash can.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take that napkin out of the trash
can, open it up, and if it's tobacco,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just broke down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see they haven't smoked the
tobacco because it's just broke down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not ashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no ashtray, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took, I broke it down and rolled my
cannabis and I went downstairs and smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it's on your clothes and when
you come back, the scent is in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They figured it got on the curtain.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the business of making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five hundred dollars every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just seen that all start the weekend the
other night at the Hilton Garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even reveal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh yeah, bitch, I won't be smoking
up in here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even smoke, matter of fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just waited until I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I didn't come back for a
couple of hours, I just smoked and died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have one piece of advice for
your younger self, what would that one
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go back to when I was 15 years
old, my younger self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I would say street life,
I would have took.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the way I did take it, gang banging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things I did, activities that
I applied myself to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have told my younger self not to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why I'm saying these 15 years,
13 years a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at that age, you make a decision
to step into a whole different life as a
[SPEAKER_02]: teenager, to a grown teenager,
because at 15, you become that young adult
[SPEAKER_02]: almost because 18, you tend to do things
before you get 21, preparing you for 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: That three year cycle and everything,
age.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 12 to 14, you're all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 to 60, you better wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take your training wheels off your
bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to school by yourself now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know enough to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would tell my 15 year old,
stick to the positive things in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take advantage of education in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take advantage of your religious belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in peace with God, keep it peace
back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because back then, you didn't have no
devilish attitudes unless you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did, go to church.
[SPEAKER_02]: You was going to church.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people out to my 15 year olds,
go to church more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back to church more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Participate in sports.
[SPEAKER_02]: Participate in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think a positive future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically I could tell you,
live your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tell myself, just take your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take my time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'll just tell my younger self,
hang with the turtles, not the rabbits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if people are looking to find out
more about Q-Bone, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly you can find me on Instagram at
BigQBone52.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooking with Q-Bone show on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me at BigQBone on all of my
social media, from Twitter or X,
