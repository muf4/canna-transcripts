[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm James Loud.
[SPEAKER_08]: In today's episode, we have special guest
Dave Mesford, better known as Dave Dammit
[SPEAKER_08]: by the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: April 10th, I called Dave to check in on
him and he wasn't doing well.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd been fighting cancer for three years.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wasn't sounding so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I told him, man, I really want to see
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be up there on Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, I don't know if I'm going to
make it till Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got on a plane on Friday morning and
we'd been talking about filming an episode
[SPEAKER_08]: of the podcast for a year since we started
the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really wanted him to come down and
see the facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's been going in and out of issues
with his bladder cancer that has
[SPEAKER_08]: metastasized and spread to other organs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on 420, he lost his battle to cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next two hours, our podcasts are
dedicated to Dave.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a GoFundMe to raise money for his
family that you can see in the description
[SPEAKER_08]: for the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you guys can donate, that would be
great.
[SPEAKER_08]: The money goes towards his medical bills
that his family has to pay and also
[SPEAKER_08]: contributing to his memorial service.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_08]: This show is difficult at times to watch,
you know, but Dave was a tough guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the toughest guys I know and one of
the nicest guys I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_08]: He met me or I met him in 2012 after I won
the cannabis cup for high times in
[SPEAKER_08]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: He took photos of me in Washington and
we'd been friends ever since.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was one of those guys who lit the whole
room up.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was always just an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had this crazy long hair that was
always perfect, curls, good guy,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and he was passionate about so
many things, but we really connected on
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, food, and photography.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was very passionate about all three
of those things and his family was his
[SPEAKER_08]: number one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope you guys enjoy the next two
hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about the world history of
cannabis and this is an important part of
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here on location.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're up in Washington with my good
friend, Dave Mesford.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing today, Dave?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, James.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great to see you as always.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could have come under different
circumstances, but I'm glad that we get to
[SPEAKER_08]: hang out and do a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like the oral history of cannabis
is so important and you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: great stories that I hope we can share
with everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that cool how suddenly us old stoner
hippies are kind of the elite keepers of
[SPEAKER_04]: the story?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hard feeling to describe,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still, it's like kind of poofoo in a
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I think a lot of people think
it's just weed, but it's so much more than
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you in your own right, or are a
revolutionary as important as so many
[SPEAKER_08]: people throughout history that have tried
to change and succeeded in changing the
[SPEAKER_08]: future.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I first met you, we were at my
uncle's house and we were shooting some
[SPEAKER_08]: photos for high times.
[SPEAKER_08]: After I'd won the cup while I was featured
in high times, you came and took those
[SPEAKER_08]: photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we met.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember the first time coming to
your house, you were growing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_08]: your front yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, you're up past Seattle a little
ways and it's a suburb.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Linwood is how almost County.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one of the more red, definitely
one of the reddish counties, this side of
[SPEAKER_04]: the mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had Western Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you've always been a boundary pusher.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you've been involved with head
fest for a really long time at other
[SPEAKER_08]: events as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, but, but growing cannabis in your
front yard, when it was still illegal,
[SPEAKER_08]: but going in the direction of being legal,
uh, you know, that was, to me,
[SPEAKER_08]: that was impressive because I never had
the balls to grow in my front yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the plants would have got
taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a long time to get the balls just
to grow in my closet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, once the dam is broken,
the dam is broken.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up here, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Linwood cops have always known the
mess for kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it was just kind of part for
the course, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a plant in the front yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: My neighbors loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, wow, that's a really pretty
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: My neighbor across the street knew exactly
what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, he asked me, he says,
what are you gonna do when the cops roll
[SPEAKER_04]: out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask you about that pot plant in your front
yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told them, pot plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't have a plan, but, um, neither did I
ever get contacted by the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they actually, I'm really on the
bottom of the dead end.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come and sit down here in their cars,
eat their donuts or their sandwiches or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody paid any mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pay attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you've done all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been involved with cannabis for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, you know, when we talk about
passion for the sacred plant, I feel like
[SPEAKER_08]: you embody all of that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, over the last couple of
years, I realized that it really is a
[SPEAKER_04]: passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I stopped growing for one
reason or another, I have some pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: major health issues going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, for a long time, it just
wasn't something I could do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting to that point again,
where I'm really scaled back and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, it makes me sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: This really makes me sad when I'm not
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done for so long and it's just,
uh, so it's a source of pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just awesome pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, the most joy I've ever gotten out
of growing weed, out of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is given pot to somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have really just a weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharing with people you care about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or people that you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just giving them something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, not for the social media hits and
views, but just to give it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Behind your back shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, that's, that's the best
pleasure that I get out of growing weed is
[SPEAKER_04]: just sharing it with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having people like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: They appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, so it gives somebody a great
meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't love that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's, it's, um, God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I would never trade.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So tell us how you got started with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a matter of it was the drug
that all the kids were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did not like drinking alcohol,
hated being drunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ended up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoken weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like most of all the other kids in
the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And did you grow up in this area or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually it was born and raised in this
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Born and raised in this house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely a family home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I've lived around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worked and sailed as a merchant Marines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did a lot of parties, trunks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a girlfriend for three or four years
in Yokohama.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had more video rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I didn't even know something like
that existed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause MTV didn't exist yet, but they had
it all in Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a real cool, colorful life that,
um, that I am blessed to have had.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, cannabis really kind of takes
the cake for all of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Along your journey.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been there the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always come back to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, for a long time, I never left it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Circumstances of getting married,
having kids, you know, transitioning all
[SPEAKER_04]: of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, credit's hard to get when all you can
show them is pictures of your latest,
[SPEAKER_04]: greatest bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe we can't give a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I just fucking agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my latest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have all these assets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeds for these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just always been an adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cannabis plant can lead you to
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can lead you to the cannabis plant
or that might work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I will tell you from
just meeting people through smoking and
[SPEAKER_04]: growing and sharing pictures of each
other's weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a real cool people that,
um, eventually got me involved with hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: vests and help us with really the change
of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I spent nearly 20 years as a
volunteer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a, it's a all volunteer
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, we bought services,
rented equipment, did all that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, uh, the infrastructure was all
assembled and disassembled.
[SPEAKER_04]: The events are always run by volunteers.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: So diving into hemp vest, uh, that is one
of the most profound experiences that you
[SPEAKER_08]: can get as far as cannabis goes,
uh, because of the collective
[SPEAKER_08]: consciousness of 300,000 other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: There has never been a larger event in the
city of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_04]: 300,000 people plus or minus, uh,
420 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, hanging out in those three parts
over three days, you can combine the world
[SPEAKER_04]: series or a Superbowl or, you know,
Stanley cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm all the way in those crowds still
sold out, aren't gonna meet the attendance
[SPEAKER_04]: of a hemp vest, you know, it's hay day for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or come even less to the passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: The passion in the passion is,
um, somebody felt the day that might've
[SPEAKER_04]: been you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fashion is, is another vibration level,
vibrational level above love.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not that much more than
authenticity and passion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The passion at one of those events,
the authenticity, they're all based on,
[SPEAKER_04]: on, on love.
[SPEAKER_08]: When getting so many people together,
those are the type of events that changed
[SPEAKER_08]: the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the hemp vest and we're talking
about people that aren't there for the
[SPEAKER_08]: money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe there's a handful of people there
for the money, but that's like the 1%.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's not the real world.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like, there might be the 1%
that's out there to go try to make a buck
[SPEAKER_08]: with the people that show up at events
like hemp vest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the people that love weed,
that love cannabis or people that are
[SPEAKER_08]: curious about it, that maybe learn
something new.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, cause it was about legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about enjoying the plant for what
it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also friendship and meeting new
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, um, back to the passion with an event
so huge, so undeniably huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked throughout the decades,
almost three of them with the Seattle
[SPEAKER_04]: police, the port police, the fire
department, all of the city agencies that
[SPEAKER_04]: you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also imagine that going into
these events in the early years,
[SPEAKER_04]: skepticism on the part of the city or,
or the officials is such a, such a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: understatement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, these hippies can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think the hippies get,
uh, but yeah, people, they relate to
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, the hippies, and then they're
like the hippies there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just get high and then not smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's never been the case.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also been the state where the
cannabis is bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's, yeah, first we wanted
to have legalization and then we wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: have normalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we just want de-stigmatization
because it's normal as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing abnormal about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes the world a better place?
[SPEAKER_04]: Happiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of authenticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what helps bring those on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you what, um, the nearly 30
years that hemp has prevailed in those
[SPEAKER_04]: parts annually, there was never a major
incident.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not one gutter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not one violence incident.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not one death thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever it is that you send your thanks
and ask your hopes crumb into,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, there's just no, I don't know how to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well, I kind of do is we'd never
allowed alcohol at our events.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No alcohol, no violence.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just such a simple recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it prevailed for 29 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really something to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole Hempstress, the model that they
add.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, to have an event that successful
for that many years without major
[SPEAKER_08]: problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's almost unheard of.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you involved alcohol, that it would be
the polar opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it could have involved a for-profit
business model.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the chaos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could, could as, yeah, an amazing,
time and they are amazing times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's how we navigate the tail
end of legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so much work to again, um,
desigmatize, normalize, allow home grows
[SPEAKER_04]: like some states have.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of work to be done still
fighting for some of the laws here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really screwed up laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we were the first state to legalize
us, us in Colorado, where everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: learned from Washington and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: How to do it right now to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of the States made their own
mistakes anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over taxation being one of the biggest
over taxation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge over taxation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridiculous share of Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally rescinded the, uh, of the
excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will go into effect this July.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, along with that comes no more
taxation on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to see a Russian black
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grove.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to see a rush in medical
patient registration.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course the States going to hate all
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause this law said they're revenue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we were talking a little bit
earlier about how we live in such a
[SPEAKER_08]: special time, you know, throughout history
to be part of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like the two of us are,
are both doing not only what our 18 year
[SPEAKER_08]: old selves would be like super proud of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're doing what we were supposed to
do when we came here, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: to this planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like when we came here,
we were meant to do what we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, I reflect on that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that destiny is something that I
think we're all given born with,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, or at least given to us as a model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a possible thing for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not all cut out to be rocket
scientists, computer programmers,
[SPEAKER_04]: or cannabis growers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so definitely, definitely,
I believe destiny plays a role in our
[SPEAKER_04]: lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't trade it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't think of much I'd trade it for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't trade the cannabis, you know,
the cannabis lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it is real interesting how it's
changed, how we were in the shadows for
[SPEAKER_08]: the longest time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had to be in the shadows because of
the risk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much risk and that's changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now the younger generation,
they don't even know the risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know the risks and they know
the glamour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and all of the stuff in the middle is
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is that stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the passion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the love.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why we got started with this from the
beginning?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the passion's falling out for profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's falling out for glamour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out all the those weed events with
the fricking tuxes and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: five peas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what's cool in style
anymore because I'm not a budding young
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis executive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, those juice can dress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But where's the passion for the,
not just the passion for the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the passion that this plant brings to
others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you're passionate about something as
healing and healthy as cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard not to be passionate just about
loving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a part of our society that has
long been overlooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, peace, love, rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with peace and love?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting how our society is picking up
on these changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them are passing muster
pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are figuring out, oh,
that's not killing anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: The sky is appalling.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the collective effort of so many
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: You and I included.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoned hippies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoned hippies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do a damn thing.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoned hippies and just regular people
that said that this thing is okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now there's more than 50% of the
United States is in approval of
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational cannabis, which is where it
should be.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a hundred years ago, they didn't care.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: A hundred years from now, they won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: We care right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to make it happen right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what do you think about national
legalization?
[SPEAKER_04]: Federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: Federal legalization, interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's really sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no reason that it should be
scheduled.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all about de-schedule.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to de-schedule it and treat it
like we treat alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot safer than alcohol and tobacco
for one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But another thing, being able to use
interstate commerce, I think that takes
[SPEAKER_08]: away the black market to a degree in a
good way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think interstate commerce allows us to
sell to other states.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's silly that it's not
treated like alcohol or tobacco.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to reschedule it as a
schedule three drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about logic or common
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Common sense isn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't see enough backdoor
money politically to make it a thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: a guy is anti-cannabis and you can vote on
it based on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of money in it for states
and municipalities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should they be able to have an actual
market?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: These propped up markets, they're not
functional.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing the best quality product just
knocked down penny by penny by penny.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the top shelf weed now seems to be the
shit weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy that's got 27 different crows,
multi-state operators.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got the most money in marketing.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think we need to get back to our
roots to a degree with boutique flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also there's a lot of people
prioritizing things like purple flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think these things are fads.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that purple flower is nice,
but I don't think it's any nicer than
[SPEAKER_08]: green.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to go back and look at the
effect of the plant and the taste of the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those two things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for me, all the other stuff is
just hypoenemia.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, yeah, we could talk about the
way the ash burns.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could talk about all these different
things, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_08]: how does it make you feel and how does it
taste?
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my pot to smell, to taste like it
smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to smell like it tastes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two first olfactory senses
that you can bring to bear if you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is so subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's definitely a subjective
trait or quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, your Blues 13 smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a tiny little bit of haze,
the terpenaline, limonade.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a little bit of limonade.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has very heavy fruit, blueberry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have quite the combination and
it's good that they all, they sink well.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go well together.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that was one of my male breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That really baffled me that breeding
males.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was smoking and we were looking at
pictures of weed and getting eyes
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere in my partner's house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, why are people breed for males?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I obviously knew all of the answers
because they didn't want 18 million seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to be able to sell their butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking, well, there's ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to have a house on either quarter of
the 38.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so much more simple than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have a safe, pollen-tight room to
flower your flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have some stringent dress codes,
18 rules, clean it, shower, shampoo,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not that hard if you put some
work into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just like growing it any other way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just takes some work.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you put in, you get out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was real surprised with that blue 13
male on the back of your book,
[SPEAKER_04]: your latest book.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to talk about breeding more,
but let's talk about the books.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys have seen the breeding book,
this is my single favorite.
[SPEAKER_08]: Favorite photo of all time that's ever
been taken of a male plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people think it's reversed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten a lot of comments that they're
like, no, that's a reverse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy is the one who grew that,
bred it, took the photo of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And ever since I saw that photo,
I've been in love with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's just a special photo.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing quite like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The beauty of that is you captured it in
the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can only be captured on film.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was at its peak.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was like right before it started
just dumping, hauling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dumping, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just, it's super healthy,
super happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's green.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's an amazing photo.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, forever that'll be
remembered.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least by me and by the people who read
my book is one of the best photos of a
[SPEAKER_04]: male ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I take it happily and willily.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there's, it was actually I went
to you to talk about reversing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, I don't know, a year or two
after this probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, that was a while back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no chemicals, no silver sulfonate
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, there's no reversing tricks
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: All kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's so many different ways to skin
a cat and still get good results.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you started breeding with males and
how many years ago?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many years ago was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it's been quite a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: About 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you did, you made a mimosa.
[SPEAKER_08]: You made a mimosa before the most of the
people known to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is with that, it's like,
fuck, man, I can't put this on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hadn't been fucking back crossed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just, I didn't do the stuff to
stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of dudes that just chuck
pollen and fucking now they're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or accidentally make seeds and now they're
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: That happens too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That happens too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, throughout history,
you know, there's other people that just
[SPEAKER_08]: buy seeds and call themselves breers and
it's the hype train.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I don't hate on anybody and
I don't call anybody out for whatever they
[SPEAKER_08]: do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could care less.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to focus on me and improve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Constantly trying to improve myself
because I'm not there yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have a ways to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got this book.
[SPEAKER_08]: You took photos in the book.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're an amazing photographer,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I think we got some good pollen
shots and you, you know, you do the pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: with the desiccant, so I could,
so I'm reading through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the part about, uh, one of the
universities that have been studying
[SPEAKER_04]: probably have been in Israel or somewhere
and then their methods for collecting and
[SPEAKER_04]: storing pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these, these guys been to my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's just hit or miss double off
with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: In common sense, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: In common sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of it, common sense isn't so
common, but a lot of the, see,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you think about stuff, you know,
and use common sense, you can be
[SPEAKER_08]: successful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do I get it dry?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know it was still dry?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to open that bottle in my
house or the seal.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know it's still good?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, it's all about putting out a
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to put out shit,
put out a crappy product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was, that was a whole reason
for me not selling mimosa seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't stabilized them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody came along, use the name though,
snooze or lose.
[SPEAKER_08]: They, yeah, you had a look, was it La
Rosa?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Luna Rosa?
[SPEAKER_04]: Luna Rosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's his, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Belushi?
[SPEAKER_04]: His girl Luna Rosa now something like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he took the law off the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was La Luna Rosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real purple anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just, they're not a flavoid,
flavonoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really, I don't know what it is
that they can add.
[SPEAKER_04]: To something ingested, you know,
by spoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good, it's an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's, you know, and there's
nothing wrong with purple, even in the,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the full palette of different
color possibilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we were talking about pink
flower the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about SFV actually,
it'll turn pink at the end and some
[SPEAKER_08]: flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if you go longer, you're making seeds
with SFV.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certain genetics, they turn pink.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that purple is beautiful,
but I don't think that it's more,
[SPEAKER_08]: for me, it's not more special.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for me personally, it's just not my
preference.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing wrong that other people
think that it's amazing and they love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what the market standard is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause whatever it is, it is, you know,
whatever the people want, the people want,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, you can change it by showing
them something different and maybe better,
[SPEAKER_08]: but then what is better, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so subjective.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think we're a little bit
older, so we like the hazes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like the more uplifting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, I love all of it, but I definitely
love sativas and I love that uplifting
[SPEAKER_08]: flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's something that's special about
the nose on some of those that are really
[SPEAKER_08]: strong and just really loud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't get enough of them sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, but, but it's also, you have to have
a pretty good tolerance for some of that
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a couch lot tolerance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's, you know, you can get paranoid
if you smoke too much of our competitions.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're looking out the window.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hiding from the cops a little bit out
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we put meth in my weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot on TV, on the news these
days, a lot of reports.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are so vogue and just
ridiculously obviously aimed at an agenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, the science really isn't
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: On either side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely more science needs to be
brought to bear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something going back to federal
legalization, or at least interstate
[SPEAKER_04]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a big help when we're having
these discussions, whether they be
[SPEAKER_04]: political or legal or just societal,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That we use accurate information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was telling you about when I was first
diagnosed with cancer, then it was a real
[SPEAKER_04]: bad cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still fighting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I found out was it's like,
well thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm this weed guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows me from hemp that I was
staved, the guy with the weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that was a long hair and really
the weed hit me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't I just do what they all do and
just cure myself?
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I was kind of skeptical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was always all skeptical, but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they said they needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of my supernumerosity or Indica,
this will help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, whether it helped him or not,
it probably helped me with the
[SPEAKER_04]: benevolence.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I found out is, you know,
the whole gram a day, 30 days or 60 days,
[SPEAKER_04]: I did four grams a day because I already
knew I had a heavy tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did them for 120 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems as if it didn't have an effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then about that same time,
just a little bit after my first round of
[SPEAKER_04]: chemo and then my surgery, I discovered
that certain types of cannabinoids can
[SPEAKER_04]: kill certain types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you think about that again,
logically or with common sense,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's another truth to that,
which has been verified with empirical
[SPEAKER_04]: data is that certain types of cannabinoids
can exacerbate certain types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This weed can fuck you up and can kill
your cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This weed can kill you through your
cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who'd have thought, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of my little rant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been online much lately,
but my rant is whenever I see somebody,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially if they're trying to sell RSO
or Pico or whatever, well, you have the
[SPEAKER_04]: skills, cancer, cure yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But dude, we did this 20 years ago,
30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already said all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know it's not true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, there are still a lot
of folks out there pushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was factual and robbing people of a
chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's had a longer life if nothing else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people personally, throughout my
hemp vest family over 30 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: said, that's right, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about big pharma, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we watched those people die a death.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really the saddest part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it was sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: To the individual's body chemistry,
there's so many things and so many
[SPEAKER_08]: factors.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not straightforward.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a one size fits all solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was, we wouldn't have cancer
anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it does work for certain types of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been shown to work for certain types
of cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also certain ailments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crohn's disease, man, it's amazing for
Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then other things, not so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then every once in a while,
you get somebody who's cured from certain
[SPEAKER_08]: things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's so individual.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're just scratching the surface of
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's tied into the whole federal
legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it needs to be federally legal
so we can study it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are allowing some studies,
but they're not allowing enough studies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once federal legalization goes,
or decriminalization, or rescheduling,
[SPEAKER_08]: any of those, to be honest, we can study
it a lot more in the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're way ahead of us in Israel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Way ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Israel and other countries as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we are making progress.
[SPEAKER_08]: No doubt we're making progress since we
first met.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, geez, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Met in your uncle's fortress of a garage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was growing a bunch of my genetics,
and we got some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Won a cup with one of them, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Amsterdam in 2012.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's amazing the things that bring us
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's amazing how many people you meet
along the way that you meet one time,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then other people, I talk to you more
than I talk to Uncle Pat.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you meet people, and you connect
with people, and there's some synergy,
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're into breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had a lot of good conversations over
the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: In photography, we went out to squim at
Canter organics, and you took photos when
[SPEAKER_08]: we were running the autos out there with
me and Kyle.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Marlon, I think Marlon Asher came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a good trip on the warm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marlon, yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Marlon Asher, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally good times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like arguing with you about being a
breeder, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, I swear I'm not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're more of a breeder than most of the
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get the breeder card with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I'm concerned, you're a real
breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're actually concerned about the
things that matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so many guys are more worried
about what it looks like on Instagram than
[SPEAKER_08]: what they're actually doing to the plant
or creating or fetal hunting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and a lot of people don't understand
the part about breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: To really be a breeder, you should be
phenotyping and selecting and finding
[SPEAKER_08]: winners.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not doing that, you're just a
seed producer in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can call yourself whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to pagal on anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, the real
process of breeding is the selection
[SPEAKER_08]: process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what makes it special.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, that's one of the best parts is
you never know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a lottery to a degree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you might know your line so well.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to go, OK, I'm going to get
something like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: But sometimes it's just a lottery.
[SPEAKER_08]: You pop the 50 seeds and you never know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe you get nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe you get all winners.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes you get exactly what you
think.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes you get completely different
stuff that you're like, where the heck did
[SPEAKER_08]: this come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: I had none of this raspberry in any of my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think fruit pops up, different types of
fruit, mangoes, guan livers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love when those pop up and then I love
banana too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Banana is good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like smoking banana flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never really had much luck with
satisfaction with banana strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow big and clunky and chunky,
which I obviously like.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the flavor, I've never really tasted
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How dammit if it says banana and they want
to taste banana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so I did a banana Skittles cross and
the Bananazee House of Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd have to have them send you some.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the selection that was selected,
because you get it all over the place,
[SPEAKER_08]: with the selections, there was banana
chip.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was like banana cream.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was like plantain, like a green
banana kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was like a couple different
variations of like ripe banana.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the candy banana.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that candy banana is what I'm all
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want it to smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, you know, the banana ruts
candy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want it to taste like that, where it's
almost like fake chirp banana.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then even the extracts, when you smoke
it, it has that fake banana chirp.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I, you know, but what I did my
crosses, I made regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used multiple males.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that gives you a wide variety of
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're a breeder and someone who's
actually doing selection, you can go in
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can go, okay, well, this cross is
like chem 91.
[SPEAKER_08]: It leans towards the chem, but it has a
candy banana, or it has an unripe banana,
[SPEAKER_08]: has a very green banana taste,
or has banana chip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or banana custard.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you get some of those banana
custardy ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love, you know, it's kind of a
choosier of interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's part of the fun of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a while there, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should talk about multiple males.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never really known how to pose that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or to who or where.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the advantage other than variety?
[SPEAKER_08]: So increasing genetic diversity in the F1
populations, when you're crossing things
[SPEAKER_08]: together for the first time, if you don't
know the breeding lines and you're trying
[SPEAKER_08]: to select a male, me personally,
I wouldn't select just one male.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would select probably three males that
represent different expressions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, it's like, once you know
your lines, you're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_08]: this is the male.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the male that I envision is the
male that I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this one's squattier.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't flower right away or whatever
your goals are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like the way this stacks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's so many things,
but like for me, I did the sage and sour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, I used three different
males that represented three different
[SPEAKER_08]: things that I liked.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and then when we did that,
the populations, now you have more
[SPEAKER_08]: variety.
[SPEAKER_08]: And diversity, so you can pick it to
choose your own adventure again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, and then the more seeds you pop,
I have large amounts of seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, okay, we can pop a hundred
seeds and we can seek what we like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's nothing good there,
we don't have to go for another hundred.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's good, maybe we can pop 300.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, and you can do that on a
smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do it on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some friends that are popping a
thousand seeds one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a little extreme
personally, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess that goes down to
resources.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes down to resources.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, what you're willing to do
as far as time, cause all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_08]: very time consuming and obviously
expensive, you know, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_08]: resources and is that the best use of your
resources?
[SPEAKER_08]: 18,000 or 25,000 seed feed on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have the space and the time and
the money, maybe it's worth it for
[SPEAKER_08]: unicorns.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of stuff you can find within a
good population, you know, you might not
[SPEAKER_08]: find that unicorn the next whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you may not find an ex OG Kush,
but a lot of that stuff is lottery anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like obviously like the OG Kush,
you know, I feel like something like that
[SPEAKER_08]: has very recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that one was a very, you know,
whereas ChemDog, you look at all those
[SPEAKER_08]: chem seeds, those were all fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't a winner, winner chicken dinner
lottery ticket.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the, okay, we popped the first one
and it was a, we popped the other ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were pretty good winners.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Sour Diesel came out of that as,
you know, the offspring of the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that so certain things,
they just have it in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And other thing is it's the lottery where
it's that one in 18,000 or one in 5,000 or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: The loudberry that Jason Midnight Rider
hunted of mine, we popped thousands of
[SPEAKER_08]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: He got a 10 pack and found the winner in
one 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, and sometimes it's the
way it was grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes you grow something out one
time and the next time you grow it out,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not the same too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's having to grow stuff out multiple
times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that always makes me wonder,
well, where does, where does the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: From one time or the next?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's so many things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those chemistry changes that
happen within the plant as the plant
[SPEAKER_08]: matures.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're getting maturity.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why from going from seed to the
first generation, you can get a completely
[SPEAKER_08]: different expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then even the next generation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we grow it out multiple times and we
change our minds on what we think is the
[SPEAKER_08]: best along the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think looking at data plus actually
being able to compare side by side,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's probably the best, you know,
but like you grow something out three
[SPEAKER_08]: times and you know, that third time,
okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you may have to treat that plant a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the plant needs to be thinned
out more here or it can be pushed harder.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can feed it more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're calling it a generation,
another seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just cloddled.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm talking cloddled generation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll do cloddled generation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from, from the initial seed start,
I, I've been debating this recently,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I always get rid of that seed start
and I don't grow the seed start out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I start with the first clonal
generation and what we do is we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: basically take that seed, start grow big
enough to take clones off it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now we're getting five clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to clone those, get rid of the
initial seed start because you don't get
[SPEAKER_08]: that anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want to see what I can't have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if you're selling seeds, that could
be valuable if somebody's growing those
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds in a field to know what kind of
expressions they're getting.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're trying to sell clones and
you want to license genetics, like the
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff that we're doing, when you're
talking about licensing genetics,
[SPEAKER_08]: you want something that's, you're growing
at this representation of what you'll get,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to see in the future,
what your customers are going to see,
[SPEAKER_08]: what people are going to see, you know,
for years to come hopefully.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why we start with the first
generation and grow it out to its three
[SPEAKER_08]: clonal generations before we really make
the decision on what's the winner.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to get you down the Bay area to
check out the facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like we're doing some really
incredible stuff, you know, and I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: excited to share it with people like
yourself that we've been talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: this kind of stuff forever and turning it
into reality is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, just seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very passionate for it again,
as we keep going back to, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: can't think of anything that requires
passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a negative endeavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, so throughout this journey,
you've learned a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I feel like we've all learned,
we're young.
[SPEAKER_08]: We think we're so smart and we think we
know everything and we're so invincible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as we get older, we realize we're
not invincible.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fragile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know very little compared to what we
could know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, you know, forever we're
learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what would be your one piece of advice
for the younger generation that's coming
[SPEAKER_08]: into the industry that's passionate about
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow your heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't follow your wallet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fuck the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to make money in this
industry, maybe someday you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see these multi-state operators
with millions and millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_04]: bankroll behind them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, you see those guys fall on
by the wayside really rapidly too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they don't have the passion for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they don't have the passion for the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't think they, I don't think a
lot of these big operators have an
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding of, of the power of this
planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just say follow your heart,
man, follow your heart and have good
[SPEAKER_04]: intents and always be pure when it comes
to the plant and just be honest about what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're spraying it with something,
be honest about what you're spraying it
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, um, if you're having issues,
good help.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many people out there that want
to tell you everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's a lot of folks out there
that know everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing how people, how many people
out there know so much about growing
[SPEAKER_04]: really good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's, um, it's something that takes
some passion and, and commitment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, just don't get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you have that, I think it's as
simple as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Authenticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Authenticity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got quite the guitar collection.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a few of them back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got some nice fenders and yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always been a fender guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more proud of the Hempfest artwork up
on the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the vet was just like no other.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you've done other events too,
not just Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, sitting in a friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was, uh, look, I love growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guy needs, guy needs to, um, fix his
lights or his exhaust or some shit in his
[SPEAKER_04]: room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm working in a, uh, working for Sean
Green.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might even know him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had the first I-502 license in the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fair pals, he had a dispensary pretty
close.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whenever I was out of weed or needed
something or I run over to his place,
[SPEAKER_04]: buy some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pals, you know, talking about growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a bunch of weed growing in the back
of his dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and I was up working on lighting
or something, some company giving him a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: In comes one of the vet tenders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, Dave, you got to check this old guy
out, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got like the purplest weed I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're in a can.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in a paint can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went out and bought it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show me his weed and purple as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a strain called an old,
old Toby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't go much further than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just stop that old Toby.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of history with that scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all over the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, the weed was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, we chatted for a while on these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, do you do this work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a carpenter all my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you need done?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, so well, here's my address.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never went and come over and need to
look at my exhaust in my grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how Bob and I hooked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I could do the system, helped him
upgrade.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a pretty good room designer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were sitting down in his basement
one night, smoking Cali mist, the real
[SPEAKER_04]: Cali mist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So real deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cali mist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting back to the, to the cannabis
events.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob looks over at me and says,
Dave, what do you think about Canacon?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't say anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to figure out how to get to my
phone and buy that domain real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canacon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's dumb, Bob.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like Comic-Con, but for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just couldn't come up with any more
excuses.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fucking good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was how Canacon got started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob was always a sales guy and,
uh, had a history of running home shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So home and garden shows basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was the perfect fit to get into the
run out of trade show.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys killed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: For cannabis, we killed it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys toured all over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And SOPs, that's where I came in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Bob had a three by five box of file
cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, this is your, uh,
this is your seat or round customer
[SPEAKER_04]: relations.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would, it's a box of cards,
Bob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well you put the name and the number
on the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You call them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't sell anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it to the back of the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on in the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep calling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep calling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a note on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a note.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time date called would decide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it in the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, dude, we got a fucking software
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I computer is like, man, you can't run a
business like this without being online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we, uh, he related to, we've got
some CRN software, um, the website that we
[SPEAKER_04]: had somebody built for us was a clunker as
usual.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was some chasing down of,
uh, IP guys that became my role on helping
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Navigate the old jungle of IP pros,
you know, but we got a couple of good
[SPEAKER_04]: companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the biggest thing was the digital map.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, people want to know where they're
going to be in relationship to the
[SPEAKER_04]: bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot of traffic to the bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to know where they're in
relationship to their competitors or just
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they definitely want to get the booth
at the sales from Sullivan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got guys, we got a big paper CAD
drawing on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a wall of our office and the guys
would go check mark something or that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what hold for three days guys
are selling booths out from under each
[SPEAKER_04]: other left and right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when the guy calls back with the
check, he said, I want to pay for my booth
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, well, um, I got you this gray one over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot better than the one you chose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, that's not a way to fucking
where you do not build a clientele that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was another country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I never, I never, I ever, I never saw a
deal like that.
It was not a production.
It was a lot of work that we did.
I think they were, I think it was,
I think it was a really big part of the
production.
They'll make the books.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be able to do everything.
Like you said, the, the, the, the,
the full broadcast and then the,
the full history of the, the, the,
the.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, there's always the
publicity and you know, long haired stoner
[SPEAKER_04]: hippie trying to sell stuff to other long
haired stoner hippies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys had a good run.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be an interesting road.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole lot of shows that are
going under.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were at the end of the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That didn't last long.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some details behind that one too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still perfectly viable event that
should still be around.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dudes that put it on were authentic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, see, you've been a part of two
different events, annual events,
[SPEAKER_08]: than one that was on tour.
[SPEAKER_08]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of went all over.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think the secret recipe for
success is?
[SPEAKER_08]: In the event space?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the event space.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a few things.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, you need to know rules and
regs in that region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Public smoking allowed, public
consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you buy or sell at the site that
you're producing this event on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the state or the city allows
it, will the event center allow it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always been a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the state says, but the local,
but yeah, but this is our building,
[SPEAKER_04]: we say no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely know where you're going and
what you can do once you get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the biggest thing because now you
can design an event that fits the
[SPEAKER_04]: parameters of what you're able to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you're able to do what you're designing
originally intended.
[SPEAKER_04]: That and then else outreach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see people straight up selling weed on
Facebook, selling seeds on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the craziest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: The seed thing for me, because it's like I
sell seeds legally.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't use Meta for marketing to sell
the seeds yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it's a head product,
it's still a gray area with Meta for
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing, is that what you called it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Meta, which is- Oh, Meta.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't sell my seeds legally through
Meta right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a gray area.
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't let me do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can promote my book.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can promote my podcast, but I cannot
sell seeds and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do see other people doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing like the guerrilla marketing
style and doing it until they get caught,
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We type cannabis in one of our posts,
something we're taking down the next day,
[SPEAKER_04]: shut down.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an event that we believe has a
good time monitoring our pages and turning
[SPEAKER_04]: us in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems to be sport among some of these
businesses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of haters out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they would all just focus on making
themselves better, but you got to ignore
[SPEAKER_08]: them, unfortunately, if that's just the
way you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go back to allowing us to build
stronger models, stronger business models.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, your enemies are the ones who make
you strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of people don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your enemies are the ones who make you
successful and strong.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so everything comes with a grain of
salt, but I think the people around you
[SPEAKER_08]: are the ones that influence and make you
who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's okay too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, they are who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are your environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are what you eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's as simple as that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Components change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things boil to the top of the pot as
they're in the process of cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also those are kind of my things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, the cream rises to the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may be in that pot with a bunch of
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not sure about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take on the essences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take on the other qualities and come up to
the top of the pot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fight your way if you have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, I think for me, one of the
things was I was told like, you want to
[SPEAKER_08]: make life easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want your kids to have an easy life.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I've learned is struggle is what
defines you and struggle is what makes you
[SPEAKER_08]: strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so going through struggle is not
necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hard work is definitely good for people.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a lot more hard work out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the younger generation can relax
that work ethic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in a couple of generations,
we can get it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a natural progression.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cycle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as far as your breathing philosophies,
let's dive into that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the first thing that I don't have any
of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so I mean, you don't have any,
but you do believe in breeding males.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do believe in doing male selections.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, as far as male selections,
what do you look for in a male?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it's all personal preference,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I like, I like a nice pointy
spear-shaped nub.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to see that in my males.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a lot of males that are people's
freaking unicorns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting to me that they have
some little tiny top nubs and kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: wither away to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would think that a more vigorous
chunky plant would yield the same in the
[SPEAKER_04]: female or vigorous chunky plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was just that physical, that first
physical observation of the, of the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that helped me decide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, which was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aromatics are a bit of a thing with males,
but they're important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, definitely important.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Colflex combination of, of terps and
flavonoids that you named off as you were
[SPEAKER_04]: smelling that blue 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't smell any of that while they're
little baby males waiting to dust.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you get a lot of green.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a little stem rub and white.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only get a little stem rub and get
something, something in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a little bit, a lot of green.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of green.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, for the stem rub, but for me,
I've always gotten chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the time you get, like if it's
orange, you'll get orange.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, or if it's, there's certain
specific things, hazy ones, sometimes you
[SPEAKER_08]: can get that, the haze on there,
you know, and, but yeah, definitely like
[SPEAKER_08]: orange pops and lemon pops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Except the citrus ones really pop,
but the subtleties don't come out until
[SPEAKER_08]: the flower's grown out and you can
actually smell the flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The female flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: The female flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's where it goes back to time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just bringing good wheat takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time and patience.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the patience.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, life is short.
[SPEAKER_08]: The irony is life is short, but you have
to have patience.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, victim.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, at a point that was where I was
at in my life, I had plenty of patience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kanekon was doing really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't have to go out and hustle
twice as hard as before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that allowed me, I was blessed
with the ability to have patience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us a blessing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was what got me into reading males
was why aren't people talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: reading males?
[SPEAKER_04]: They read this with that, this with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did they read it?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple of females.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one was the male?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one was the female?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all of those questions popped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I want to read some fucking males
and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and taking photos of males,
you've taken some amazing photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of great photographers out
there, but not a lot of great
[SPEAKER_08]: photographers that have taken pictures of
males.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're under values.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the photography opportunities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the window is also short where they're
in their peak to where they look amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really, the guy who's doing the
photography is probably the photographer
[SPEAKER_08]: typically.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've had photographers come in and
get some of the stuff of my males,
[SPEAKER_08]: but man, if you are a photographer and you
have males, it just makes it even better
[SPEAKER_08]: because there's a very short window of
when it's in its peak.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and then when the window, basically
when the grenades have all opened up and
[SPEAKER_08]: all those pollen sacks have opened up and
the pollen is released, it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_08]: looking flower too.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, male.
[SPEAKER_08]: For a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: For a minute, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just the Petritus or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: So pollen turns brown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pollen turns brown.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to really, you know, basically
separate that pollen pretty quickly once
[SPEAKER_08]: they start up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something up like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: But once they're open and you hit them,
for me, that's one of the most satisfying
[SPEAKER_08]: experiences is when you have a big male or
reverse female and you have the huge cola
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's opened up where you know the
pollen is going to fly and you hit it or
[SPEAKER_08]: you shake it and that pollen just flows,
whether it's in a room or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Outdoors is even more impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was down south of San Diego
with my buddies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were doing the, my buddy created
the, well not created, but he decided to
[SPEAKER_08]: use the leaf blower with the mason jar of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you shake it behind the leaf blower
and you know, there's videos online from
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the leaf blower is turned around
backwards to be a vacuole?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well a leaf blower blows, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So through the back of it, it sucks air.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, put the pollen in, the dry
pollen through there and it just shoots it
[SPEAKER_08]: out over the field.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and this is, this was done off
season.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But to see the wave of pollen,
the plants and you know, it's just locking
[SPEAKER_08]: on and you're making a ton of seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But even though there's a wave in the room
that kind of floats above the canopy of
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen, really goes from edge to edge and
you smack that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like to because I grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you do the infinity tents now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we have something in common.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like those infinity tents.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Olympic controllers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you get the controllers dialed in,
they do everything for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're really straightforward and
breezy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're looking for breeding
chambers, if you have a house,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can separate your stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But even if you have a facility,
see infinity tents work really well for
[SPEAKER_08]: keeping your plants separate.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to maintain the size of a
room for seven plants or 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well one day they make them in different
shapes and sizes, often in different
[SPEAKER_08]: needs.
[SPEAKER_08]: The little two by fours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a couple of those still that were
hanging around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put my mails in there and just flower my
mails up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely taking care and caution with my
exhaust systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once those mails are big and they're ready
to go, I take a big estimation jar,
[SPEAKER_04]: quarter pound jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to call them, clean the hell out
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do all of the sanitary stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I turn off all of my air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lysol because they have badly little
cheapo's headpans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn all the air off.
[SPEAKER_04]: No movement as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zip the zipper open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just enough for me to get up in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I take that big ass fucking top cola
and a couple of the other branches and I
[SPEAKER_04]: squeeze them together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, losing a little pollens floating
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Upside down with that mason jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I could hold on to one
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Upside down with that mason jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: You break the stem and then you just give
it a slap.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a slap and you're watching it all
roll down the side of that jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll it around a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a slap in the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gently pull it out of there as you're
pulling pollen with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you just cap it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lock everything up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go out on the front porch or wherever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not to, you know, contaminate your
indoor air too much until it'll give it a
[SPEAKER_04]: spank on a lid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just watch that stuff roll again,
you know, on the sides of the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Solid yellow wave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite part of depollinating a
male.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I collect it and clean it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people would love to hear
about how you clean your pollen and store
[SPEAKER_08]: your pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's valuable.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't talk about that enough on my show,
but you know, I think you're an expert in
[SPEAKER_08]: that regard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't you share how you collect
from that point, how you separate it,
[SPEAKER_08]: clean it, store it, dry it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of little black bugs I don't get
indoors that I get outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what they are, but another good
reason to grow indoors with your males.
[SPEAKER_04]: But pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take, you know, six or eight sheets and
put them on a table, something like this
[SPEAKER_04]: table right here of just typing paper,
you know, printer paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll take a head of a round,
rimmed, a columnar, a silver screen,
[SPEAKER_04]: fine screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plop that on top of the jar, turn it all
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bap in my pollen down the sides of the jar
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the other way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bap, smack, bap.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do it for a while until you get,
until you feel like you get everything
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to roll out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I've got a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of tap the sides both ways to get it
into a singular file.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll crease the paper down both sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make, end up making like the old cocaine
things, the folds with the snow seals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're eating that little diagonal
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a big coke pan, but snow seals are
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I basically get a big snow seal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Powder envelope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Powder envelope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point I'll sit it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a bunch of desiccant beads in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Color changing desiccant beads.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're easy to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon has them all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are just the plain beads.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not inside the packets.
[SPEAKER_04]: The packets would just kill up all unstuck
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the plain beads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I squish them around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seal that little pouch up and stick
something on top of it for a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: a couple of days, come back, sit out all
the beads.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've turned all pink by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So type the chains of beads, sit them out
on that same little sieve I was talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about, the little round screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Redo the process stuff but back on the
paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see if there's debris in your
bond.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the first thing you would do is
pick out a little tweezer or something to
[SPEAKER_04]: pick out any debris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing indoor I get very little.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not beating the heck out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm getting really virtually no leaf
debris.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you've got some pollen and it's
pretty damn dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do that about three or four times until
I get literally no pink beads back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take a week or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to do it out in my garage where it's
cool in the 60s or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fight with moisture out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have a way to mitigate or
to control the whole environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I'm thinking about adding
back that little two by 10 tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can throw humidity in there or
take it out just as easily as I can
[SPEAKER_04]: control the temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty good environmentally
controlled pollen curing, if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had never thought of the idea of curing
pollen until I read your book or that
[SPEAKER_04]: section of your book.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, shit, these guys are doing
everything I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They stole it from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big university in Amsterdam or
somewhere, those assholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little funnel and then you put it in
glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it in glass vial.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to mix a good amount of the
color-changing desiccant bees along with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seal it tight as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I make the faster little labels
with the little crow on them with the
[SPEAKER_04]: brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this, time, zap harvested on such and
such a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're a brand blue crow,
correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've had that since I've known you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I remember the first photos I took
that got were like in a drop box type
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue crow photo or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a blue crow for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know why it was a random thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a shot actually out the window of
my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a crow bending down eating a
peanut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just clicked it and going through my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Days later, I said, that's a really cool
picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd make a nice logo or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how blue crow was born.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crow eating a peanut on the side of the
road.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you've made a living as a
photographer, too, you worked as a
[SPEAKER_08]: photographer for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't really touch too much on that
other than saying you were included in my
[SPEAKER_08]: book, but you've done tons of photo work
throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got stuff in high times that I don't
even- I heard you've been in books that
[SPEAKER_08]: authors have accredited you properly as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need to throw them out of the
bus, but I've heard that you've been in
[SPEAKER_08]: some books where you weren't credited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Several.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Several of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys, I'm not sure which one's
worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just plain old thievery,
but then there's the IP theft that people
[SPEAKER_04]: don't get.
[SPEAKER_04]: That goes to the Zs, all of the Zs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tells them there's a brand here that
uses the Mr. Yuck sticker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Mr. Yuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's straight up brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: He changed the name, same symbol.
[SPEAKER_04]: We paid a ton of money with the candies,
another event that may not have come to
[SPEAKER_04]: fruition over the next several years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody, a big company, big testing lab
in California, decided they were going to
[SPEAKER_04]: change the letters from NNIES to NNYS,
candies.
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, theirs is a real lame way to
spell the candies.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second way is still steel initiative.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not big with that turfties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The industry has kind of been built on
that with genetics wise, people renaming
[SPEAKER_08]: and Panku.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at Runtz, Lemon Sherry, Gelato,
and Gelato 33 in the comparisons where
[SPEAKER_08]: people have just cut fished other people
for whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not just the only one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, OG Kush, it's really sad that it's
gone that way and you can never really
[SPEAKER_08]: trust it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also what is really what is
subjective.
[SPEAKER_08]: To the individual and what they've been
given, unless you got it from the breeder,
[SPEAKER_08]: who knows?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you got this awesome cut and it's
called this, but really it went through
[SPEAKER_08]: seven different people, got renamed along
the way and it's not that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe it's a sugar burden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing out a small batch right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, five medium sized plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a friend of mine who's a
genuine friend, great girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, she's like, I keep
forgetting the name of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is the name of that
stranger?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Adogfcook.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Adogfcook?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I don't know, but it's alien dog
times forum cut cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: How else do you shorten something like
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Adogfcook.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's, why don't we just call it this?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I kind of like Adogfcook.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's catchy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you, if you, if you're into
genetics, you'll be like, get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know it's alien dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know forum cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Adogfcook just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it, but it's not thievery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: She told me, she says, I couldn't change
the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I says, I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't, you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then nothing out of my garden is going
to get renamed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took a minute, but she got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it goes back to authenticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes back to thievery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I rename it, now it's not obsolete
genetics strain anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It means I stole it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but Obs has had a lot of that happen
over his career.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obsolete.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, is he still out and working?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, he's supposed to come by next week
and we're going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him I said hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to meet him someday.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love the Adogfcook.
[SPEAKER_08]: Adogfcook.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to show this clip to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's just a really good guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people have really tried.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a great breeder by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: His work has been abused by other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, it's so funny how people are
so easily willing to take other people's
[SPEAKER_08]: genetics and put their name on it or call
the thing something different than what it
[SPEAKER_08]: really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just call their shit somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: We live in a sad world though,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say it's a choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joey, tell my son as he's going off to
work in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happiness is a choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is ripping people's genetics off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is a fucking choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will leave you with any happiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this podcast is actually a two-part
podcast filmed on the 12th and on the
[SPEAKER_08]: 13th.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were able to sit down because of Dave's
health.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did it in two, two batches.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did the first hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you're going to watch the second
hour and a half, but before the second
[SPEAKER_08]: part of our podcast, here's some messages
from his friends and family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everyone, Rachelle, the writer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give a huge heartfelt thank
you to Dave for taking a chance on me when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still young in my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: CannaCon was one of the very first press
passes I ever received and was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first cannabis shows I went to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in Seattle in 2017 that I
realized my destiny of being a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: journalist and a steward of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not for Dave and his support,
I don't know that I would be where I am
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't believe that you're gone,
but you just did so much good for this
[SPEAKER_01]: community and for the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm forever grateful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So walk along through this beautiful part
along the water on the way to Oregon for a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only seems fitting to make the video to
commemorate Dave and all he's done for
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant and what he means to this
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be missed, never forgotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: But think about Dave, how much he loved
the plant, how much he loved people
[SPEAKER_03]: involved with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how honest he was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for bringing people together from
multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: From HempFest to CannaCon to just being an
all out great dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, just a tribute to my friend,
Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you were a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met you at the Seattle HempFest and we
just kind of hit it off and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained friendship with me for all
those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had a good impact, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just a really quality person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always hard to say goodbye to a
friend, but the truth is you never say
[SPEAKER_00]: goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: The memories stay with you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm grateful that you reached out to
me for some assistance when you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through your struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just lets you know that you have faith
and trust in the relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't turn out the way I'd hoped
it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really had hoped you succeeded with that
battle, but you succeeded in touching us
[SPEAKER_00]: as friends and you succeeded in touching
the world by being a good human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna miss you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the afterlife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Jennifer Allen, the Dope Duchess,
and Dave Dammit and I had a very special
[SPEAKER_02]: friendship and relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met at a 420 event in 2017,
the Cannabis Grand Cru.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as we met, we were instant
friends, exchanged numbers, were in
[SPEAKER_02]: contact immediately, hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so funny because he tried to
date me and I was like, no, we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it wasn't necessarily appropriate,
but he was like, you know what,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're a fucking round lady and I have to
have you in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that started a seven year fucking
fantastic friendship between Dave Dammit
[SPEAKER_02]: and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a unique friendship because he,
jokingly, I would say he was my canna
[SPEAKER_02]: daddy because he was like a father and a
mentor and a best friend for me in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He supported everything that I had created
and he had my back on all of my wild ideas
[SPEAKER_02]: and he listened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of my ideas were absolutely
fucking bonkers, but they were legitimate
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were real and they were creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he absolutely adored it and supported
me completely and followed it through all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to my pitch of my comic book to
different magazines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I joke that he's my canna daddy,
but really he was more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was my best friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was someone who I confided in and grew
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our love for cannabis blossomed this
most amazing friendship between us with
[SPEAKER_02]: our love of animals and plants and just
exchanging information and being good
[SPEAKER_02]: humans and enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of different things that
we inspired within each other and that we
[SPEAKER_02]: healed within each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know he did that for a lot of
different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave was so intelligent and so kind and so
humble and he had such a loud and booming
[SPEAKER_02]: voice, but he also would be so quiet and
direct with his words.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a very, very special man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so knowledgeable and he was
absolutely humble, kind and generous and
[SPEAKER_02]: hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had so much fun together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would always just go eat delicious
food, smoke a joint and laugh our asses
[SPEAKER_02]: off, listening to awesome music and
rocking out and dancing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would just have the biggest,
fattest smiles on our faces because we
[SPEAKER_02]: were just enjoying life together,
smiling and just having a ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would crack up all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would dress up silly and we would just
literally enjoy embasking each other's
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we magnetized each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to every event together and we had
silly little competitions between us with
[SPEAKER_02]: our hair and we would flip and dance and
we'd roll joints together and compete on
[SPEAKER_02]: who rolled the best joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave taught me a lot of different things
and I'm so thankful and grateful we got to
[SPEAKER_02]: be friends for that long and enjoy so many
facets of each other and just really live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I absolutely loved watching him at
HempFest and being in his groove and in
[SPEAKER_02]: his space.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: He supported everybody and he was the most
generous being ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, literally every time we would hang
out and you would see someone on the side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the road, he would always give them
money and always support them and always
[SPEAKER_02]: smile and give them something positive and
say something absolutely kind and lovely
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's the type of person Dave
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave loved everybody and he just wanted
everyone to be absolutely fucking happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was a fucking gem in the cannabis
industry and we lost one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing breeders, geneticists,
pioneers and human.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was literally a force to be reckoned
with and he highlighted and supported and
[SPEAKER_02]: magnetized and loved everyone around him.
[SPEAKER_02]: People literally could feel the Dave
Dammit vibration when he came into a room
[SPEAKER_02]: and you could see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see that long, curly ass,
beautiful fucking hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: That man had the most beautiful damn hair
you would ever see in your fricking life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen more women jealous of a
man than when Dave Dammit would walk in
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was adored by women.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had like 12 HempFest wives that he got
co-married to because absolutely everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: thought he was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just love and adore Dave Dammit and
we will forever, ever miss him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will always smoke to him on 420 and
we will never be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is an international holiday and we
absolutely celebrate and love you dearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you my dear, dear best friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not goodbye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's goodbye for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will see you again in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you so much to the moon and back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the second interview of the
James Robb podcast with my good friend,
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave Mesford.
[SPEAKER_08]: AKA Dave Dammit.
[SPEAKER_08]: AKA Dave Dammit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dammit Dave.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dammit James.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about the first time you
started growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I must have been about 13 or 14.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The kid used to, I was born and raised
Catholic hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom was like the church lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: She went to all the things and did all the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were kind of isolated here in
Linwood and this very dead end you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at right now is actually where I
was raised.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a bunch of apartments finally went in
over the bushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a forest over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids started coming up and down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd hop the fence and they'd go up to
the public school, which was just up the
[SPEAKER_04]: street.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally made friends with one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This kid was walking to school every
morning with his can, Coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turns out it was beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hit these guys and that was my first
experience smoking weed was with Bones,
[SPEAKER_04]: old Bruce and Brian, a couple of twins.
[SPEAKER_04]: I became my first public school friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You smoked it out of the can?
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoked it out of the can.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those of you that don't know,
a lot of us had their, my first experience
[SPEAKER_08]: was out of a can as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, I soon transitioned into a
bong after that, you know, we had the
[SPEAKER_08]: plastic graphics bongs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was a kid.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you started smoking out of a can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started smoking out of a can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decided we were going to grow some weed,
put this little fluorescent light in my
[SPEAKER_04]: closet and oh my God, if my mom ever found
it, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know the first thing about
growing weed, put it in dirt, keep it in
[SPEAKER_04]: some water, you know, keep it moist and
grew great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't figure out how to get flowers on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't even know there was such a thing as
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the commercial stuff we were getting
was just that commercial home being
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, but yeah, we didn't get much
flower in our bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I didn't, didn't really learn about
growing flower for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we smoked dried up leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't get us very high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just grow for very long because of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have origin stories though.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually hanging out with the older
brothers of Bruce and Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: We met some older dudes and they were the
weed dealers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We learned a little bit from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But where it came from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of the weed up here was brick
weed that had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There wasn't a lot of homegrown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe in the eighties, they're
starting to get more.
[SPEAKER_04]: The eighties was when we had the,
the homegrown bag appeal hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Affie tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Affie tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Affie tie, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sure missed that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't, it was so interesting how
sticky it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've yet to see in modern day
cannabis, the same qualities were it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally I could throw it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would stick on you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pick it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it wasn't just wet weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could stick it to glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can throw that on anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got, it's going to be a bitch to wash
that piece of glass off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went through that transition here
and that was my, I learned how to roll
[SPEAKER_04]: weed with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn how to roll joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a pain in the butt that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chopping it up a little bits with
scissors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying not to get it clunky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was it back to growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took another couple of years for me to
actually try to get serious about creating
[SPEAKER_04]: buzz and flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we saw the Appie tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, since Samilia, when we were
learning about since Samilia too,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, yeah, when you get some seeds
from that stuff, they're eating those
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since Samilia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Found some decent weed to grow,
some decent seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian weed wasn't bad, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Oaxacan and all of the stuff that DJ
Short loves to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grew some good weed out of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They finally learned about the light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Miracle grow together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what we did for
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We dug into my mom's miracle grow under
the kitchen sink that she used in all of
[SPEAKER_04]: her house plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: NPK, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: NPK is some of the most rebranded,
repackaged, hiked fucking a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: entities on the planet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basic.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something we said for basic too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people want to get so
complicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: On some level, you can go really basic and
get really good results.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we get older, we want to refine stuff
and we want to make it our own.
[SPEAKER_08]: But on some level, there is the beauty of
simplicity.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember amazing stuff and maybe our
palates were different or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there was a lot of stuff that less is
more in certain instances, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started using this guy's nudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always wanted to grow organic,
but that really takes outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough to grow organic unless you're
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with modern technology, technology to
grow organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot easier now.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people that provide
starting soil at the very least.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's organic soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can argue that ProMix is organic or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly they add some, not vermiculite,
but the other light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perlite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perlite, rather, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was always my base.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started to make a super soils and
adding all of our own inputs and the tarp
[SPEAKER_04]: method, shake up a corner, go around it
and mix the heck out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after a point, I met a guy who was
making his own nutrients up in Blaine up
[SPEAKER_04]: near the Canadian border.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dominion Organics, if anybody remembers
the brand.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blaine passed away, didn't have any plans
with family or friends to carry on the
[SPEAKER_04]: business, but he built some of the finest
organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never grown any better weed than with his.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, he died.
[SPEAKER_04]: The recipes, who knows where they are,
who might have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Family isn't interested in any upkeep of
the company or the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to be happening a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_08]: That happens a lot with the younger
generation not wanting to follow suit with
[SPEAKER_08]: the parents.
[SPEAKER_08]: For thousands of years, the son or the
daughter did with the father did,
[SPEAKER_08]: typically it was from father to son,
father to son and businesses got dressed
[SPEAKER_08]: on and names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally names followed the father
and the son and their business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that didn't happen here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I quit growing there for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got sick, had some health issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a minute growing, just all the work of
growing was overwhelming to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to quit and so I quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I quit for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: During that time, this is when Blair died.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting back into growing, I had a couple
of half buckets of this, half buckets of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grew out my first batch and they'd be real
happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second batch, I ran out of newts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally found out why I couldn't get
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither was their maker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm shopping around for organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alaska fish fertilizer came up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, man, that's organic as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found out they also had a bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the low end and the high end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, this is perfect, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheap, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started growing with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: My plants were growing and getting huge
and turning brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cardboard brown all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is going on with my weed,
man?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing that really took me most of
this whole batch to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh, no brainer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check my pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: During this time, this six or eight or
almost 10 years time that I grew with
[SPEAKER_04]: Blair's nutrients, the Dominion Organics,
I ended up hanging up my pH meter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never needed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, why do you guys even use a pH?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's all like, go check your pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check your pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine was always great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six, six, five, six, seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really pHed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never bothered to.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a couple of years of going through
that break in a pH meter, hell,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were 500 bucks or something back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: They still probably are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can get the $30 pH meter and you
can get the $500 pH.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to spend more than five.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you sure can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's the middle of the roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally decided I should probably check
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are my plants dying?
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked the pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that explains a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It explained a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been growing weed all my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a master grower, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are valuable lessons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I happen to find a nutrient mix that went
well with the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always 7.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got myself a pen and some up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just still didn't like the Alaska
fish fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using it hesitantly because it's
organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously with a pH meter and having
results like I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turps and the flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of yet to be seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that Blue 13, that was
Alaska fish fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's got some decent turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has great turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has really good turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really complex.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the one thing I like.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like complexity with my flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's just straight blueberry,
I might like it in the beginning for a
[SPEAKER_08]: day.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I get over it real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite things have a lot of
complexity to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, our usual Fred Allison.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, she's come by until it's gone,
quarter pound at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her first little stash.
[SPEAKER_04]: She just blew through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't smoke anything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you find something that you get along
with like that, where you like the taste,
[SPEAKER_08]: you like the effect, and it's available.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing is, it's a fresh product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So availability, it might be available
once every three months.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're lucky, it's available more than
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But typically, back in the day,
good stuff was available once every three
[SPEAKER_08]: months.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have a little window of a month.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had droughts too, where you
couldn't get stuff for extended amounts of
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was also a time, coming into a time
where medical laws were enacted in
[SPEAKER_04]: California and then Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the Wild West for quite some
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, availability was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's take a step back into the 80s,
because I feel like not a lot of people
[SPEAKER_08]: that watch the show, unless they were
there, not a lot of people know about the
[SPEAKER_08]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_08]: 80s was before my time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started smoking in 91.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would like to hear about the scene
and the energy in the 80s, because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: when it was really illegal across the
board.
[SPEAKER_08]: Federally, on a state level, everything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of scary, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, cocaine was right there in the 80s
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, if you were balling,
you had the good weed and the cocaine and
[SPEAKER_04]: all of that crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: But weed was interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did go through droughts in those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, I remember my wife was pregnant with
my first child, my son.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were just sick of not having any
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going downtown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to go fucking downtown and
buy some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little hippie wannabe biker all my
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out there causing trouble, hitchhiking up
and down the roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanging out downtown, places I didn't
belong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hopped in the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new, big four wheel drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's pregnant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm balling, union carpenter, doing pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember we backed in against the
back of this building and in front of us
[SPEAKER_04]: was a jack in the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just hang out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be back in about 15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come back with some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough I did, found a dude on the
corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: He paid him 15 bucks for a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice fat gram, but still 15 bucks for a
gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at what it cost today for that
$15 gram, it's like a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially given the circumstances,
the legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there were $5 grams and there was $15
grams and it was all over the place back
[SPEAKER_08]: then too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was also a lot more illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Given the legal climate, I had to pay 20
bucks for that gram or more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm in my pocket, I'm like cool,
looking around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just a guy going back to the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get in and I said something like,
yeah, I told you so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Putting on the seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were getting the bowl out, about to
smoke a bowl out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Said, well, yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some too.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean you got some too?
[SPEAKER_04]: She's pregnant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just going to stay in the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put right on and I've got the weed between
my legs on the seat and the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prototype, remember the prototype?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about it on my show before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the prototype.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I busted it up kind of in the bag and
got a load of bowl and I looked up and I
[SPEAKER_04]: said, oh, this guy's, the dude pulled out
of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: He pulled the parking space really weird
and at an odd angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he backed in, backed out and stopped
like right in front of me, making it
[SPEAKER_04]: possible for me to drive out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I felt it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I felt it right then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what the fuck is this guy
doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, man, we're leaving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I saw the guy coming from over
yonder who was talking into a brown paper
[SPEAKER_04]: bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I knew it was over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking all over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dropped the weed on the floor,
tried my best to kick it under the seat
[SPEAKER_04]: with the pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came, a couple dudes on each side.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grabbed her, didn't want to even talk
to me because they sold her the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a sting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put her in the back of his van.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they sold weed, their actual weed to
her and then busted her for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Busted her for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: While she's pregnant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the fucking 80s in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: That could have ever happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to follow them in the van.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally get a phone call on my old Nextel
flip phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had taken her to this underground
garage in one of the precincts and where
[SPEAKER_04]: they were processing people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was, the stuff that she was
hearing was just like, yeah, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was worth a lot more money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a bunch of Mexican dudes all
handcuffed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was just in a garage pregnant as fuck
on a bench with some dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was telling me there was like the
vehicles they had down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot rods, bad ass cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what was an expensive car in
the 80s, but they had it down there in
[SPEAKER_04]: their impound.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was all the shit they were doing
under the, um, Oh, what the hell was the
[SPEAKER_04]: name of that act?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a federal act that that went
around and was enabled in all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: municipal cities to do this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, yeah, that was the eighties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got busted selling a quarter pound to a
cop who was, um, my buddies and their,
[SPEAKER_04]: their biker lifestyle and the bar and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fight a fucking cop in a biker bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy had been up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's looking for weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my buddy's youngest brother,
he was like the high school kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were all the cool kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, just this little kid nerd,
but he was the dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was making bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always had weed for the old guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, he'd been out too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Told him, put Scotty, I could get some
weed from this dude that hangs out with
[SPEAKER_04]: your brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, no way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, yeah, put Kalal up to the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, my buddy is like, he was down in
the car doing lines of coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course he's no cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was part of the snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: County, the multi-county task force.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was a cop and they sure were
snorting coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we made a deal for the next day to
meet this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, uh, yeah, we had to cash found him
in the parking lot of the holiday and
[SPEAKER_04]: hopped into the truck with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he showed us the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, let me see the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scotty whipped out the money and here it
went deja vu.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy under in his trunk with the
fishing rods.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wasn't getting fishing rods out of his
trunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just standing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The car that was coming towards us with
all four of the doors opening as they're
[SPEAKER_04]: rolling through the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a total set of sting operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the dare movement?
[SPEAKER_04]: The dare program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big old fucking dare t-shirt I was
wearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the cops should not like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pushed my face in the fucking ground,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kicked the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just the middle man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that was, that was weed in the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that was one of the periods in my life
where I quit growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, man, I got pregnant.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife's, we're going to have a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just too scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not one of those dudes with big
balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeping everybody smoking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, on that notion, you got some big
balls later on in life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is the same yard where I came
over to your house and you were growing
[SPEAKER_08]: big ass plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like right behind where I'm sitting right
now, you had some plants in the same bed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so you did have some balls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot less to lose at that point too.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a lot less to risk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm, I still smile every time I
think about those plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: like in your front yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not talking about the backyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, everyone goes in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot of people grow in a suburban
area in their front yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are those pot plants in your front
yard, sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, yeah, that was, that wasn't,
that was a, that was a middle finger to
[SPEAKER_04]: any cop that drove down my dead end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Living at the bottom of a dead end.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they look over here as they're
turning around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was, well, that was the point where
it was going legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: You knew it was going legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, she basically just said,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a medical, I got a medical card.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, all of that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, night, let's talk about the
nineties a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you said California in 96,
uh, went medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that kind of changed the landscape for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, especially Washington followed suit
with medical or in followed suit several
[SPEAKER_08]: other states.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely been a West coast thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing about Washington coming up here
since the nineties, smoking weed up here
[SPEAKER_08]: since the nineties, uh, I always found
that it was more moist and I, for the
[SPEAKER_08]: longest time, I didn't understand it
fully, but there's so much more humidity
[SPEAKER_08]: up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You come up here, it's moist, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, so you leave it out of the jar for
just a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like, uh, it would be spongy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a lot of spongy butt up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that it was bad or anything like that,
but there was, it was spongy butt,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, it wasn't until I feel like the 2000s
in the mid 2000s, where people were using
[SPEAKER_08]: a controlled environments to dry and cure
their butt before they put it in jars.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're getting that, uh, what I would
call back then, California quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just have naturally good weather in
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it made it so much easier for that
drying and curing and the longer shelf
[SPEAKER_08]: life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was something, you know,
that was something that we eventually got
[SPEAKER_04]: into, um, you know, like I said,
uh, in the nineties medical happened and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, so did a lot of huge commercial grows
that took a lot of weed out of state,
[SPEAKER_04]: tons and tons, literally up here in the,
in the area, right here out of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing in barns.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people grew in barns.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where else is downtown in the middle of
downtown Seattle?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about, uh, air games.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was worried about my eight lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like when I went to eight lights,
it was a big deal back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was where I realized that there was
a, there were a couple of places to fit in
[SPEAKER_04]: this culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were the medical folks that I was
always down with and helped promote.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was still the top secret
guys, which had always been there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just making so much money,
so much bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, were fists.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the medical folks, I believed
everybody who said that cannabis helped
[SPEAKER_04]: their ails, helped their ills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I decided I would land.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way I could grow small amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't have to worry about getting,
you know, 10, 20 year sentences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and yes, there was the medical legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justifications, but those still were not,
not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I ended up, I ended up knowing
everybody on the planet that needed weed
[SPEAKER_04]: and had no money.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them had no money because they
couldn't work because they couldn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diverticular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, simple shit that probably
wouldn't kill them very soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: But God, if they had some weed,
they could function like you and me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an average normal guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that kind of, that hit me in the
heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the direction that I ended up
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I never made the tons of money
that a lot of dudes did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would say that the, the elder,
the, the lady that basically turned me on
[SPEAKER_08]: to the lifestyle, you know, having plants,
she, she gave out a lot, a lot of flour,
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was part of the, the AIDS movement
and she constantly was giving stuff out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you know, she was selling stuff too,
but I would say that she probably gave out
[SPEAKER_08]: as much as she sold.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and that's, that's how I met you
originally is through her and through Pat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's, it's the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like she was pushing organics
before anybody else.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard it from her organics grown,
grown with soil, you know, things like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, yeah, I feel like when you can
give back, I mean, I feel like cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: just by itself, you're making the world a
better place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can give it to people,
you know, obviously you can only give what
[SPEAKER_08]: you can give.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a, there's a line where we
can give back to a degree, but we can only
[SPEAKER_08]: give so much to where it's benefiting
other people and not hurting ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I subsidized my garden out of
pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, not like I'm going to pay my
rent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurry up and dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you're dealing with people that
actually need it, not even to cure,
[SPEAKER_08]: but maybe to help them to get through the
next day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people, that's all they need is
to get through one more day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's an amazing, beautiful thing
that brings so many of us together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that, it's that care community.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the true cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the foundation of it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it goes in other directions,
but the foundation and the origin of the
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization wasn't the financial side.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the people that didn't want to see
other people go into prison and the people
[SPEAKER_08]: that knew that it helped other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CIA, Compassion in Action,
so many groups that were literally founded
[SPEAKER_04]: on compassion and care.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, definitely proud to have been to
have even played the smallest part in
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people were involved and I can't
sit here and say, man, I gave out all my
[SPEAKER_04]: lead to sick bookers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people did that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people did that, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a clue on another notion though.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a, it's a collective effort of so
many people, so much effort and,
[SPEAKER_08]: and just making positive movements in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think that's how you make
change.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all starts with one action.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can start with you or anyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or anybody else, but it's a, it's a group
effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we're here now talking about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we couldn't talk about this in
public and probably even record this years
[SPEAKER_08]: ago in your front yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd be in big trouble by now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your neighbors might call the cops on us,
you know, 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guy looks like he's got a pot leaf on or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's three of them and they're in
the yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they got cameras.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just gives my heart joy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it keeps giving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps on giving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can barely give my weed away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause everybody's already buying that
store.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know some dude still grows it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some folks obviously that do,
but just to think about it and to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to own that, that karma,
that good sense of good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, karma is always this mysterious
thing that you never really.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, karma is real whether you believe it
or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I've been saying my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like karma is there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Karma is real.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter whether you believe in
it, but to be able to feel it and as an
[SPEAKER_04]: affirmation that it really is a thing and
that is there for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the ones that have done me wrong,
karma is there whether you believe it or
[SPEAKER_08]: not, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we live in a beautiful world and
there's beauty in the world, even with
[SPEAKER_08]: the, you know, there's sadness,
tragedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: All these other things, but it is a
beautiful world that we live in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're really blessed to be part of
something so much greater in ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're blessed to be able to recognize
that, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that's, that's part of it
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Being able to be grateful and have
gratitude and living in gratitude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, you know, we don't choose the
cards we get dealt always, but we can
[SPEAKER_08]: choose how to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We play them, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are, we are blessed for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis has given back to you quite a bit
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, traveling with Cannicon,
being part of something so big that has a
[SPEAKER_08]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Cannicon is, is really actually cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very unique event.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more shows coming up in the next
few months.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got three more shows this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest, coolest event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always the Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Hash Bash, they've been there
a decade or so longer than us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kudos, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's no Hempfest this year,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: There is none.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no 420 in San Francisco this year
at Golden Gate Park.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big free event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that was done too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just heard about that last week or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're losing support,
financial support to be able to put these
[SPEAKER_08]: nonprofit events on.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, was, and always will be the largest
cannabis event on the planet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: 300,000 people in our busiest couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our 20th and 25th anniversaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: 300,000 people through small parks in the
downtown area of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puget Sound views, mountains, snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of the beautiful people in this
park.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will never be reproduced.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's nothing quite like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other events.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other great events.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's nothing quite like Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you've never experienced it,
it's something that if it still comes
[SPEAKER_08]: back, you need to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, especially there's a lot of
people that talk about right and wrong
[SPEAKER_08]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we got freedom fighters like
yourself, you know, that have helped put
[SPEAKER_08]: it on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, thousands of us though,
not just me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm such a small part in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but you guys are all cogs in the big
wheel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of cogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: COVID came 2019, 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big hit to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: 502 legalization came and the law is
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Commercial cannabis from advertising.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The advertising laws killed most of our
revenue that we would use to put on the
[SPEAKER_04]: event.
[SPEAKER_04]: The event cost almost a million bucks to
put on.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were talking rent and port-a-potty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's an event like any other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to have the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to have the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course the cities,
they would always throw some, they would
[SPEAKER_04]: always throw some something at us
sideways, but we'd managed to manage to
[SPEAKER_04]: very nimbly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch the throw and make the play for
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Activism isn't cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got to do what you believe in,
you know, do it.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the final part of that is that we
achieved our mission statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really, we didn't, you know,
we enabled 502 to pass here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We enabled legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea that 502 is any good or not is
still up for debate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say this for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get pulled over and your car
smells like weed, you, all you got to do
[SPEAKER_04]: is tell that officer, I'm sorry,
officer, but the smell of cannabis fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: or burnt is no longer a valid reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grounds for, you know, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grounds for a surge or a seizure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, you can go to the store and
you can buy an ounce of weed and drive
[SPEAKER_04]: home now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sold Rick Steves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Travel guru Rick Steves.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, that's an issue that,
that's a image that I shot for High Times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave Bean and Stock and Rick Steves
showing, and they asked for the prop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you're the photographer Dave?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, yeah, this is Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with High Times.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do the shoot for Rick
Steves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, is there any way you can provide
the prop?
[SPEAKER_04]: They couldn't even say it on the phone,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how deeply embedded this paranoia.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still is, still was, but we went and did
the shoot and I had some of that blueberry
[SPEAKER_04]: A's before I had crossed it with other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were big, nice, nice hunky nugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick Steves had them in the bowl at his
piano.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Rick Steves there.
[SPEAKER_04]: After the shoot, they both were like,
is the prop for sale?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sold Rick Steves his first legal
allowance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gifted it to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, that works under the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we did it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, back to the Hempfest,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We killed it because we were successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been the world cannabis
freedom march going on for decades and
[SPEAKER_04]: decades, but there were the, some of the
core parts of Hempfest were also core
[SPEAKER_04]: leaders in the localized cannabis freedom
march here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I marched with them that year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the last year I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Screamed at from obvious possible hippies
in their cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fuck out of the road, you stupid
hippie.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to go to work or,
you know, I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you fucking with us for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed's already legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kidding?
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go buy some.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to buy some weed right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all these legalized weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed's not legal yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the miniscule issues of
legalized weed, you know, is it really
[SPEAKER_04]: legal?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the arguments.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only do this with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're trying to regulate THC levels
and concentrates here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand that they're
proffing up the black markets every time
[SPEAKER_04]: they make a move with their policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only proffing up the black markets in
terms of availability, quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or again, more dollars, diverse selection.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, black market isn't just some fucking
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got some shit from the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the guys that are growing craft weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most craft.
[SPEAKER_04]: Production of cannabis in the state of
Washington is what sinks most businesses,
[SPEAKER_04]: sinks most production companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ain't easy to sell your shit for,
you know, 25 cents a gram after what you
[SPEAKER_04]: got to put into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it comes to the multi-state
operators with enough money to buy or
[SPEAKER_04]: price everybody out of the markets is what
we see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's what we see across the
country.
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington has some good brands though.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some people doing it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: House of cultivar, my good friends over
there and Kano Organics and there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: bunch of guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think that those are just a
handful of them that I'm friends with,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the guys I'm friends with,
I feel like they do some of the best work
[SPEAKER_08]: in the state for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all subjective, but that kind of
leads into my next question is how do you
[SPEAKER_08]: feel about legalization?
[SPEAKER_08]: What did they do right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did they do wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not integrating vertically, I think is the
biggest mistake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not allowing vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I would say none.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can't own your own dispensary if
you grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge hit to growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge hit to dispensary operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: The market is not a true market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's propped up here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You let a market go, it will correct
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Markets just do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours isn't self-corrected because it's got
so much policy structure over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not a true market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it we didn't see.
[SPEAKER_04]: The DUI provision was another huge one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five nanograms in your blood.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a subjective number too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a subjective number.
[SPEAKER_08]: The state, you've probably got like 10X
that I'm at right now in your system.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state's toxicology lab, lead
professor, CEO, whatever you call him,
[SPEAKER_04]: he was totally against it and he showed
why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he showed how the comparisons work
between alcohol or cannabis and amounts,
[SPEAKER_04]: levels in your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just is nonsensical.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it puts people at risk who just took a
hit yesterday or it was Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got off work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They smoked the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they hadn't been high since Friday,
but they damn sure got five nanograms in
[SPEAKER_04]: their blood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they've got a DUI.
[SPEAKER_04]: The DUI is a really life-destroying little
piece of law infraction, if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just no good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some people, because of their
background, it might cost them a whole lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of time away from their families or off
work, going through some kind of treatment
[SPEAKER_04]: program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have a job and it's not your
record.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a cool thing at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as what do they do right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they did something right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They passed it to where I think they went
in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go right now and buy some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just go to a store and buy some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to like, hope I know the guy
or does he remember me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my guy is out, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully he still is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember me?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So convenience, definitely for
convenience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Testing is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole nother debacle, whether
testing is done properly, accurately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should this have been tested?
[SPEAKER_04]: How should it be tested?
[SPEAKER_04]: What should it be tested for?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for testing because we're
ingesting this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We test the quality of beef, with
chickens, we test most of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: we ingest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think the levels at which we
test are higher than any other
[SPEAKER_08]: agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't compared, but I accept that
assertion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine that's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of this stuff may be a little bit
extreme, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_08]: if we're doing it, we can do that,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a whole nother philosophical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle in the world of cannabis,
between the powers that be and the actual
[SPEAKER_04]: powers that are, meaning the growers,
the producers, processors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we don't wield as big a
stick as the municipal folks and the
[SPEAKER_04]: legislative folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you like to see in the future
for legalization?
[SPEAKER_08]: Homegrown has to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took away homegrown in the state of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also one of the biggest
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took away medical, and they took away
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't take away medical,
per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do need to register with the state
and have a medical card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you can... They sell
medical dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not strictly.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do have dispensaries that cater
to medical patients, that give them a
[SPEAKER_04]: price break.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have to pay tax, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still have to pay excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's on just about anything you buy
here in the state of Washington,
[SPEAKER_04]: anyways.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But through the Cannabis Alliance,
there's another group that I'll shout out,
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Alliance, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've just achieved a great victory in
the Senate and through the legislature,
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say, that does away with excise
tax on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in July, it starts sometime in July,
if you're a medical cannabis patient,
[SPEAKER_04]: with a card, of course, you can go buy
your weed completely tax free.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it also will lead into medical
providers, HMOs and all those guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay for cannabis prescriptions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, I have a prescription from my
doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows me to grow a few plants,
and then I have the extra plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right in that she does.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should give you some free
electricity, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't thought of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some solar panels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So give you some solar panels for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to go green?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go double green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The future is bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're also dealing with a bureaucracy
that is our government.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the future is slow and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cumbersome and falling all over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still pretty bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bright pile of shit rolling on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: But better than a dark pile of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than a dark one.
Amen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slowly but surely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys like you that are driving this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a team effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: I say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, we're all just in it together to
be successful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's people that are passionate
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's people that are driven by the
wrong things.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are people driven by the right
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are people that have passion for the
sacred plant like I talk about a lot,
[SPEAKER_08]: like yourself, like me.
[SPEAKER_08]: The saying is it takes a village.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the truth is it takes the world,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's slowly changing people's mind about
the stigma of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you beat a stigma?
[SPEAKER_04]: Education.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes down to education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I was going when I was
thanking you for doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're putting this out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how much you can monetize a
podcast unless you're some big rock star.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was never about money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this podcast is never about money or
accolades, awards, any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the awards.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the awards.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this podcast is about the oral history
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I have so many friends in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Being able to share their stories makes me
feel great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking about legacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your legacy, you have kids, you have
grandkids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two grandkids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two grandkids.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel about legacy and what is
your legacy?
[SPEAKER_04]: My dad was a merchant, the union rep for
the Seafarers International Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sailed deep sea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting in trouble as a young boy,
young man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got shipped off like a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids probably did.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something I was not into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I got married and had a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely didn't want to be gone all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this wasn't something for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Went into construction, union carpenter
for decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something for my son,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not into growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not into growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He works construction and pseudo.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm afraid that my immediate family
doesn't have the desire to carry on my
[SPEAKER_04]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that kind of leaves me in a lurch.
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some great genetics, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting in little bottles and jars in my
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting old, going bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: You name it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Run the gamut just like any other guy that
breathes, probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying the value of seeds is in
their use and not in their possession.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's so many people that collect
seeds and it's like, man, that's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's sad on a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sad that you're not using those seeds
and finding out what's in there because
[SPEAKER_08]: there's magic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We see eye to eye on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is magic in seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's stuff that's still waiting to be
discovered.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's tons of stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are they, though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are they?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in Dave's refrigerator in his
laundry room by his garage.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an issue for me right now,
given my health issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and your legacy is so much more than
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like we were talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: About the 2013 or 14 with Snoop Lyon in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were at that cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were at that cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: You brought your daughter for her 21st
birthday to see Snoop Lyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to smoke with Snoop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Snoop Lyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was Snoop Lyon because they didn't
pay him enough because they couldn't
[SPEAKER_08]: afford to pay him a lot of money,
but he still went on and DJ'd instead of
[SPEAKER_08]: rapping.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a magical cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a magical experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have been able to share those
experiences with your daughter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And her past on experience is that she can
pass on to Jasper.
[SPEAKER_08]: To Jasper, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, stories like that where she
got to experience it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was telling me earlier about the
story on the lot when she was at the event
[SPEAKER_08]: and they have all the free samples that
they give out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's not the only one that it's
happened to, but they have samples and
[SPEAKER_08]: there's like all these cool edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're into edibles, that was the
place to be because there would be cotton
[SPEAKER_08]: candy and there would be ice cream and
there would be some honey sticks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Savory stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crackers that had infusions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was just 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_08]: And back then, they weren't really
concerned with high milligram doses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now in California, it's like 10 milligrams
per dose, 100 milligrams per package.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back then, I mean, in the 90s,
we never even thought about a milligram.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, how strong can we make it to
where it still tastes good?
[SPEAKER_08]: But exciting times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back then, it was the new horizon and
everything was new.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you're younger, it's kind of like
that anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: But all this stuff is new and exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And smoking out of a can for the first
time, or even after you've done it a
[SPEAKER_08]: while, it's like, when else can you smoke
out?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they talk about cannabis being the
gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like we hear that a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think alcohol is the gateway drug in my
own opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey man, hey man, truly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I mean, truly alcohol is the
gateway drug and cannabis is the kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: opposite in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the gateway to enlightenment,
to sobriety, if you're having issues with
[SPEAKER_04]: other drugs, definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a self-reflection drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you smoke, if you get high,
cannabis will help you self-reflect and
[SPEAKER_08]: see the world as it truly is.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may not want to see yourself that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the people that don't smoke,
they feel uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it really shows you who you truly
are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Psychedelics do that too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they really show you the truth,
whether you want to see it or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a peaceful thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, very much so, very much so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, there are a lot different
strengths of psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you said that, I almost, you know,
this really isn't a psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty tough blow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, in that respect,
yeah, I have to agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It changes perception.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perspective and perception.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get really high.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to think things that you
wouldn't normally think.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you might get real hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I might get real hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to, the thing is that
you're going to think so much of things
[SPEAKER_04]: you might not ordinarily think of,
but you're going to open your mind to
[SPEAKER_04]: allow them if they come by.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and you might not see these things
in the same way you would see them if you
[SPEAKER_08]: were sober.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like smoking allows you to see
things from a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like if we were all smoking,
it would change our perception and
[SPEAKER_08]: perspective on the way we see things.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see good and bad and, you know,
I feel like you see the world as it really
[SPEAKER_08]: is sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Psychedelics even more so.
[SPEAKER_08]: You dive into some psychedelics and then
you start lifting off these filters.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can be gone for a while, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because what happens is I feel like
we get real jaded from the experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: From the experiences of life, from the
time we're born, we have these experiences
[SPEAKER_08]: and every experience puts a filter over
your eyes, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Over your mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so sometimes it's great to lift those
filters off and see the world as it truly
[SPEAKER_08]: is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we all live in these bubbles.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all see the world from our bubble
because of the experiences that have been,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, there's some genetic involvement
and psychological stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we inherit some stuff potentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: But lifting those filters off and
mushrooms, you know, all psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_08]: mushrooms, LSD, ayahuasca, DMT forms and
peyote.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel, you know, we were talking about
mushrooms yesterday and how they're kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of not really the most fun high.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stomach high, I hate getting the
stomach high.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not a very social high for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just depends on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might have been my brother I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for me, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that it's depending on the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: But my good friend, Mr. Marlon Asher,
we have eaten our fair share of mushrooms
[SPEAKER_08]: together and if it's too much,
I'm very antisocial.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with the right dose and especially the
right kind of mushrooms, I can't quit
[SPEAKER_08]: laughing and I have the greatest time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this guy is someone who goes out and
performs and sings reggae in front of
[SPEAKER_08]: thousands and thousands of people high on
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a public speaking thing for me
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I'll do public speaking and I'll
eat a microdose before because I feel like
[SPEAKER_08]: my memory recall is better and I'm able to
respond.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like caffeine with memory recall for
me with the microdose.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm able to do a lot of public speaking
and you just have to get, once you're past
[SPEAKER_08]: that fear, it allows you to open up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to do it on my show,
but I've done it on my show.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've done it at MJ Biz when I spoke at
MJ Biz before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But heavy doses of psychedelics are
definitely for reflection.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, going inside and seeing the
world as it truly is or it's a great way
[SPEAKER_08]: to reflect on who you are and getting rid
of your ego and looking at it from the
[SPEAKER_08]: outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because ego is just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all have to deal with ego.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an integral part of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, without an ego, that's a whole
different consideration.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we all kill your ego, that's always
been a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where would we all be if nobody had an
ego?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd all be one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that not like homogenizing every single
cannabis genome out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder how that homogenization of
humanity works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think, you know, we were talking
about cannabinoids and cancer yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: We touched on that and people selling RSA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So under the guise that it'll cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some cannabinoids are good and have
been proven to help and be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_08]: And other cannabinoids can exacerbate
certain conditions, certain types of
[SPEAKER_08]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But some people are using the RSA as like
a blanket statement that my product cures
[SPEAKER_08]: cancer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just floating the idea out there that
it's a panacea of some court.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is no panacea.
[SPEAKER_04]: There really is none.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a little bit of science thrown in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah, cannabis can do a lot of
things, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And possibly maybe it will cure cancer or
at least be one of the prime sources of
[SPEAKER_04]: that effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And RSO to a degree, there's many types of
RSO too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all RSO is created equally.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of my hardcore cannabis aficionados
out there, every time I say RSO,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just shooting themselves in the
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Evidently Rick is on the, well,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a clean product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: FECCO now or PICO, oil extract,
cannabis oil is the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that in my circles,
if I don't call it that, I'm beat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's for all you PICO FECCOers out
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and it has the potential to do great
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't always do great things,
but it's so subjective to the individual
[SPEAKER_08]: and our individual body chemistries.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you so much for coming on the
show and for giving me the time to
[SPEAKER_04]: interview you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again, you talked about legacy,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is part of my legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some ideas out there that I hear
you pick up on from yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that makes me proud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that I'm also contributing to the
greater cannabis database in the sky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're building it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're building it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're building it one story at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, if we don't record it,
the stories are gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Experiences still happen, but the story is
gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a generation that is aging out and
you got to get their stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still here to tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're great stories.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, your stories are great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like the collected effort because
there's so many people involved with it
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're not going to get all the
stories, but I'm going to get as many as I
[SPEAKER_08]: can.
[SPEAKER_08]: As many as you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already lost a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, people had asked on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thanks again and keep up the good
fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to keep up the good fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you too, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys for watching the episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got perspective on an individual that was
so important to our industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: The GoFundMe information is in the
description of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys can donate, please do so.
[SPEAKER_08]: It means a lot to everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't stress the fact of how important
he was for our community.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canna Con is an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_08]: HempFest was an amazing event and his
photography will live on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the photo on the back of my book
will be there forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is by far the greatest photo of a
male plant of cannabis that I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_08]: to this point in my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave, we love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your family.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank you guys for tuning in again
and have a wonderful afternoon.

See you next time.
