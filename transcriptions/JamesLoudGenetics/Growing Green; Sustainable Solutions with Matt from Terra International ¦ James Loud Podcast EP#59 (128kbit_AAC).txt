[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today our special guest is Matt from
Terra International.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, James, for having me
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're a terrorist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a little terrorist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are here moving a lot of
products and helping out this industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to bring a community back to where
it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about this for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met not so long ago, but I knew about
your product for the last year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good flour that I've seen coming from your
nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought you were running it about
for two years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just under the impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the last six weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the SF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've been running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known about it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: SF Kana, my good buddies over there,
they've been running it and crushing with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I was I was excited to test it
out and see how it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running it right now in our veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like you in this industry is what
we need, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, research, development and get
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this whole industry,
that's what we have to do is get better as
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think a lot of research and
development goes goes on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people really need to
do side by side testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's so huge to determine.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's good and what's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of stuff that maybe
works for a certain person and another
[SPEAKER_02]: individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else works for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, even cloning techniques,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it's a plant and it's so
dynamic, not every recipe works for every
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light recipes, you know, you know,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many variables involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I love is being on the
cusp of trying new things and cutting edge
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, cutting edge techniques,
cutting edge ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that stuff being on the on the on
the edge of what's new and what's
[SPEAKER_02]: upcoming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it's everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's an interesting time to be
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you learn something through all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like great thing that you
brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually joining a group of about five
or six guys that are coming together,
[SPEAKER_00]: which all different walks of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this industry, we have a grow two
growers involved in a genetics guy
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in a hydro store involved in it
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just trying to come together as
a unit and build a research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some that are double
stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some that are single
stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have double stack mother
room, double stack baby room, just to see
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different angles of this industry
and how far we can actually push this
[SPEAKER_00]: envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because realistically, we've only been
pushing the envelope about five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where we can actually come out
of the shadows and show our talents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I look at this industry,
we're only five, six years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal is to hit 10 pounds in a
couple of years per light, 10 pounds per
[SPEAKER_02]: four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do it, you know, because cost
per pound once corporate comes into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, full fledged in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our SOPs need to be about $200 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per four by four vertically, you can get
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's realistic, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or per four by four stacked three high.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm talking about single.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your thought on the double,
the two tier, the double stack?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause me personally, I think some of my
friends do really well with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer high ceilings with tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on your building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, environment is the most crucial
thing for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some places where it
allows a double stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually in talks with another
building on top of what we're already
[SPEAKER_00]: planning on moving into in the near future
is a triple stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one has 210 lights per room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 12 rooms in this facility as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the things that we're looking
forward to is to continue to evolve and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's honestly what the group,
the connected guys and Grow World and that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole little group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there like a year and a half ago to
the connect event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just seen all they're doing is
pushing education into this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow World Ag is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm glad to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're really great people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've connected me with really great
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's a nice community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with Sergio, what he was done
with the connect events.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just, it was his calling
and he's really owned it and taken it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he's doing them all over the world
at events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I love seeing my friends win
and it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had him on the show and him and I
have became friends over the last year and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's just a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's like he's on this
upward trajectory and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is good people want to surround themselves
and good things actually come out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first thing for me as well,
I seen Sergio and I was like, Oh my
[SPEAKER_00]: goodness, who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just continuing to listen to what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just told him, Hey, how can I help
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your business, I see your
philosophy, but there's other angles that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be able to come in and help and turn
on a couple of light switches for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to be probably a part of
the whole R&D facility because he brought
[SPEAKER_00]: this up and he said, Hey, are you guys
interested?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had talked to one of the growers
that's going to be a part of it two years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, listen, I need an R&D facility
because I'm coming out with our nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: line and I want to know everything about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still two years R&Ding our nutrient
line because nothing's going to be set in
[SPEAKER_00]: stone until the growers say that's what we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll still continue to make lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a line that we have
that comes out, which is a standard line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our expert line, we're going to
continue to evolve and innovate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a grower anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to let those days go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I'm about sourcing the right
people, the right products and putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: together as a unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Custom Ag, Formulators, and Fresno,
that's who blends it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have zero problem letting everybody
know that because you build a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a relationship with
people, they don't want to burn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of in dealing with Sergio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good ones don't, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn something even if someone does
burn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it doesn't take everything from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of the philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I learned from Sergio is trust
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to trust people, especially
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't pay their bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have trust issues with this industry as
well, especially with genetics and seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like giving people terms on
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets me very nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done it with some people and
gotten completely screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people out there that have screwed
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a certain level of trust with
certain people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially after a repeated business,
we are in an interesting industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's ever-changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still have trust issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's getting divided right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us are getting divided.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of us are getting together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I've been in this industry
a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always wanted to join forces with
other people and try to do a bigger and
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of talent left still.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of talent gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry has changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a lot of talent out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so within our circles, and I know some
of the people in your circles and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the people in my circle, we have a lot of
talent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just genetics or not just
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how big can you be by yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I'm preaching now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only sell to hydroponic stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have everyone's addresses to sell
direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe in people that have helped
me get to where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why am I going to go and go around
their backs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, if we used to go to your
hook guy, guess what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get those phone calls anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as growers believe that they're
selling more than the hydroponic stores or
[SPEAKER_00]: they buy more than a hydroponic store
does, that's correct in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now if you bring a group of a couple
hundred hydro stores together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you bring a group of a couple hundred
growers together, now you actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: leverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And numbers is power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you end up being able to
leverage things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers are out there and they
don't buy at hydro stores anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the education at the hydro store needs
to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's going to be it needs
to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dispensary, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but these things, they can be
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be, you know, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one of my things that I
was speaking with a couple of guys in the
[SPEAKER_00]: group is, hey, when we go into the hydro
stores, let's make reels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make every product that we're
displaying a real two minute reel and let
[SPEAKER_00]: the manufacturers express what they want
to express about their product,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it into the store, you know,
to where you don't have to rely on the
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like I'm going to end up
building a group of stores together and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them as a unit and say, hey,
log in to the connect events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, educate yourself, get better,
you know, because that's where we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toast a connect event at your location.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like the Sergio is going
all over with connect events, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love the SAC location, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen except the traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's there's some good food out
in SAC, too, surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I got my, you know, my buddies
out there and I love going to dinner with
[SPEAKER_02]: them, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the connect, he has food there,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you haven't gone to the connect
event, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's mingling with people that are
intelligent, that know the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are passionate on all levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's that part about is
great because I feel like there's this mix
[SPEAKER_02]: of vendors and people and it's very casual
and it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when I went to the event for the
second or third time, the first couple
[SPEAKER_00]: were still growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one that I met you at the Favin
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was three, four hundred people
there, you know, and it's like everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to come see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand Underlight was a huge topic
at the time and everybody wants to come
[SPEAKER_00]: see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still is, you know, and Favin's
killing it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, yeah, it's just everyone wants
to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the proof is in the pudding
with the Favin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like about it is like
there's actual I have friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends and I can see firsthand the
results that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what I like, because
everyone says they have something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's so many people out there
that are like, oh, I got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best of this or the best of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, the proof is in the
pudding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have the best flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like I like good flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you know, but everybody thinks
their flowers get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this ego and it's your product
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these hydro stores have to push their
egos aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like perfect example,
like you brought up Favin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Favin was from a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in a facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility didn't have it dialed in
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up going to a hydro store and the
hydro store had a couple more ideas that
[SPEAKER_00]: put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the communication that we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to a hydro store and transfer
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as growers, because most of us,
most of the growers ended up learning how
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow where normally at a hydro store,
you know, maybe your buddies here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but they, the origin came from
normally a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Free internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all from either your buddies or the
hydro store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times you had to talk about
it as like tomatoes, Berkeley indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go there and it was always
referenced to vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could make vegetable references,
but the second, they wouldn't talk to you
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to talk about wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's how serious they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of places were like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a hydro store down in Gilroy and I
think it was 2010 and we didn't talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very closed lip situation,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but now it's growing, you know,
we're allowed to express ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to show each other,
but now in this time, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're closing up some, some people are
closing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see a lot of these large
growers and they buy direct from every
[SPEAKER_00]: single manufacturer, which I understand
that philosophy is to cut your price down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can look bigger and understand
that you're never going to be bigger than
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should start to join a team to an
extent, you know, and that's what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep us alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of being a part of the race to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of this is that race,
especially if you're a cultivator,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I'm not, I'm not a
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do cultivate, but I'm not a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a genetics guy.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have cultivation partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have cultivation friends that do amazing
cultivation, but I, I'm blessed that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not doing cultivation because it's really
difficult, you know, and it's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: prices keep going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The inputs keep going up in cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same at the hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every store is challenging each other and
$2 cheaper, a dollar cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be an end of that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're trying to do is come out
with branded quality products that people
[SPEAKER_00]: know about and kind of set a precedence
of, Hey, I would rather fight my brother
[SPEAKER_00]: than my dad, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what's going on in our
industry behind the scenes is,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, your hydro store is your brother,
the neighbor, you know, it's okay to fight
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy some days, you know, but are you
going to beat them up to where you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: see no more?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when your dad comes in, he hits you
one time and you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad's still like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't fight my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't fight your dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, in the back of our
mind, you know, the manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_00]: they control everything in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is it their duty and their job to
also help the stores?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where I'm coming out of
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our United Products and Royal Gold
Sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We distribute for a lot of manufacturers
quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're trying to do is speak to
them and let them know that the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: are hurting right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydro stores are hurting right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only ones that aren't hurting as much
the manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's time to kind of depending on
the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the manufacturers that are still
doing well right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's margins that they're holding on
to, you know, and so like for our nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: line, I'm going to cut out all the
margins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give it to the stores to actually make
some money and still give it to the end
[SPEAKER_00]: user cheaper than what pretty much most
the salts out there on the market are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just it's my give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: My stores, every single store that
supported me through this whole journey
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've been on since 2014, 15,
you know, I can't leave them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's loyalty, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the things that I believe
full hearted in is actually supporting the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that support you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's talk about your nutrient
line for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's blended at custom mag
formulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to distribute for Athena and did
that ended that relationship about three
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just our views were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I tell all my stores is,
hey, it's time to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did with custom mag was I said,
hey, give me the highest input you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can for this three part baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sell it at the cheapest price
possible and see where it goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the guys that custom mag are
extremely brilliant at what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their craft, their manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have three groups working with
custom mag right now to do what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Research and develop other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue to take this to
another level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just have the three part right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no we have a full line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a full line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a PK powder in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have a pH up and then a finisher
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're actually for our
hydrochlorous acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with a couple of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One I'm not going to divulge, but another
one is clean grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has water max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where a lot of products
were generated from in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so with his and we can go make
it ourselves, you know, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in helping people that are in
the circle, you know, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another hydrochloric acid,
which isn't hydrochloric acid that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to come out and show a lot of people
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're happy to have that in our product
line as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of product on the market
and there's not a ton of quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's gotten better through
rec as far as in California, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because every state is so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, specifically flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can talk about extract
extracts, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we can talk about the end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, what would you say the biggest problem
with the flower out there is you think
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs, you think growing and carrying
back in the day, drying and carrying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was huge, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say now it's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown to instead of doing 20,
30 lights in a house, it's grown to a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand five hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to manage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size of rooms, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, probably lack of education for
that size, you know, just having growers
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you scale up to those levels,
there's going to be change, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so the evolution of technology is
helping us, you know, because back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day we used all hand water, you know,
like I heard on the podcast couple that
[SPEAKER_00]: you still have water outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do I.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just don't have marijuana
plants in my backyard anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like to go outside and that's my
peace and my calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but when people are in the garden,
you know, they're used to hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're using drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as things change, sensors now that we
have sensors, you know, those things are
[SPEAKER_02]: game changers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, you know, and that's what's
going to make us better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, is there a transition
period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there still some fire that five,
10 years ago we would have never seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I smoked some the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke too much anymore,
but I got a cut from or one of one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies got a cut from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That poison gusher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to bring gas back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the flora flames growing that as a can
is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I got it from the SF Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they just do a good job with
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was floored.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, man, I need to Uber home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did not create the poison gushers.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but yeah, it's part of the TC
library that my partner has access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's it's so you're in the
minority and I'm in the minority.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like not everybody is turned on to
poison gushers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not candy enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, same thing with the you know,
the what is the new one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have the new strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a new strawberry banana
skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not candy enough for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's got a lot of funk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's I like the poison gushers
for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got fuel and funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's special for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's it's also one of those
ones that still burns down to the roach
[SPEAKER_02]: and tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I opened the bag and I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't smell that too often,
you know, in this industry, like I was at
[SPEAKER_00]: the connected event with the candies and I
looked at all 20 jars, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had the VIP pass to go in the
back and I looked at them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to knock any of them,
you know, but some of them were missing a
[SPEAKER_02]: nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was knocking some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, and there's some stuff and
I feel like a lot of that some of it's
[SPEAKER_02]: drawing so it's too much heat in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's another problem is like not
getting your temps down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you have a little too much
heat, that's a that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more light than what we used
to have back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more light.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lights different that, you know,
we I didn't even like LEDs at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talk about on the show a lot,
but HPS, I'm still a HPS guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some HPS here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love R&D stuff under HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like doing my reversals under HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's nothing wrong with HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in our facility at our R&D
place, we'll have HPS as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to what we're going to
do is basically open it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want your product to be displayed
here, use the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you got to use HPS because you
love it because it costs more to run than
[SPEAKER_02]: LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but if you love turps and you love the
way the HPS makes the plant express,
[SPEAKER_02]: then there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers going to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have the turps and you
have the smell, that's what I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: missing a lot in this industry right now
is the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's missing the smell and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about how Instagram is to
blame for this because you get these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants on Instagram and it's just based on
luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, it's like
really like what does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it taste like?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: All those things you can't get from a
pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not getting the smell from
it, you're not going to get the taste from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes the smell is more like I
feel like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells good, but it smokes even better
than it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a handful of things out there
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I started smoking again because of the
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't smoked in about three or four
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just from our mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, OK, I guess I got to break it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with it is when that's the if
I have 20 or 30 or 40 different flavors
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm smoking on, I get to that and I
end up smoking all that before I go into
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I might have a bunch of stuff
that might get old because I smoke the
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like trying all kinds of different stuff
all the time and depending on the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that Skittles just sometimes when it's
a good batch, it's like it just tastes
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, when I see a good batch and I'm at
the right place at the right time,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's where I'm going to smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally it's in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know where I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's you know, it's a great place
for me to go hang out in a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to see some of the absolute top
notch weeds in this world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much good stuff besides
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Skittles has a special place in my
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many genetics that are good
and there's so many that are just average.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like there's so many that
need more work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Punch is one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one step away from being cool and
being good, but by itself is just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: eh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can cross it to stuff and you get
some interesting expressions and some
[SPEAKER_02]: really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreos is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people don't like Oreos, but you
cross it to stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like one or two steps away from
being amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and that's your lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I let you go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we need is people in our
industry to kind of stay a little more in
[SPEAKER_00]: their lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got we got builders selling products,
but they have no facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, genetic guys are going out there
selling Rockwell and their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what we want is to
build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the genetics man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the beauty of the white market.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the beauty of being able to do
stuff legally is now you can stay in your
[SPEAKER_02]: own lane and you can be successful at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be extremely successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you're at the top tier of
your industry or whatever you do,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's genetics or nutrients or you
name it Rockwell, you know, whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is, if you're at the top, you're going to
be successful and you can really hyper
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on improving genetics or improving.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the guys that try to do everything,
man, they end up losing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now, we're working on a 70 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't be saying this, but we're
working on a 70 30 compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's like, how can you compress
perlite?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go outside the box,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like what I did with
sunshine way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's go outside the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys gave us a bag of sunshine that
weighed one hundred and twenty pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to weigh 60, now it weighs 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can carry this upstairs anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I told them, let's change the
narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's make it a white bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to me at 60 pounds and see what we
do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up, you know, selling more
white sunshine than you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just changing the
narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand your lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay in that lane and focus and do the
absolute best you can do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you prefer Rockwell?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite substrate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocoa soil or it's just.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of those guys that likes all of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like everything for different uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe different uses cause for
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going outdoors, you should be in
some peat moss, you know, because you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold that water and retain the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're inside, it's whatever you feel
more comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, the reason why I want to
build a team is to educate people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think Rockwell is going to be
gone in two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a crazy subject for people to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if people can wrap their
heads around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think it might go away and
you have to kind of look at the writers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me, give it four.
[SPEAKER_00]: When federal legalization comes,
I believe it's going to be around four
[SPEAKER_00]: years from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's going to be a lot of
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think they're going to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more Rockwell because it's
environmentally unfriendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like with our led lights,
if you don't know your efficiency on your
[SPEAKER_00]: led light in a couple of years,
you're probably going to have to switch
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's why HPS will probably be
going away, unfortunately, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is not efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as efficient and it creates more
heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, it creates more electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I mean, I, I get that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockwell, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used in ag so, so much, so heavily
used everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a Disney Disney world and you go
through a little boat ride and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell in there and I was caught off
guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, but there's going to
be a time and a place where we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: elevate and get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I would say Rockwell is going
to get switched into Coco and do time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like Rockwell for, for certain
uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Rockwell for my mom's and I like
Rockwell for loans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always open to change, but yeah,
I mean, we're working with Grodan right
[SPEAKER_02]: now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting outlook on the industry
because stuff can disappear just like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you going to do if you're
buying all your stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say you're buying everything from
Grodan and Grodan goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're lost as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to go back to the
drawing board.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean there's going to be a learning
curve when you switch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or just in general, not to be
able to go to a hydro store or bounce
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas off people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's everyone going to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like in Oakland, we were all told we
were allowed to use generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use those anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the more you're around people that
are in this industry and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating, you're going to educate
yourself to go to another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being on the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about around right people that
actually care about furthering the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, when I went around the
connect community, that's what I seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen the next evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right where the where it's going to go,
because that for me as the owner of our
[SPEAKER_00]: company, I can't think about today,
even though the day to day task,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job's two years down the road,
you know, and if you can't see two years
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road, then you should just
probably not own a business, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know how to pivot at the
right times, then you'll end up falling
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two years for us has been the
most successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not too many people can say that in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being around the right people that
have the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, we plan for the future and
prepare for the worst for the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we still are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be creative and ready to pivot
at any moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we pivot with inside our realm,
just like you do, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people want to pivot from this thing
to this thing to this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they're going to be breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they're going to be stay in your
lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, stay in your lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the beauty of, you know,
the times that's, you know, and we are in
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is amazing to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the fact that cannabis is legal
to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not be fully legal, but we are
talking about it right here, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the path towards legalization,
like federal legalization, we're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you think that's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven or eight years from now,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think four.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think four?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think interstate commerce is going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think baby steps, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe four, maybe five.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think baby steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so much red tape with everything
that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be talking about de-scheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they didn't really reschedule it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's actually a pathway that we
have to go down before that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will happen for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to where we can put money in the
banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing with interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Germany just went wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's going to be huge for Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these dominoes have to start to
fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the United States, things take a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that we are going schedule
three, they're going to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that they can do research and
studies, and that opens up a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things I don't like about
the rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer de-scheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most of us would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say de-scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you have to
understand it's still about money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's about money.
[SPEAKER_02]: With politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Politics and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry makes a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Government's going to be in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your silent partner, Uncle Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay him.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one guy you can't mess around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, just like Amazon
Prime, you can research and develop
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a tax write-off, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the things that we're
here to help educate this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to further into a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just, hey, I go to the hydro store to
learn how to grow a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take your packs back to the hydro
store and ask them, can you help me get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those days are five, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydro stores, we've got to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to educate ourselves to the
commercial level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the mediocre weed that was so
easy to sell 10 years ago or 15 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's long gone, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really need to constantly be trying
to improve what you're doing, even if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to be in the back of your mind
that I need to make this product better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're making genetics,
whether you're growing flour, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making extract, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have that mindset that my
product is good, but it could be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's so huge across this
whole industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can really keep that mindset,
you're going to do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're going to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the guys that were like,
I'm just going to keep growing this
[SPEAKER_02]: mediocre flour until the wheels fell off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the wheels fell off a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to coach football with the
drill sergeant, and his motto was day by
[SPEAKER_00]: day, we get better and better until we
can't be beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wake up every single day and try to
get better, just like today, I was only 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes late coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than the first time,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, every day, gradual
improvement, just get better every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been getting up early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get up early.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your time you get up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Five thirty to, well, I try to get up at
five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been getting up at five thirty,
setting my alarm for five thirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been traveling a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still try to maintain that time,
even if I get a bed late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you on your P's and Q's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it tells you there's nights that
you go to bed late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be going to bed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your body tells you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You regret them the next day, but you
force yourself to regret those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you go out and you drink
too much, you know, the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no sleeping in anymore,
I wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those days are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get to sleep in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there'll be time in my life where
I do get to sleep in if I want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really enjoy waking up early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be in a regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you see these old guys that are
80, 90 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still wake up at the same time every
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get their papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a schedule, you actually
end up what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Living longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my father, he's one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't sleep a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's never slept a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's times in my life where I used to
sleep like four to five hours a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to drive a bus and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove a bus and a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the very beginning and like city bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to drive the VTA bus from three o
'clock in the morning till 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I jumped out and I started doing
soil deliveries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's how everybody knew
me, the guy in the truck, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, we've grown and I learned a
lot in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I learned that a team is what
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I can't go that far, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're building a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it feels it not only feels good to be
part of something so much bigger than
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, but it's essential moving
forward in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you know, because realistically,
one grower, they can change any laws at
[SPEAKER_00]: any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but now if we have two hundred,
three hundred, four hundred, five hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: growers doing this way and then they
change, it also affects the tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you group up as a big enough entity,
you have more leverage to where things
[SPEAKER_00]: don't change on you as fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's still about the
almighty dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I like focusing on quality at
the end of the day, but it's still you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't pay PG&E for six months,
you're not going to have your lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was a time where you
injuring covid and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you could go without paying your you
go six months, but they don't play around
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: PG &E and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've taken some big hits
because of problems of the internal
[SPEAKER_02]: problems at PG&E and problems with their
equipment and fires and campfire that my
[SPEAKER_00]: drill sergeant, we actually went up to the
campfire victims that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we took 20 of our kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We loaded up my truck at the time with
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a food drive and, you know,
it's all about helping people that need
[SPEAKER_00]: help in the Marines.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a Marine and then he jumped out of
the Marines and went to the army.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, he ended up being an army
ranger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, bad ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first day of practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I get parents cussing at us left and
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He believes in team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we would have one kid on a
gurney, four kids holding the gurney and
[SPEAKER_00]: go around the whole track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when that guy's done,
get off until we're all five of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't touch a football.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't we run, run and he goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these parents look mad at us and I'm
like they are and he goes, give him a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as nobody quits, give him a couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids walk in military fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go to Florida and a couple of
years coaching these kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single file lines, two lines everywhere we
walked, you know, and it all these kids
[SPEAKER_00]: hated us for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're all about 17, 18 years
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come back to me like Coach
Caputo, you know, and they come give me
[SPEAKER_00]: big hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool because they understand what
hard work is, you know, and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry is going to take to get to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard work between everyone as a team,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's funny because I feel like hard
work skips generations sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with technology, life has become easy
and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I tell my kids every single day,
I don't care what you do in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be the best at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strive for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video games, I got one son that thinks
he's a video game expert and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, then join one of those leagues,
you know, but he won't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's not the best at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might go back to school and get
better, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's one of the beauties
of today and being alive in this era is
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can kind of keep reinventing
yourself, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back 100 years ago, if you're a cobbler or
if you're a tailor or whatever your father
[SPEAKER_02]: did a lot of times that you had to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you can keep reinventing yourself
if if you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've done it a bunch of my life,
you know, reinventing myself, learning
[SPEAKER_02]: things that all kind of have tied together
to lead me to where I'm at now,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people jump from thing to thing and
but food and cannabis go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't get it right the first
time, you can have another career.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have another career and you can
keep trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're if you're a hard worker and you
don't enjoy it, move on and try something
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's no shame in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're learning new skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to hear the word no
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you first start business,
you hear the word no a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is you learn to accept
failure and realize that failure,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't end at failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to get back up and keep
trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sports are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Martial arts are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell my kids the cannabis industry is
definitely like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I tell my kids the word no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually get something out of the word
no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're told no as a kid, you can't go
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You start doing the dishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do whatever you can in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get that to turn to a yes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The word no isn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started my company,
everybody told me no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends were all golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those guys to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to become a distributor for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, call me back in six months,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set a date on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called him exactly six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, dude, you didn't bug me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't bother me for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you called me on the exact date.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, now, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give you 50 trucks at this
price, 50 trucks at this price,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 trucks at this price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll be a distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first year, we sold one hundred and
eighty eight trucks of Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we lost money doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned a lot from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we built a great
relationship with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got one of the best products on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the longest time, I thought Michael
was the owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally just met Chad in Vegas for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frickin amazing people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fun guys to be around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they love the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got their own podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick and Mike?
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The perfect story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three of us talking, you know,
you get us going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a I don't know how long we
filmed for, but it was it flew by like it
[SPEAKER_02]: was it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those guys, you know,
those guys like talking and they enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out in Vegas with those guys and had
a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, good people, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then we got Huckleberry
Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they're amazing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The White Thorn Rose is one of my
favorite, favorite flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's feel good, like feel the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to feel the best you've ever
felt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoked that stuff because it just keeps
making you feel better every time you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, give me a nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll smoke after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I guess there's this blue 13 for
my friend Dave and then the White Thorn
[SPEAKER_02]: Rose and they're just.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, for the genetic side, I stopped after
it went from to train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you like train wreck back when you
were smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, but then we grew too much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everything that I normally smoke is
pretty much strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke it and then eventually go
to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a teen, I would smoke
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we ended up starting with some
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was four hundred and eighty
dollars an ounce, though, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but that was that 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you start to learn and grow up
and find out that, hey, you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue to pay four hundred and eighty
dollars for an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to find a way not
to pay that to smoke every day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's just the side of the
hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's what our industry
does have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our industry has a ton of hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to refine it into a business,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, to do what you're passionate
about the end of the day, just do what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, what is success is success
being success is defined so so differently
[SPEAKER_02]: by each person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so subjective, you know, is money
success is being happy success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some point in the middle of those
things that was success is owning a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people want to collect this and
collect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like that when I was
younger a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But success to me is happiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like happiness to be able to do
what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through all three of those in my
lifetime so far, and I'm starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out to me success is when I pass
away my funeral will be full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an enormous amount of people at my
funeral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because that means it's not easy
to go to a funeral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally people have moved away or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you mean enough to somebody in
someone's life, they come to the funeral,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, unless you outlive all your
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's not such a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's, you know, and I've had a
couple friends die of cancer in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two days ago, my buddy just found out he
died of cancer and he's long battles with
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncle had stage four cancer that he
found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was about 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy does hardwood floors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Hey, we got two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pass away in two weeks or
you can come up with $164,000 and take
[SPEAKER_00]: these two shots and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took the shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's put those two in them and $164,000
for two shots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now he gets to watch his son be on
amateur on the PGA tour and he wished he'd
[SPEAKER_00]: probably died now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but you know, it costs a lot of money
to help his son right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine shouldn't be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's wrong personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a bunch of that going on all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, to me, that's greed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand people, you know,
I understand people have to develop drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: and they cost a lot of money to develop,
but that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: 164,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 82,000 shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of, I was kind of feeling like
that with this whole COVID thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't profit off people dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like all the people that made
the shots during COVID, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they told all of us, it was free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost us $40.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cost the government and it cost the
taxpayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: $20 to the government, $20 to the
taxpayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were talking about the
toilet paper hustlers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those ones piss me off, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys that would buy all the toilet
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be kidding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that happened in our industry and I
was probably at fault for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told everybody, Hey, COVID is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys better go out and get your
nutrients because it's going to run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had people going to the Bay
area, loading up on every single thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they possibly could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then driving up to Sacramento and
grabbing whatever else they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a heyday for the hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID was an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were in the industry of COVID and
you weren't successful, you should be out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably doing something wrong
because it was very easy to be successful
[SPEAKER_02]: during COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of people with money and
they didn't shut down the dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_02]: people were excited to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were excited to be growing,
drinking and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hardest thing was trying to find
products for the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they would switch anything at any
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're used to using grow Dan,
I don't care if it's coltoline,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was whatever was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take every single thing off
this shelf and put it in my grow room and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll figure it out later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sprung board into success through
COVID, which is now it's time for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: give back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the right time to give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, since COVID, it's been a
whirlwind for this whole industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been up, down, down, down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's starting to come up a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been hot spots and a lot of cold
spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been rough for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the problem is during COVID,
on the cultivation side, I saw a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people expanding, expanding, expanding,
thinking it was going to be like that for
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then they either had to get rid of
their second spot that they just built out
[SPEAKER_02]: or third spot or a hundred thousand square
feet never got fully built out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concept was good, but the market
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, going back to when
it's federally legal, that's when the boom
[SPEAKER_00]: will come again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking four years because
presidency, you know, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: president that is politics is in our
industry, you know, and to get somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: voted in, I think federal legalization is
going to be on the next ballot,
[SPEAKER_00]: not with the two that are going right now,
but on the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the next one after that, we will see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said seven to eight years,
seven to eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that we're not ready for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm ready for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been ready for it since 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think exportation at that time is
going to be legal as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exportate federal exportation to other
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine us missing out on all this
importation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Import export, you know, opportunity that
Canada gets to experience, potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico will get to experience before they
might get to experience it before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia gets to experience it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, Portugal, South Africa,
all these countries have import export.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or at least export.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, for us to miss out on this
opportunity is silly because dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the best flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the best growers, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can argue this with some people,
but I think we have the best growers and
[SPEAKER_02]: the best product in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be able to export it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, but think about the liability or
the viability of it is shipping,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, pounds from here to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also grow it in Europe too,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm thinking is it's going to be
more your business, genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the springboard is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, genetics can already be shared
through tissue culture internationally,
[SPEAKER_02]: phytosanitary export.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that stuff is already good to go,
especially on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, the genetic stuff is
already done, but I think you can go buy a
[SPEAKER_02]: Hershey bar in Europe that's from the
United States.
Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: McDonald's is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's way worse for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in all reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, if we're talking about
what's healthier and what's better for
[SPEAKER_02]: you, there's still people that believe
that cannabis is bad and causes lung
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, show me the money, show me the
proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was reading this article the other
day that psychosis in younger people,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they smoke too much or smoke,
and maybe that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning about it more, but I feel
like cannabis does more good than bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a plant, I think it helps people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that for so many conditions,
it can be an alternative to something that
[SPEAKER_02]: could potentially cause cancer or get you
sick or be a lot worse off for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or strung out on drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or strung out on drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, pain pills, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a substitute for pain pills,
I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's not for everybody for that,
but the ones that are, they deserve to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you force somebody to do
something, that's what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: when we come out with the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have good, better,
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you force someone to do something,
they're going to revert and do what they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody likes to be forced to do anything
in this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the new world, you know,
because it all came from our dad telling
[SPEAKER_00]: us this is what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom and dad, my way or the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to tell that to my mom all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom, this world is not your world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so much of this reality is
counterintuitive that you think it's one
[SPEAKER_02]: way, but it really is the complete
opposite once you have the full
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you want your kids to live an
easy life and not to suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people, and I'm not
generalizing with you, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want their kids to suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately they give their kids too
easy of a life and that causes suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it has the exact opposite
effect, but we're so often looking at a
[SPEAKER_02]: symptom rather than the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at this is like, this is the
problem, but no, that's just a symptom of
[SPEAKER_02]: a much bigger problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's happening all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of us just focus on what we can
see and not what took it to bring that
[SPEAKER_02]: issue to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coddling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's coddling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coddling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we want better for our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but at the same time that hard
work has paid off for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the sweat, the tears,
sleeping four hours, having a bus job as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as selling soil, you know,
those are the things that make you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to make you appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is, is like,
if you don't experience a hard life and to
[SPEAKER_02]: some degree, not in your whole life,
but if you don't experience the opposite,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't really appreciate the good life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, the sour and the
sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you don't ever experience
this, the sour, the sweet will never be as
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell everybody, this is my line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why we have bad days?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what a good day is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you always have good days, you don't
know what a bad day is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if something hits you out of
nowhere, that it's going to take you for a
[SPEAKER_00]: tumble, you know, Hey, we're all
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been punched, you know,
stand back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall down seven, get up eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole nine, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this industry is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business, being an owner in a business,
you're going to hear the word no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get used to it and learn how to take that
word no and pivot it into something you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Giselle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The roast of Tom Brady, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I liked jujitsu and it was so
funny how they roasted him on his,
[SPEAKER_02]: his wife leaving him for a jujitsu
instructor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it known a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, I thought it was
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to find out he made $25 million
from Netflix.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they paid him to do the roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's not a lot of guys that
wouldn't do the roast for 25 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why he's sitting there smiling,
thinking about that 25 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I would do it if I was him
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that guy got too much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Hart made, how much did Kevin Hart
make?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, Brady lost all that
money on Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm a Niners fan,
but I got a little respect for Brady as
[SPEAKER_02]: being the goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty impressive what he's
done as a quarterback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he's, he's quite the character.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to lose $40 million in
crypto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he lost a shit ton of money in crypto.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they, in fact, there was a couple
of jokes about it on the roast though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched most of the roast, but yeah,
I'm a Die Hard Michigan fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love Brady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The underdog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brady's from the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah High School, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep beating my son's high school
every year in football right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are stacked over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everyone wants to go there probably
because of Brady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you play football, you'd know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got like four varsity teams pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put together four teams.
Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bay area is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and in some place I move away
from and I ended up moving back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always gravitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a magnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides having good friends here,
there's just an amazing array of good food
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences to be had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Seattle too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to spend part of my time in
Seattle and anything with Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in Seattle or you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent a lot of time in Seattle with
my good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all you guys up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely spend part of the year
up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I wasn't focused on this right now,
so much what I'm doing with genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be up in Seattle for a third of
the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Seattle, especially during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lake Union's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food, the people, and I just have some
really amazing friends up there that I
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy spending time with that I could hang
out with more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived off Lake Washington Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only lived there for about six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandpa was the president of the union
for Boeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My father used to work for Boeing a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in Washington works at Boeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you hear up there is Boeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been there for I was,
man, 20 years now it's been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've been to Washington,
but yeah, it rains a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The music scene up there is nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food up there is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, every time I go, I have a great
time and it's just a, it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially in the summer, it's like
the perfect, it's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect in summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter, when it's raining kind of,
it can suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks if you're there the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're there, cause I lived up there
for six months and I hit most of the rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes a toll on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have things called happy
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a little light and you turn it
on because it rains so much up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high school I went to was all indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause out here, everything's
open.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the high school I went to is in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wide open, but it went up there is
everything was halls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of good salmon up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is fishing up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good weed now for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess they've had good weed for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I had family up there
and their, their weed was good,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was, it was few and far between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really, since they started really
dialing in where like you harvest it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you dry it and you cure it under the
correct conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you seal it under conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, house cultivar, those guys crush
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A can of organics, another brand,
those guys crush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireline, another brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, there's some really
good flour up there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out real quick that twamps in
California were different than twamps in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who wanted two grams for a twamp
in Washington down here was one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I went up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 16, bought a little quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, I'm gonna smoke a
little, get my money back, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, this was, the guy looked at me
like, this is short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, that's what we pay for
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, yeah, but it's cheaper up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh man, well, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up smoking the rest of that for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two grams for 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two grams for 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended up coming down California
later on and ended up making a holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two grams for 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the going thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, the weed was real wet up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more spongy than I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought genetics up from the Bay up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had sour diesel, chem dog,
Bubba Kush, Larry Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good local stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember some of the stuff up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The permafrost, Cenex was up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pretty popular one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Alaskan Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I saw that the first time,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I ended up driving back up to
Washington with four of my buddies in an
[SPEAKER_00]: S10 truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we went up there to go pick up a
little QP up to Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were 16 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the prices was different from up
there to down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think back then we paid $700 for a QP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, or down here, it was probably like
$1,100 at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: $1,100, $1,100, $1,200 for a QP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were pretty much doing what all the
growers are doing now, driving from hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: store to hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably spent the same amount of money
on gas driving up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was for the experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just made that drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: One day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove all the way up in my truck to Port
Orchard, did a delivery, eight pallets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then drove all the way back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made it to a little place in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just crashed out for about two,
three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then drove back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some crazy shit driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I was younger, I used to do
the Riverside from Seattle to Riverside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd go stop in the Bay, drive all the
way down in one shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop in the Bay, drop my buddy off,
drive all the way down to Riverside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive back to the house, which was another
fucking six hours from Riverside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long, long days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My worst one ever was I drove down to I
had like eight pallets of soil on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drove out to Anza out in the desert,
out and down LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drove back to a hydro store in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picked up eight more pallets and drove
back out to Anza and then ended up driving
[SPEAKER_00]: home on the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made it home in 24 hours, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow up and you learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow up and you learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're younger, you're
invincible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking on the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably almost die coming home on the
152.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, the things you do to feed your
children, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I remember being in my early 20s and
we'd drive to Mexico on Friday and home
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday and get go back to work on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those were crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a 10 hour from the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an audit of the hotel to go party for
the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, those were, you know,
honestly, there's a lot of driving 10
[SPEAKER_02]: hours and you know, it's almost a day of
driving to go down for the weekend to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine doing what we used to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't like that's that's getting older,
you know, and understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we just have these mental
limitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could do those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't have any time anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had a buddy asked me the other day,
he goes, you don't smoke that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I don't like to forget
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot on our plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if I forget something,
I feel like I did someone wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so I really kick and keep
smoking to nighttime for now until I can
[SPEAKER_00]: take a little more workload off me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, it just depends on the day
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day is a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in Washington, I smoked a lot on their
memorial for one of my buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so we smoked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I from 14 to 22, I probably smoked
every single day, but 20, maybe 30 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe, you know, or I couldn't I
didn't have money that day or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but from 14 to 22, smoking every
single day is hard, you know, 14 to 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had droughts where we couldn't get weed
some days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nobody had weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't have that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: No such thing as a drought or having to go
over a year since I didn't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a lot more than a year,
but since I didn't have any weed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: house, it's like I've always got something
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine having to call four or
five hooks again to get a 20 sec?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this guy doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling four or five guys to see the
quality now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Availability is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now it's quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, quality is still not
accessible for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't like the stuff that
we're able to get from our mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't even get to see the
stuff on that quality on a daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why it's very easy for me not
to smoke because I go to a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and they try to give me stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a huge difference between good
and wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Night and day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like most of this stuff has
a good effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cherry guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a strong one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like it because it has a good
effect to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It burns clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It burns down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's got, it's pretty potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one before the gushers was G41.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there was a cross with it
or not, but that was the last one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said a cut came from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but see what you're doing with
upping the genetics game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually helping the flower at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's kind of what we're
trying to build in this whole community is
[SPEAKER_00]: A to Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want builders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want advisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want growers, hydro stores,
everybody together as a unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we could see ourselves
furthering this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without you going and having
conversations with another genetics guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: James, you might not learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we always got to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more we communicate with each
other, the more education that comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that's what I see the hydro
stores going back to being eventually is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a transportation hub for education.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more packs guys, you know, education.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grower is going to come into there and
he's going to say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can be the person that transfers
it to another grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I kind of see the future in my
weird way, but going into the grow shop,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have the big screen, like in back to
the future, when he went into the library
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was like, was it back to the
future?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those movies where they went
in the library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I could imagine going in a grow
shop where they have the AI and it's fully
[SPEAKER_02]: trained in whatever questions you have and
it can answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not too far off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the whole reason why we're paying
past food people $20 an hour is because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be taking our order
pretty soon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: AI is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Computers are, you know, really evolved
and it's only just getting, keep getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more crazy genetics, breathing with AI is
the future for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I went to a vertically integrated in
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a produce facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's allowed inside of it,
but robots.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it opened up my eyes,
you know, to a whole nother level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our industry isn't just going to be
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be the traditional side all
coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the same products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think I see some of these
hydro stores turning into like IGCs,
[SPEAKER_00]: independent garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow tomatoes with age old and Royal
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a crop of corn from Royal gold and
it was the best tasting corn that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter has a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like four years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We geek out in a garden together,
me and my daughter, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use vital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Royal gold and for vegetables,
like for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get age old too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going, it's gonna kind of cross paths
and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at like BFG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came into our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a traditional distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're coming into the hydro sector
and now they're merging with Hawthorne.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all this is showing you the
writings on the wall guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry is coming together and
instead of it being a billion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, it's going to be a trillion
dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only because the dollar is getting
devalued.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what inflation is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that the money's worth less as
the dollar is going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The product is still worth the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just valued differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had one advice for your younger
self that was first coming into the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, what would that piece of advice
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not believe in myself, but more understand
you have a key to a huge co-op and listen
[SPEAKER_00]: more to what the people around you are
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for a long time I was running
the business by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of narrow minded and just
driven on what my task was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I couldn't really look outside the
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my first company that I really
started dealing with in this industry was
[SPEAKER_00]: crop protection services.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've now changed their name to
AgNutrient, but this guy Mike Johnson,
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest guy in the world, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came in and he said, how much is this
cow mag?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, I can get you 55 pounds of dry
fertilizer that can make thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of gallons for the same price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I ended up going to all the
hydro stores and I said, Hey guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at dry fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody said, no, nobody's ever
going to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be able to make any
money now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but now I turned to him and I
look at them all and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much money are you guys making off
these products now?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just believe in trust in the circle
around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's educated people around you and
stay open minded to all aspects of their
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of critiques, you know?
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who was the first salt company that had
salt nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're so, I know each had flora
pro and then, but even think, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: over in Europe, I think, uh, was it front
row ag had one too, but I think they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they came from veg bloom, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So veg bloom might be the first,
but, uh, you know, Arian and greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got their greenhouse feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe greenhouse feeding was the
first, but I mean, the concept is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's so silly that we mix these
powder nutrients with water and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: have this fucking crazy footprint and the
carbon footprint is way bigger when you
[SPEAKER_02]: add water than if you ship powder and you
can kind of ship that anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the concept's been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we had some power powder additives and
stuff like that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took us so long to go all the way back
to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it, you know, that's where it
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's amazing with these buffers
and all these other things where you could
[SPEAKER_02]: just use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've used some one part stuff
that, you know, mediocre.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an array of things that we're
trying right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to evolve and the people in the
ag side have been doing this for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's picking some of their brain,
getting away from the name brands that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're so stuck on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's the cannabis tax,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the ag products that are
the exact same product, sometimes they are
[SPEAKER_02]: four X of what they cost in the ag world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that just goes across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're doing with our
nutrient lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking out the margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the ag industry,
there's only a couple of nutrients out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they're the ones that understand
we're not selling secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're selling convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to allow these strawberry growers
to do what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow strawberries and put it on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the same thing as our
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, it's, it's evolving to
where we're not selling secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These liquid fertilizers, these other name
brand fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them for a lot cheaper at your
ag place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and cannabis farmers, the glory and
all this stuff, it's like, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming tomato farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're becoming strawberry farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being, they're being, they're
going to become part of the ag model to a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, wineries, wineries, cut flower
business has gone out of business for the,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where all the greenhouses came from
is cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been walking so many greenhouses
trying to get so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut flowers, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one up here in half moon Bay,
but it has an aqua duck and they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: butter lettuce and they sell it to the
risk Carlton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really intrigued by that because
that's where I see our business going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a couple of steps ahead of the ag
side when it comes to cultivating inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, outside, no, they still have the
upper hand on us, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just how to take out the margins
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Streamline it to where you can have a
really reliable product at an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the double stacks,
they came from lettuce growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're talking triples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen triple stacks at mango spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, that's a lot that you gotta go
way up to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little, it's not safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but everyone's got their own way
of doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's no two ways to,
I mean, there's so many different ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the optimal price per
pound best quality product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that going to come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think they're still going to be
the boutique product that sells for top
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be the either limited
market or the false limited market on it
[SPEAKER_02]: that they control the amount of product
that goes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very limited and it just sells
like crazy, uh, which is like the Doja
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff right now, you know, deep East.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that they're pushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's, it's very limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that'll still fetch a high
dollar no matter what, whether,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, especially, you know,
rec where it's top quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it takes $300 to produce a pound,
which I don't see that changing much,
[SPEAKER_02]: unless the dollar goes down more,
which it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, if we're looking at it from that
perspective, you know, take, take cost
[SPEAKER_02]: 300, how much do you need to stay
profitable for you got a business,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that line, especially with
taxation and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think substitute lighting in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixed light is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I talked about it on my
last podcast, but I think that mixed light
[SPEAKER_02]: is the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can get a amazing quality
product and for, for a lower cost and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're getting the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's drawbacks on both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both sides, but I see the large scale
going that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I've been walking farms all
through Salinas, Watsonville, half moon
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a better understanding,
you know, there's some really high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: glass house projects out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what those costs per square foot
to build.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Venlo's like the Dutch greenhouses
are, it could be more expensive and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of times is more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than an indoor facility build up,
but you're going to save money in the long
[SPEAKER_00]: run on power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are an ag power is a lot cheaper than
commercial power in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got an extra 10 million or 15 to
throw at it, it's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess that's where corporation is
going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where us coming together as a
team and figuring out how do we get an SOP
[SPEAKER_00]: at $200 a pound?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where communication and challenging
each other to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well just sign over the keys
to corporate, you know, and let them take
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fighters and we're not going to turn
it over that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those glass greenhouses are pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tent them with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like the planes that that spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have them spray your, your tent on
this different seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different sprays and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have misters that go back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm trying to get a couple
of guys from our group into a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had, there's one down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 70,000 square feet, has 1300 lights
in it to see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what your ROI is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what's a better situation for
you financially, because everybody might
[SPEAKER_00]: want these boutiques, but one day it might
not fetch that dollar anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be boutique,
but there will always also be the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the race at the bottom
occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you either want to, I mean,
if you're a small boutique company,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to stay small boutique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't cause you'll never compete on
price ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like these guys will be
able to produce stuff for 200 and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to sell it for 400, 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be able to put out, you know,
$5 a decent quality if they want to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: them at seven 11, do you think that's the
future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the face recognition in the screen
where you just put it in there and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispenser that or delivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think drone delivery is definitely
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you're going to see it on the
normal shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, drone delivery probably
already is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be like vending
machine to an extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're saying that at seven 11,
you know, but now how long can you really
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge the shelf life inside that vending
machine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once they dial it in, it's
refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that's the evolution of this
industry, but I'm looking forward to the
[SPEAKER_02]: day where they don't even get the consumer
doesn't even necessarily want to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to get that pre-roll that burns
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you can give them the stuff
that necessarily right now, it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: fit the bill because they have to see the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it was put in a pre-roll and they
smoked it, they'd be like, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or the rosin, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have that with rosin,
but I feel like with pre-rolls and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting there, but it takes, it takes
consumer trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was just going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how you gain that, which would be
a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know what substrate you're using
on those pre-rolls because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: think a pre-roll back in the day when
cannabis places or dispensaries just open,
[SPEAKER_00]: they used all the BS for the pre-rolls,
you know, and it was like, nobody wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke that, you know, but if you can
detail a map for them to where they can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually trust the source, where it came
from, what the plant is, what nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: were used in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the education level on
which people will actually really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I think if you want to know
about my stuff, I think the information is
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly there and even more so the stuff
that we're working on, like with Grodan
[SPEAKER_02]: and Charcor and some of these other
brands, we do publicize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do share with everybody what we're
using, what we're doing to create the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're using a tissue culture plant,
or if we're not using a tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, we state it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the future, we will be doing
everything with tissue culture as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be the standard that
everything's clean and optimal health when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get you on Kaia too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to try the Kaia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing, I won't try to see if it
improves what I do.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of things, but for the
most part, I'm always down to try stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm always looking to improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you have to get rid of
your ego when you're looking at stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the guys with the ego are
the ones that have good products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's the quiet guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm okay working with the big guys
and with the little guys, but I want the
[SPEAKER_02]: best product I can possibly get,
you know, and we're trying United right
[SPEAKER_02]: now and we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited, you know, I'll be able to
share the results with everybody online.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and, and I'm one of those guys that if
I don't like it, I don't talk bad about it
[SPEAKER_02]: because I try so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be the guy that like,
hates on a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a lot of products and I think they
have value and they have value,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe not value for me right now,
but I could see the value for this person
[SPEAKER_02]: or this person or that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and there's so many things to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, it's just like everyone's
environments different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's room is completely not
completely different, but substantially
[SPEAKER_02]: different enough to where you could be
right next door to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have the same nutrients and get
completely different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that all the time actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I don't go into as many gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still stuck behind the desk working on
the phone all day long, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: networking, sourcing, taking care of the
stores, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still in touch with those guys all
day, every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually is going to, I'm going to
use those stores to then expand it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where then they're talking to other
stores, you know, cause it's evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to grow and get better and get to
manufacturers to where we can leverage
[SPEAKER_00]: down the price to get the price a little
lower to keep the growers growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the manufacturers are missing
is if the growers stop growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're out of business too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so let's help each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people can see the word team,
you know, and fight for that, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: objection that will make it in the long
run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if people are looking to find out
more about you, United or Terra
[SPEAKER_02]: International, where would they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to your local hydro store, ask about
Terra International.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can reach out to us and we'll make
sure that they get them their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terra.intl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look forward to hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing your God's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
