[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Lab Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today our special guest is JP from the
Good Pizza Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a wide variety of guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when I was in Barcelona and
they nominated me for podcast of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like you should have been up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a lot of respect for what you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll see you in Barcelona this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should come out to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: As luck would have it, it will be my first
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I feel like there's a
handful of us doing a good job with
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of podcasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really, you're really hitting the
mark with podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You release one a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've, you know, you're on what episode
number 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you just filmed your 100th
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we just filmed 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on 92 right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 92 live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we're on number 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good team.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, it's like so much bigger than
one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like without my team, I wouldn't be able
to do this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have so many people that have
contributed to getting us to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our producer's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then just working the camera
angles and getting this stuff all dialed
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of work and time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations for all your success.
[SPEAKER_03]: This studio is fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get my studio together,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least a fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we've gotten things over a
period of time, but we had an idea coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and we executed on the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually a little bit different
going into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were like, OK, well, here's where
we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went a little bit to the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it turned out for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had we started with different
cameras and realized the cameras we got
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't the cameras we needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are kind of, you know,
there's learning curves with everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then I did podcasts with the Future
Cannabis Project in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was totally different because
we're during Covid and it was all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I much prefer the in-person interviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've yet to do an Internet podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like a legend that there's no
way I'm going to see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone in Europe or Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things might happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and they can be great,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our best episodes was Reggie
Gardino, and it wasn't even the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quality video, but the conversation was
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but there's something to be said about
in-person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more intimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn more about the person,
you know, when you look them in the eye
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: See if you even like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just vibe and build, you know,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you get into podcasting?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got into podcasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, before I launched Good
Pizza, the brand, I knew I needed to
[SPEAKER_03]: create media around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've always wanted to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally had a note in my phone that
was, you know, it was a podcast note.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if I would ever have a podcast,
what other questions would I ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all high thoughts while I'm
driving and I put in my note and then
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, fast forward a couple of
years later when I'm actually about to
[SPEAKER_03]: launch Good Pizza in the Breck market,
like really put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've I've helped I've helped
build brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what it's like to get on their
shelves and come off themselves like you
[SPEAKER_03]: can get lost in the stack easily in
California, Iraq.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to introduce myself before
introducing myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was why I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've I thought podcasts were cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I love Joe Rogan and I
study, you know, I'm saying podcasts like
[SPEAKER_03]: and I didn't even really know what podcast
what a podcast was until like two years
[SPEAKER_03]: before I moved out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what that fucking purple app
was on my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea what that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I tapped it one day and I dealt
and I fell in love, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So long story short, I started the podcast
and I really wasn't taking it too
[SPEAKER_03]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it was just really for the brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, I started to get some
cool guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day, my homeboy Paul from
proper doings told me while we were
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking, he's like, yo, bro, you know,
you're you're literally documenting the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when our grandkids, grandkids watch
these fucking videos, they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: know how it went down, who was there,
who had what strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, bro, you're literally documenting
this shit for the game, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, and it fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It totally shifted my whole paradigm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm like, damn, I got a civic duty
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we have this duty to tell a
story that's so much bigger than any one
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of these podcasts is
like this is the information a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years, two hundred years or three hundred
years that hopefully they'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: look back on and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened in this moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like this is a big turning
point in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, over the last five years,
especially, it's been pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're both in the California
market and it's like very unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of hard to predict what's
going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's great getting all these different
opinions and stories and legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like you've had some
legends on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been blessed to have some
legends on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, Richard DeLisi
spent 32 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the life changing
episodes for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I got some great ones
with other people, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one had a lot of impact on me and
my outlook, why we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one kept me grounded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just interviewed him two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my interview last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was incredible, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like you said, man, like this is
that's Uncle Rick, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's such a character.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, bro, you're not from Florida,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I'm from Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I knew he was one of the guys,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, there's no way with this
fucking accent, this guy's from Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we like we started talking East
Coast and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, dog, you're a legend,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, his stories are legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's like they I can't wait
for the documentary to come out on him and
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to make a movie about his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: His life, you know, he was in a time where
it was way different than it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was way more illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to have way bigger balls and the
punishment was way bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even with him, it's like they
threw the book at him and they didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have any real evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like circumstantial shit,
all circumstantial.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: 96 years, 98 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 some odd years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he served 32 years of almost 100
years sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's kind of mind blowing that
you could put someone in prison that long
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis is becoming normalized,
people are starting to realize that shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff is wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at least I hope I hope even my
parents, you know, they live in Texas
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's very conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Texas is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The landscape changing over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, for as legal, illegal as cannabis is
in Texas, them boys got balls of steel.
[SPEAKER_03]: How they moving over there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're moving mean in Texas, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have, you know, they circumvent
invented the law and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and work within the loopholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all these CBD shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they don't have dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got CBD shops and they're all selling
THCA, you know, and it's, they've got big
[SPEAKER_00]: brands over there, you know, crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that's like the loophole for
legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's also a great way for the
general population, people that live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas to get acceptance over it because
everybody's going out there buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're selling tons of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, yeah, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all these states and how we've
maneuvered in the, the, the problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: California is taxation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Triple tax, bro, to the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Sam is your silent partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncle Sam ain't my uncle.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never came down to my cookouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what got you into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my journey started pretty early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the youngest kid on my block,
single, single mom situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, she was working and nobody
was watching me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I grew up in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an eighties baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, nobody was watching me,
youngest kid on the block.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I naturally got into shit early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just, I was just in Jersey for like
a little friend's reunion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was with the dude that smoked with
me the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came through with all the weed,
all the shrooms and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's looking at me like, you little
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop trying to corrupt us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, corrupt me, bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you, you smoked the joint and
I was 11, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: You was like 17, fool.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat those shrooms, fool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started smoking weed at 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fell in love with it immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really started smoking heavy when I was
12 and I never stopped, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time you smoked, how did you
smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it out of a can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it out of a pipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take a bonger?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had no, we had none of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: No rolling papers, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yo, go to the store and get some
napkins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to the store and got some
napkins and they rolled it up in a napkin
[SPEAKER_03]: and they fucking lit it and it's all
falling apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even get fucking, I didn't even
get high, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably didn't even know how to inhale.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But second time, a can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coke can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coke can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the can, but I do
remember it was out of a can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that got, that got me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I smoked, we were
smoking some banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I got really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like running around like we were
high, but we weren't really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I really got high for the
first time, I was like, Oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I tried a bunch of acid before I
take an acid like 10 times, 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, cause I was, I was into sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I was, I was born in Portland,
but I grew up in the Bay and so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: this huge, grateful, dead community in the
Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acid is everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was this little piece of paper
and I'm like, well, that couldn't be so
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried the paper and I was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was scared of smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was running cross country in high
school and I was sucked at running cross
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was a bigger kid and trying to
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, Oh, if I smoke it,
I'm even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I held out and then eventually I
smoked and I was like, Oh, I found my
[SPEAKER_00]: calling, you know, it's like, and all my
friends, we all smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like everybody, once we got exposed
to the good stuff, especially it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's all it was hard to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we had the Bamer,
we had the brown weed, the Mexican stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that had lots of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proto pipes were big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had those pipes that we buy in Berkeley
that had the resin chamber and you put the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud in there and it would get all
resonating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was super illegal back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were, you know, they were getting
in trouble, you know, 90s of smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I smoked was 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started growing, grew in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evolved from there, you know,
in the garage, closet to a garage,
[SPEAKER_00]: garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the longest time, I was scared to go
to like warehouse grows and my buddy who
[SPEAKER_00]: went from growing in my garage with me,
went into a bigger space, 50 lighter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was huge for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a warehouse, he got busted at the
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, Oh, I don't want to do
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, the, the thing is, is like,
you could have an eight lighter in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garage and be extremely profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was making good money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was interesting times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, you know, where were you
running?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing in my garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this Oregon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the spear blueberry that we grow
real tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I didn't realize they were going to
double.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we vegged them a little too long
and then they grew up into the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then we had a Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but even before that, there was like
the spaceship, the Romulan, the shaman,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Jack flash that my friend
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody kind of grew their own
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we grew Bubba for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a huge Bubba fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still, I just got some, I got some Bubba
down here, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Bubba on the way to my crib
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had like the master,
the Bubba, and then the OG came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before that, it was like the Hindu
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, Kush is in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the OGs on my show, their faces,
just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look up into the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yeah, man, that Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Fields from Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my old co-host Jamie, fucking whoever,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hindu was special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so Hindu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had cat piss around the same
time in the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it turned on to cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changed my perspective on ugly
weed too, because it was the ugliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one we used to get was just shreds in
a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like little podules, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were getting these little bracks a
lot of times, stringy, ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the smell, and it was so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole room would smell like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hands would smell like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had like this ammonia skunk and it
wasn't gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not gas like people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sour ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really pissy smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like real piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but one 10th of a gram would smell
the whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally you could have a 10th of a
gram and you go home and your parents
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know I had it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I got, I got it on the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, this is before, like we had
names on bags and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably like oh six.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time I ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and looking back to it,
like that was cat piss, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody ever told me it was cat piss,
but like dog, it smelled like piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ammonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I've never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That had to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: $60 straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, the thing is, is like, so cat piss
is the description of a smell and aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's multiple cat piss is
what people think of cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, you know, SoCal cat piss,
NorCal cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other cat pisses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard there was even cat pisses back in
the seventies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it's a description of an
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be multiple copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a blue dream, which is a
specific name, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like there's a lot of arguing
going on online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh yeah, I had the real cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you did have the real cat piss for
you, but that doesn't mean it was the only
[SPEAKER_00]: cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing with blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's, there's a Canadian
blueberry, a DJ short blueberry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all extremely different in
structure, smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got some Canadian blueberry the
other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brendan, it was really blueberry as much
as the DJ short or as much as the Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was blueberry turps, like blueberry
turps to the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I seen blueberry turps was
semi recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cam was running some, something blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just brought me back to like the DJ
short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's what I had, I had it like one
time in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJs was short and squatty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before I even seen a weed plant,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: East coast days.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't see weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the first stuff you were
seeing around on the East coast?
[SPEAKER_03]: So first stuff is obviously, you know,
Mexican brick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say the first cool thing I ever saw
was like Jamaican red hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was like fucking 12,
13 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that was like the first time
I was like, wow, this is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like one homie would have like a
fucked up little shady gram and a
[SPEAKER_03]: cigarette self fame with California kind
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you smoke a little ass bowl of it
between like five people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, oh, my God, this tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I so high off one or two hits?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was on from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like whatever I could get like from
California, like whatever kind,
[SPEAKER_03]: but whatever the fuck that was,
or we call it dro, like any good weed we'd
[SPEAKER_03]: call it dro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why this is what we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: KGB, dro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of nicknames.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Beasters, you know, a lot of
Beasters came through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, like the first dope weed,
like I don't know what it was because we
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have names for it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like some, you know, some dope
California kind, but and then the hazes
[SPEAKER_03]: came through.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: The hazes were like the first thing that
stuck, like purple haze, Cuban black haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: We would skip school, drive to Washington
Heights or Spanish Harlem, bring my boy
[SPEAKER_03]: Puerto Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: He speaks Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: He do the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a bunch of dimes, like 20 dimes and
go back to our town and sell them for 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying just a quick bubble up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid little kid shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I realized really fast, like how
quickly you could be the man in your town
[SPEAKER_03]: if you had something that nobody had,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was a young boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the youngest kid, always the
youngest kid in my crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I would see the tables turn
like some older homies want to hang out
[SPEAKER_03]: with you now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This shit's got power, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was in Boy Scouts when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, OK, not saying anything bad about the
Boy Scouts, but there was a lot of action
[SPEAKER_00]: going on the Boy Scouts with weed,
really drugs and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it wasn't what people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and there was a good sign,
you know, and I don't think of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad thing, but definitely there was a
lot of weed getting passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I got exposed to it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Boy Scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout to the Boy Scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best stuff came from one of my
friends, Mr. Scott in the Boy Scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a senior patrol leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the senior patrol leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his brother were going the most
killer weed back in the day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, unbelievable high times
winning cannabis cup seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what they had told us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's high, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you reminded me of a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I went to New York on a
trip as an adult was 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going there for work.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to this restaurant called Nooks
that was by the Empire State Building.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dude named Jimmy the Greek owned
Nooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next thing you know, he's like,
oh, you want to hang out with me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if I can get some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he takes me out and he gets me this
white bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never seen white weed in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the whitest weed I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story, the BS story, which is most
likely BS, was that it was grown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sewers with the alligators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it was white because of the
lack of, you know, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah, but everyone's got the
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the weed was white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like light burn, but it was so
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually flew back home with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in a pen cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flew back home with it because I had
to show all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to get it out with,
you know, you had to get a needle to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this little tiny piece of it to
smoke with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like the whitest weed I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was probably light burn looking back
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it was 100 bucks for a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if anybody knows where Jimmy the
Greek is, man, I'd love to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy the Greek.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how many Jimmy the Greeks are out
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this Jimmy the Greek owned Nooks Cafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, copy, copy, copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can find him hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find him, Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with 9-11, Nooks was long gone
after 9-11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was always good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that's the thing about New York,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're guaranteed to see something crazy
or something crazy going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're just doing New York,
like weird shit happens in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking crazy city.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: The best city in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember my first experience seeing
something bugged out kind of like that in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York with my big cousin, Den.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: 12, 13, he's like 16, 17, 18, some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, he wanted to get some
shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yo, I want to get some shrooms,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going back to my mom's crib in
Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: My boy Bobby across the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they were tight because they were the
same age.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just chilling right on this
stoop smoking a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this dude comes up to my cousin,
this weird ass shady fucking white dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, it was my cousin.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yo, Jimmy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, what's up, fool?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is chopped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yo, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find these shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, y'all got some shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: So my cousin shrooms right on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought my cousin was Jimmy, whoever the
fuck that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I'm like, yo, how the fuck did
you manifest that, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was just like some rando ass New
York shit, like some 1990s fucking,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: NYC shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the 90s were a special time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the genetics were way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was popular in the box was pretty
much everything that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have to be purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have to be candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to this day, I mean, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was candy a little bit,
but I mean, there was like juicy fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like some juicy fruit,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some sweet weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afgui.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Afgui is kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was, you know, in the sweet
fruity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a handful of things that
were sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as like Mendo perps,
we used to go to Mendocino and get purple
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was around back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never seen that back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd have lost our fucking minds if we'd
seen purple weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was definitely, that was like
$4,500 a pound in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like outdoor was as expensive or more than
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, especially the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I remember the outdoor being so
amazing back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there was a lot less of it
that there is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there was a lot of people that
were super passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had to be more passionate about
it because you were taking more risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much on the line and there
were still people that grew mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had friends that just grew
mediocre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there's this ego thing
that when you grow it yourself and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been with the plant for that long and you
harvest it, that you take pride in however
[SPEAKER_00]: you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some friends like that and
their stuff is mid grade and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize sometimes when your stuff is
mediocre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to be very, subjective,
you know, and honest with people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm growing, it's like, I constantly
am trying, how can I make this better each
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's never good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the best growers out
there, they're never fully satisfied with
[SPEAKER_00]: each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something they could
improve on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And know what else?
[SPEAKER_03]: They want your feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're like a real curator,
like myself and other people, like with
[SPEAKER_03]: brands that give a fuck about quality,
like they really do want your opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we set the egos aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to set the egos aside and look at
it separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we're pheno hunting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we're going through,
you know, 700 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work, but like you're really
trying to find the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do that is getting
honest feedback from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and also I quit giving people flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done with giving people flour with
pheno hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you get joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give you pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to tell me how does it taste
and how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two most important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavors are especially hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of stuff looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to, you want to pick one that
looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag appeal is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you got Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you got Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you got Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it has like, it's like, you know,
kind of cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it doesn't have great bag
appeal, but it also fetches high dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five in the street, 10 in the bed,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and it's not easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like that's one of those
ones that deserves more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You deserve more money for growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think about all these
Skittles crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: The diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen anything that's as good as
Skittles that's across the Skittles?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you what, I just interviewed
Ted from Alien Labs for the second time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it round two.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my first round two episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said it the best and I never even
thought of it like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Ted.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, bro, why are we chasing all
these fucking Skittles crosses,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing better than Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you going to beat the top?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why are we trying to do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know what we're all thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was chasing it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've I've done phenol hunts with
Z-Crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I popped hell of a shit of Z-Crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, bro, they just don't do it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, going through Skittles S1s is silly,
in my opinion, because you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find anything better than the original
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might find some good stuff and
Skittles Crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something that's completely
different or it's like like Moonbow is
[SPEAKER_00]: really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Moonbow from Archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is a great Skittles
Cross.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rain Shadow Runs from Kano Organics up
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got those seeds on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little collaboration thing we
did with Kyle and Tim from from Squam.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have cousins in Squam, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, their facility is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, their their greenhouses and outdoor
grows are bar none the best in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor wise, dude, the stuff burns good,
tastes good, checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great seeing people grow organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a handful of friends that grow
really good flour in Metric up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, and they're definitely one of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the only other person in the world
I ever heard say the word Squam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that shit is like it's the smallest
little town.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get across some body of water
to get there type shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This this is like what I'm excited about
as far as like if we're going to be in
[SPEAKER_03]: like a Skittles Cross kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's just super unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a collab, a breeding collab
project between 3rd Gen and Land Race
[SPEAKER_03]: Indian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this was hunted by Kadre Verde,
the homie Trent from Kadre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kadre hunted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They selected the number 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really called Superman Ice Cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, number 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's blue shirt by Eddie Leopold G by
Rainbow Belts 2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like Z in their way.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Z in there, but it's super complex
belts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually was able to give some of that
to Fletcher when I finally met him in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York for 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was happy to give him some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you liked it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's dope, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm fucking with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I'm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to bring some light to that
flavor, you know, and people seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: really like it, you know, I just I just
feel like it's just need a name change
[SPEAKER_03]: because the ice cream tripped me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody likes ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad because I think really good ice
cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got flooded on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so same thing with wedding cake,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good bready wedding cake that's
gassy and bready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ice cream cake makes great
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the rosin is phenomenal if you do it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pick it early, like I really like
that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then same thing with the flour,
if it's done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I think there's a lot of
inferior cuts out there and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people growing shitty versions of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it puts a bad name out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then JBZ, he released wedding cake
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 30 different phenotypes out there
that people are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this all started, I'm pretty sure
that those wedding cake seeds that went
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that'd be the only explanation
for why there's so many phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they're S1s for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, I think that wedding
cake is the best example because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four decent ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that's just phenomenal that
smokes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't yield as much as like the ones
my buddy grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They yield like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gives me that purple punch letdown,
which I mean, I feel like that's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go a little longer, too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a little bit longer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I moved here, cakes were still
popping, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cakes were fucking nice and greasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alien Labs had a dope cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Alien Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been crushing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should get Ted on the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's fucking the best interviewer,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your interview with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that and the Caleb interview was
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one with Caleb was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed that thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got to get up with bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good times, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun being able to hear different
stories from different people and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: different perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was like turning point cannabis
world shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys are working with some of
the best genetics out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they understand cannabis on a
level that's much different than a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the business side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how much do we learn on our
podcast about business?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm there for you guys, but I'm really
taking notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ted, Caleb, Bernard, I just did an
interview yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really asking them, like, yo,
so how'd you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me about the corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you form a corporation?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm fucking like, dawg, you did it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's proof that anybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like back to what you're saying,
like these interesting people,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, let's talk about like the
whole how the cookie shit went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I think you should get
interviews from Berner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should get Jigga.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should get Shurbinski.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should get Flux, Straight
Flame and Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of all those stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kenny Powers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenny Powers especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He don't want to hop on.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I'll get him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, and they're all different
versions of the story, obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: because as you've seen it through your
lens, but like you'll get like the big
[SPEAKER_03]: picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: When First Smoke did all their interviews,
like I would tell people, yo, you really
[SPEAKER_03]: want to know the cookie story?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening in these podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in all those guys'
perspectives because each story is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of this whole thing
is like we're able to get these different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives from different people and
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have a different lens that
we've seen the world through because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: all went through different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and we're in an amazing time
because it's not stabilized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure where it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics is still, we're scratching the
surface of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fully patented yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, people aren't out of the
game because they don't have money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still be an amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do it with a small handful of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to grow really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, it's all about
like, can you grow really well and make
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant express?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can tell the difference between the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and there's a handful of people doing
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of people doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's so subjective to what
good genetics are, but I think we could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably smoke a handful of joints and
agree that these ones are all great and
[SPEAKER_00]: these ones are all mediocre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we might have a difference of
preference at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like White Ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion on White Ash?
[SPEAKER_03]: White Ash is the last check box,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to get off that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we brought this White Ash fucking
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we curse on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say whatever the fuck we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motherfucking right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So White Ash, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look for four things, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give props to proper joints for
kind of like enlightening me to these
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I always knew they were there,
but I never knew what to look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I go by flavor translation,
strength of flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor longevity is big for me because I
don't like joints that like taste like
[SPEAKER_03]: shit halfway through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if you got a joint that tastes
like shit halfway through, I just sold you
[SPEAKER_03]: half ounce for whatever I sold for or half
an eighth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're not going to smoke the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not smoking that, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then so after flavor, flavor longevity
is smoothness.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to throw roast and joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's burning super hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once when all those it seems like
when all those things check the boxes,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy shit, the way is that the ash is
really white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so and that's, you know,
combustible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always the case, but a lot of
times I have some some genetics that just
[SPEAKER_00]: do not get white ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be sawing pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be sawing pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't be black though.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they will not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they will not be black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't nothing wrong with a little pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, look, if it's burning white,
do I get excited?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: People get pumped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to buy your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the world we live in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can add a couple points on that
pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucking can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even sell it if it's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've created pigeonholed myself in
this little fucking connoisseur corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like it all has to check out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like good pizza is also a standard of
weed like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it goes through all that,
that's my QC process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's good pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll put it in my bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it don't, it's a work pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's a good place to
pigeonhole yourself in, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's way better than the other
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottom is rough right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys are just dying off left and
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's really hard to maintain a
product where you're in competition with
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys that can produce for $250 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: $300 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you even want to be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time where you got to,
you got to be on the other end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the best product,
there's no reason really doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the connoisseur market is the 1%,
10%, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is a significant amount of people
based on how many people smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can still get tickets in that
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did brand at the fucking perfect
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're selling bags, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're chasing 25 cents nowadays,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you get a box play with your
mans, y'all splitting a quarter or 50
[SPEAKER_03]: cents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's getting dollars no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the ones that aren't working
in volume, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that are, you know, the boutique
guys that are like, OK, $4,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: $4,500 a year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, those guys are still making 200
points.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making more than I sell a fucking box,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sell a fucking five pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wild world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still the wild, wild west.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is the same thing with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the best or something
different, like you can't just do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as everybody else anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just isn't going to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if you haven't figured that out as a
breeder, that you can't just go make
[SPEAKER_00]: another gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason even doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get a lot of money for
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're making really, really stable
seeds that you can throw an acre worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out, you're not going to have
intersex trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there is market for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a lot more difficult than it is
to make a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making something that's super stable that
you can put out in the field is not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to harm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of R&D involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work and time and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I get money for my seeds
that don't have intersex trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put five acres out or 10 acres
out and reliably get a good crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have some of those gelato turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moving forward, it's like you want to
have something that's going to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: your customer from everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main job is to empower my customers
to grow better flour, to get better
[SPEAKER_00]: results, and have something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like banana turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a banana OG, that shit was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a banana that's amazing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a banana OG times banana punch
times skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a banana skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got reg seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hunted them up in Washington at House
of Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with a lot of Washington brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Oregon originally, Portland,
Oregon, but I have friends and family up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Squim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been to Squim?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to Squim many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some good videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Squim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go to Canna Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kyle, he's another one you got to get
on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where he is?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where he's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he fucking Squim?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just talking about Jordan's boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, stop playing with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in Squim.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Squim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like the organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my cousin, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably does.
[SPEAKER_03]: My cousin's a grower up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might even work for Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's like, and these guys,
it's like this banana skittles is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This, we call it banana skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the banana runs candy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more banana runs candy than the
banana runs flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have this, it's a fake banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It washes really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It washes it like five and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fucking go, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the rosin tastes like banana candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn, dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made a bunch of crosses with this
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a cross with Fort Collins
Kauff, Chem 91, Apples and Bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, so many different really,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to buy some of those seeds off
you, boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hunt through those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a ton of really good stuff to hunt
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got two farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a lot of pretty much 89% rosin
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I originally made the seeds to take to St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: Caribbean island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there with Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a reggae singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get him on the show too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's another, he's like one of my best
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, plug me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he took me to St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the poorest islands I've ever been
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even one of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the, it was my exposure to what
real poverty is, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how happy the people are that are
living in poverty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to see that as an American.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me realize that maybe I could
do something to help these people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their economy revolved around bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, let's make some banana
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to go give the minister of
agriculture banana crosses, 20 of them in
[SPEAKER_00]: seed form to give out to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was my idea with Marlon years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally with COVID, it delayed this
whole process, but now we're going out
[SPEAKER_00]: next month to give these seeds away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's so cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a contribution to the game and
humanity, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's what we all need to do
is figure out ways we can help other
[SPEAKER_00]: people step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and I think there will,
there'll be some media coverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not even about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about being able to give something
that can empower other people to make
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations on that project,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, giving back like that,
whatever you put into stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it pays you back tenfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, that's a nice little check mark
on the good karma side of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got to do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canadians, there's a bunch of Canadian
LPs that went into St. Vincent and Jamaica
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these others, and they were all
about making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're basically trying to take
out of the island, off of the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to extract money off of
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I don't want to be that
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go in there to help the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about the money there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we don't make a penny,
which I assume we probably won't,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get some good publicity and stuff,
but we're going to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to help people that need
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's a lot of people,
this is only one island.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people all over the world that
need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, we, as Americans, Americans have
the power to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the weed laws like on St.
Vincent?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can they cultivate medical?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have medical licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they have, dude, they have a,
they have a spiritual license too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a, yeah, it's like a religious
license because cannabis is a religious
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, they have this biblical
sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went there and spoke to the cannabis
authority, which is their governing body
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Marlon, I was, it was supposed to be
like a 30 minute little lecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: who we are or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a three hour lecture and they kept
raising their hands, asking more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, can we just keep going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first time in my life where the
government was like, and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: government, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people from the government that
were like, we want to make our people
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking about pollen mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you don't want regular seeds on
the island necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get rid of mails because such
a small island, there has to be pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't pollinate people's crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the things we talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they wanted to know about indica
and sativa and THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, THC isn't the end all
be all, which I think is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important, especially from a medicinal
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people at St. Vincent and the
government there is really into the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal side of it and how can they make
their people better?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can it benefit their people in a good
way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even the minister of agriculture,
they're amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to meet him and sit down with him
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm looking forward to being able
to sit down with him again and present him
[SPEAKER_00]: with some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice suit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is fucking incredible, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's just, it's part of why I
do this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like at the end of the day,
I got my breeding book too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you'd seen the book,
but I got a book for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we, because it's a much bigger
project, just like this podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 380 pages, I had over 20
contributing writers that contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: little pieces, photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some PIF in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some Cuban black haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got those in tissue culture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking within the next month and a
half, two months, we'll have plants of PIF
and Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess somebody run a couple of lights of
that for me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little something for the head,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like PIF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuban black is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is that PIF?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm hearing is PIF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe, I think the PIF is S one of
the Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause these are two different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're genetically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we were with my flora and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to do some testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell that these plants are
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how they're related, I'm not sure,
but I believe that one of them is an S one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the PIF is probably the one
that we have is an S one of the Cuban
[SPEAKER_00]: black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, it's not one of those
sativas that shoots you off like a space
[SPEAKER_00]: rocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not shooting out of a cannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get high, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get high, but it's more subtle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the super silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like smoking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's, it's, it's got to,
you know, it doesn't burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't burn on the pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns tasty all the way down to the
roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's like a little tiny bit
floral, a little tiny bit haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its own unique thing going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about super silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the PIF, the PIF.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like incense, nog champa,
kind of like spicy, peppery turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's grown correct, it right down
to that roach though, it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can, I can smoke the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the super silver, if I'm smoking
myself and I smoke a big joint like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, I'm smoking it down to about
here by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, whereas if I smoke Skittles like this,
I can smoke a couple of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just sitting and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was telling you like,
I smoked Skittles and Fugazi on my show,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's like, I could smoke them all
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get right, just right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could keep flowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my buddy Kyle and I, we did a show
and we smoked some of his strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_00]: and I could tell that he harvested it
extra late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how like, if you go past the
harvest date a little bit or where you
[SPEAKER_00]: could harvest it, it's stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Skittles, if you go 63 days or 65
days, longer and stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Skittles especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles you got to take a 52 to 54.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 53, anywhere 52, 56 even is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the difference if you want those
melon turps or if you want the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that gas comes in a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need the gas, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make me feel as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were talking about the way it makes
you feel, I don't like the 63 day
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it makes me feel as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I like that 50 and I love that
taste where you just want to keep hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep coming back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fire the roach up the next day and
still smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of that Skittles too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dog, it's still the big dog on the
block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gelatos come and go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Runts is still here, but Runts,
you're not getting tickets for Runts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's going Runts and LCG,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Runts, LCG, cause you're familiar with
these sex tests and like what's what
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Runts, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gelato 33, LCG, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Runts, LCG, depending on who you get the
cut from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're, they're slightly
different cuts, but I think they all came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally there was Runts and there was
one Runts and that cut got renamed to LCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they got another cut that they
called Runts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the Gelato 33 mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a lot of stuff that's Gelato
33 out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen the, I've seen the
actual tests that this and this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the same side of the equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The white, yeah, white Runts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, so Gelato 33 is the most
unstable of anything I've ever worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you make S1s of it,
in the sense that genetically unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is when you make S1s,
you get all these different expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: SF Kana has several different ones that
are just S1s of Gelato 33 with different
[SPEAKER_00]: names on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're completely different
expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the cherry guava?
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cherry guava is different,
but that's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's special, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's what there was scheduled.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a good batch of that, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to have some today,
but their grower, he wasn't even,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's busy in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's some of my favorite,
especially the last batch of it that just
[SPEAKER_00]: came out is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it in a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be really up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as good as it was, but it drips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got the drip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it tastes like candy,
you know, and that's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have like Mount Fuji and Gelato X
and a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just never liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but those are all Gelato 33 S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are just S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my knowledge, those are all,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's seven of them or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked at them side by side,
you'd be like, oh, they're completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different, but really they're like
sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gelato is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the 41 a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: 41 is the king, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: 41 is the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 41 is a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the breeder cut, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that time scales make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's extremely special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I know one of our,
I can't really say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this needs to be said or
supposed to be said, but your boy Kyle
[SPEAKER_03]: bred something that's super special.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a 41Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the rain shadow runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some of those left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're selling for 500 bucks a pack
on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell them occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Fino Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super, I'm Fino hunting some right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you where I'm bringing it after
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you exactly where I'm bringing
that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and that one, that rain shadow
runs, checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, that's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that's really what it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it so bad, but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know exactly what you're going to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and there's a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them that he Fino
hunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Glulato is special too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Gorilla Glue times Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that one's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that P90 bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that King Louie times Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Gelato 41, it adds super stable
and it adds this amazing flavor where I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like it can make, if you Fino hunted
correctly, you could find ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor you're looking for,
but more intense sometimes than the
[SPEAKER_00]: original.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to 41, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been like, yeah, that's a staple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the straight 41 is amazing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow, you can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's fairly easy to grow good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Skittles is hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a learning curve with Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato 41, I think a lot of people could
get that cut and they could do pretty well
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like Blue Dream, that's another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my favorite Terp, but it grows
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I started growing out here,
I crushed a run of Outdoor 41,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so proud of myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I bombed the next round,
but whatever, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you know, you learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about OG?
[SPEAKER_03]: You see any good OGs later?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truly Kimber.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's floating back around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's up in SAC right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a facility rocking that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some really good, a good batch of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also Triple X OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Ash is running that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Make OG Great Again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a little Make OG Great Again
campaign that's grown by Kajre Verde.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Trap Jesus is supposed to have some
fucking crazy OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some on the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll let you know next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian from Vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever get him on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll give you the real OG flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is he?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's he looking?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at Grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not too far off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows really, really good OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: GV's my second home, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crush it with the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: His is, you know, Vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got really good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he's my go-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and Royal Gold are my two soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I get my.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never met him, but I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do booths with them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Reggae on the River with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you got to go next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Tahoe Reggae Fest.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Reggae on the River is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to be working with
KanaFest next year and we're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: an area and we're going to be doing
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to come up there and do a
podcast for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be tight, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invite right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's at Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: KanaFest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So KanaFest is actually in a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggae is usually the first weekend in
August.
[SPEAKER_03]: In August, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be up in a couple of weeks at
KanaFest as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a cool event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Reggae on the River is classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the best sound system I've ever
heard for an outdoor event.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just the most amazing artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A river.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four days of amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I went four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went, cause I had a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in on Thursday and then we stayed
till Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's kind of like five days,
but like, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long is the actual festival?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's amazing artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little older now, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to party.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got VIP camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the nice, it's under a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a chef too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make the best pizza too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been having this little debate
with Obsolete and Mango and myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who makes the best pizza?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mango looks like he knows what he's doing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't sleep on them Florida boys,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes the best calzones I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he fucks his pizza up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has to flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, but I'm telling the,
I'm challenging those guys to a $500
[SPEAKER_00]: buy-in bet for who cooks the best pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I heard about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I see this on Instagram recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: You totally did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Sergio's in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get Sergio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he went to culinary school.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a chef too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I think we're going to do
some fun either here, maybe at your spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a portable pizza oven too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this little rock box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a nice lounge in my spot,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: To set the pizza up right down outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crush some good pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do thin crust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about the thin crust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do Detroit too, but Detroit's like easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to make a really good Detroit
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to do it in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of time and effort that goes
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of bread to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't need a lot of carbs myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I've been good on my diet
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down 30 pounds of fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on over 10 pounds of muscle,
so I'm down like 40 pounds of fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exercise, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exercise is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me it's weight lifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would have thought?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little exercise, a little diet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I diet too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, dieting, but when you exercise and
you show up at the gym, it makes you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to diet on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to eat shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's like, I'm like, I don't know
how many chances I'm going to have left to
[SPEAKER_00]: like lose the weight and to be in good
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: You in your forties?
[SPEAKER_00]: 47.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the back half and I'm looking at it
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, some people look at it
like, oh, we have all this time left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like time is very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: My time is limited here to get all this
stuff done that I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I'm pretty ambitious as a person
and I have a lot of goals that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's no better time than
the present to get on those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you never know how much time you got
left.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's a beautiful time to do
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, we, a lot of people
think that the world it's getting worse
[SPEAKER_00]: and worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's getting better in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the economy's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's stuff like the economy,
but I think other than Oakland,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot safer in most places than it
used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any laws in Oakland,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco is pretty bad too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, but not like Oakland,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's like Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't work there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I mean, there are people
that can work in Oakland safely,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel, I don't care too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't want to expose myself to
that kind of danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make day trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, they still got amazing weed coming
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking, it's a coupe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I come from a fucked up place too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, there's beauty in that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it creates beautiful people
and like tough people and like you need
[SPEAKER_03]: tough people to like get through the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that we got a lot of
snowflakes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm from Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: We break balls as a sport, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a sign of affection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell you go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're probably my mans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't say that to just anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't know, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different times, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hard times create soft men,
soft men create hard times and hard times
[SPEAKER_00]: create or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a generational thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every three generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my father's generation, they were
tougher than nails, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like my grandfather's
generation was even harder and tougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like those guys,
you know, it's like they're fighting the
[SPEAKER_01]: wars, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real world wars, real world wars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poverty was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go hunt for your food too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my father, he came from North
Dakota, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, they, they hunted for their
food a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather could hold a hundred pound
anvil out straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was younger, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, he was like 6'1",
6'2", probably didn't weigh more than 180,
[SPEAKER_00]: 590 pounds, but he was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew up on a farm or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm boy strength, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with my uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncle Corey could hold a hundred pound
anvil out and lock his elbow and toss you
[SPEAKER_00]: across the room and toss you across the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my father's generation, my father was
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember I saw my father fight,
you know, I saw a lot of that growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father was tough, really tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't see that, you can't fight
like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have guns, people have knives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before people would get a problem,
you could duke it out in the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just, you know, that was the way
of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have stayed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people wouldn't talk as much shit
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like they're hiding behind
their little keyboard and they want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I was just saying that away
here, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yo, I was, I could tell that dude
ain't been punched in the mouth in a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of years, you know, or if ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just need a good punch in the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a little slap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like a good slap, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to know your three favorite,
because you ask everybody their three
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your modern, your classic and your
desert island.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so back in the day, we're going to go
sour, desert island.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go Skittles and some new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, the new ones, the tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's where all the, you know,
someone's new shit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go candy fumes times permanent
marker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave from Preferred Gardens bred that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 50 Finos, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've picked I've smoked probably 20,
20 and change them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got five fucking hitters in my notes and
he's going to run one of them for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully to 49.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got I think I'm locking in the
49 for the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you tried the 11 coffins of the
coffee and candy from planta yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally my favorite candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coffee and candy is literally my favorite
candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good that warheads.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think coffee and candy is just a
little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've been crushing the batches,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Derek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Derek's coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Derek on yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to have Derek.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Freddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had Freddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually coming on my show two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know, shout to Freddie,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked him, I was like, yo, brother,
I've seen you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it like, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucked with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, bro, it was the best production
experience I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets first place for smoking the most
on my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the ones that come through the
jar full of joints and right after
[SPEAKER_03]: another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's chilling, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember his first episode, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came through and fucking just blew it
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does good business.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good dude, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a solid dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a guy, better friend than an
enemy, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a fighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's a big boy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were we saying right before that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had something to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before coffin candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, no, no, coffin candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said 11 coffins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to give a shout out to my bro,
Dirt Road Exotics, my bro, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm rocking his 11 coffins in my brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just finished it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hunted some seeds from Duke of Urb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And found his cut or his his Finos.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number here's number one, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bro, it's fucking fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's like RS 11 on fucking steroids,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything you missed about the
original RS 11 drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sending you home with some RS 11
from tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RS 11 from tissue culture is so
different than RS 11 when it first
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the clone drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, not the big clone drop,
but when they were growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when Deep East, Wizard Trees, Doja,
I think they were all growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, when the packs first dropped
and they were like forty five hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the it was the wake up call for me
on like I need to step my game up because
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bag my friend gave me and it was
all graded.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when they first started really
grading where it was like the ABCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, God, you there was no big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all even across the board and they
were all perfectly shaped round buds in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the best graded I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like bees a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty five hundred and now I had to get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, oh, the thing is,
the nose hit you like it was like ice
[SPEAKER_00]: cream on the nose with a little gas on the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a little floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like floral ice cream with this gas
on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever happened along the way,
whether there was different genetics or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, I feel like it changed and it
wasn't like it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think it's the clone drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think it's this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when they scaled it, too,
I think scaling it doesn't always work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got it from tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tissue cultured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like RS-11 a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Zope a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's two Zope cuts, too,
that go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zope is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two Zope cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there's two Zope cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get Deep East.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get Rob on the show or something
like that to verify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's definitely like a spear
Zope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like the more rounded bud
Zope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're both good in their own
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I never really got into Zope like
everybody, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get me high like that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a flavor chaser.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's go back to RS-11 for a second,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know when somebody tells you something
that you never thought of before and just
[SPEAKER_03]: fucks the whole thing up like a nice meal,
or like, yo, I love this dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yo, you know, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, fuck, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just fucks with you forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just stains your memory and your
palate, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ted, fucking Ted from Alien Lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking to RS-11 one day,
like not too long after a drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, bro, that shit is diet
sherbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't been able to shake it since.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of like when it kind of
started being whack, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, fuck RS-11, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was exposed to the best RS-11 packs that
came out when it was all small batch,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were only released in a handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my first time smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, I love good Sunset
Sherbert, the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting packs off Sherbinski in
2012, 13-ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's fucking go, dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was getting them from Sherbinski,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The original shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got over to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started seed companies off of bag
seeds that were in that Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some seed companies that built
their brand off of that bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stuff was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never really fully got its day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of people like- No,
it didn't, bro, because Gelato came right
[SPEAKER_03]: after, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after and it kind of just took over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sherbert deserved its day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way more, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it'll never get it,
obviously, because now people kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hating on it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, man, it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just as amazing as any one of the
Gelato cuts, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it better than Gelato, bro,
to be real with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the effect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the last batch I went fucking
psycho over was Loud THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loud THC was growing this Sherb,
and it was just fucking incredible,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it from Exotics916.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his favorite shit Sherb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Jesus, Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diet Sherb.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a funny one, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard diet Sherb, but- I say diet
sour a lot, because all the sour is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro, there's no gas, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new one I've been hearing a lot
lately, too, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much diet Skittles on the
market, and it's all garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's garbage, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hate to let anybody down,
but- It is what it is, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is, is all the Skittles crosses
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of them, like Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainbow Bow's 2.0 is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Moonbow is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that Moonbow from Florian Flame,
it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's only a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the first time I smoked the
RS-11, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got me so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted so good, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted so good down to the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: My homie Chaz from Friendly Farms came
through and burned it with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, bro, what the fuck is
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the little fucking weed nerd in me,
I'm on the hunt now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't find this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it at, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are not- What batch was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What fucking group?
[SPEAKER_03]: What camp did that come out of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then I think Zope, there was
some handful of batches that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Zope that were phenomenal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Zope got a little bit of hate,
but Zope was popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it first dropped, it was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brand blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not getting tickets no more,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking flooded, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some stuff to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out there, bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a dark nug, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some purple sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the scariest looking nug I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the purplest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the purplest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that- Bro, this shit is black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I used to have pink panties that
would get like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's purple sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit is called black sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the contact for the guy who is the
keeper of the cut.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm looking forward to getting that
in rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do some breeding with it with my
autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy looking, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wowzers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I roll up some of this right here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: This fucking triple fucking quadruple back
cross fucking Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4XL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Lempire Forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: This smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a nice smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four Z's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tree Z's.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is four Z's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating names is not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't understand how hard
it is to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I got my GP3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my Gary Payton cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've got a lot of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing with Loud is I can put it
on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody else has it and I really like
the name, I could just put Loud on the
[SPEAKER_00]: front of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's tight, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many names have been
taken and it's like, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: step on people's toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, if they don't have a
big following or if it's not a really
[SPEAKER_00]: popular genetic, if it's old, it's kind of
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, especially if it's
something that describes the smell or the
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma or the flavor perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's the first goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're selecting names, that's the
first goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we name it after something that smells
like or tastes like, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then sometimes that doesn't always
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, okay, I can go into desserts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go into the Italian stuff because
I'm an Italian brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go down that lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of the good names are taken,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I got a Frank Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if anybody else's name
did that, but I got a Frank Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look, that's what we need, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the weird randos.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the game needs, because the
names back in they were so much better,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were so fucking random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Romulan, Alaskan Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, give me a better one than that
train.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people getting creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and that was in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Breaths had a cool series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pogs Breath, Morning Breath, Mendo Breath,
Peanut Butter Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a cool series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandpa's Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandpa's Breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motor Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking Motor Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motor Breath was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still like Motor Breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Kajri got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motor Breath 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still running.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a couple nights to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the taste of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donnie Burger was one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Donnie Burger was fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why that didn't get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't get his time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Donnie Burger live rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's fire, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking rosin's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never really impressed with the
flour with the Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, eh, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he'd given me a bag of flour and
he's like, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when people say that they
you're under impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was, I was expecting something else
because I'm like GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to like GMO though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he gave it to me, I was like,
eh, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes living soil, you know,
I think there's a learning curve with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: with how it's grown or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris from Flora and Flame gave me some
rosin and frigging it is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is some of the best rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was judging the Canifest rosin entries
and I use a turp frigging nectar collector
[SPEAKER_00]: for entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually like I can go side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do my little, I first taste them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I line them up in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go, okay, number one versus
number two, number two versus number
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep on going back and forth until
it's down to the order that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I write down all the different
things I like about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I usually try to put them in order
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, his wasn't in the Canifest entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he would have won first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another Donnie Berger entry in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure one of the other ones was
Donnie Berger, but I have some GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went GMO to Donnie Berger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could totally tell the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this amazing, lightly floral
character with this heavy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's one of those ones
that the good rosin just coats your teeth
[SPEAKER_00]: even.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like flossing and you're like,
oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You taste it in your floss that night if
you're taking a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now when you're doing a nectar collector,
are you checking temps or are you just
[SPEAKER_03]: sizzling on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you have a process or a second
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically just heat them up a little bit
because I'm all about the cold start dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, I use my Aris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use my Carta, the Focus V Carta 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can set my temps with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit using the rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a ton of rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't use rigs anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into them a lot this year,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably get back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do like the convenience of a digital
and electronic device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just more convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also training for the hot dabs
podcast, so I had to get my weight out of
[SPEAKER_03]: filming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just dropped to a whole month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a whole month of training to get
ready for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do the hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to train for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would be fucking better if you want
to survive when that shows a game show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking game show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the hot dabs will just wreck me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had so much fun on a fucking
podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a bunch of good podcasts out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Cushman, shout out to Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: First Smoke of the Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all work with Grow World.
[SPEAKER_00]: First Smoke of the Day, you, myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Grow World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we're the guys in the space,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, First Smoke, they're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, First Smoke did it big, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they did it first,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a good head start on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the landscape and made it
possible for us to do what we're doing,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kyle Cushman, he's been doing the
podcast the longest, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been doing it forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he's the strawberry cough guy,
so that's strawberry cough for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot about him on the First
Smoke episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always knew, bro, his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to hear his name in Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky to get him on the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good... That's cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shot back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When our guests talk fast, I talk fast,
and then we get that energy going,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially you start smoking, and then you
just feed off each other's energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like coffee and joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just builds up to something fun,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't mind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just roll a bunch of joints while we're
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll smoke them eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this Four Z's is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you were smoking right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to light that one up
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Lempire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's good friends with Black Sheep Farms,
who was on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tell me about him, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's quite the character.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now a bounty hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing bounty hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fucking way, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's growing and doing his seeds
and everything, but the dude's a bounty
[SPEAKER_00]: hunter, and he's just a character.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the only one that scaled the fence
here to get on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: His phone died, and so he jumped the
fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: He jumped the fucking fence?
[SPEAKER_00]: He jumped the fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a savage, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this guy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He reached out to me, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got a chance to get back to him,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Dylan is an interesting character.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has great stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the real Covolo guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Covolo is an area of Mendocino,
kind of by Ukiah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's from Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's from Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Cali guy, sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he started East Coast,
too, and moved out here with his pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's got some great stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's different than your usual podcast
guest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need that, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how it is, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, I started smoking when I was 12,
and then I got kicked out of school,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I started growing, and I blew up my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been fortunate to get a lot of
women on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first season, I couldn't get women to
save my life, and then I think enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: them saw my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't get enough, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot get enough women on your
podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love having the diversity, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and there's so much more chill,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the girl podcast, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maya from Ohm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's maybe my favorite podcast of the
year, and she smokes hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, you know who I really enjoyed
interviewing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anna from fucking camp.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has the best energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been so calm.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time that comes up, I say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her energy is fucking awesome,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she's chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so chill and cool and really about
it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: She used to be in a delivery service in
New York as a driver in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how fucking shady that was,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was scared to even order for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not ordering.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking delivery service.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to projects and fucking
risk getting robbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to get some weed, then do that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's really from it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so impressed by her story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in the time, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Anna from camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a big girl in sack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a fucking boss, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cranking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a dope ass team.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all happy as fuck to work for her.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really respect and look up to her in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit's dope, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some women out there that
are just crushing it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to drop a podcast with Jasmine,
Adam's wife, from proper doinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you did one with them together,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couples, like a power couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a cool power couple on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the three-person interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the dynamic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to not, but I like it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I was a little nervous about
doing two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like the dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some really good ones with Steve
D'Angelo and Uncle Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tight, tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Steve and First Mon from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've had a bunch of good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had Beanstalk on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, these guys make some killer dry
nutrients that are basically pellets that
[SPEAKER_00]: you time release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of feeding your plants,
you pH your water and you just put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're good for the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll send you some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, where do you put the pellets?
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them in the mix in your substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a top dress?
[SPEAKER_00]: A top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can use them right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beanstalk.
Beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Net from Beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do the dry mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to start using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just came on the show the other day,
so they dropped those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like testing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one of their guests, which was from
Mother's Magnolia in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy squares by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows amazing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard and I can't wait to actually
go up there and see it really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's doing some really cool stuff in
Oregon and he swears by it at his
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's so many different
ways to skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so over being locked into yes or no on
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it good?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like I think the potential
is really there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the concept and, you know,
I like forward thinking people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: like thinking outside the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's how we got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need innovation always, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always the tried and true OG way,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there always will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's always room for innovation,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's these guys that are standing in
their lane and they're perfecting it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the best of their ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the guys, the guys in
lighting, you know, it's like we got
[SPEAKER_00]: Favin, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I feel like Bobby, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes the it makes the industry
better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the grower better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they've they've come up with a
solution that improves the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can do that, if you can make
something that's not just another copycat
[SPEAKER_00]: of something else, you're making something
that actually makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the guys at Favin are crushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough for nothing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to get into cannabis,
if you can figure out a picks and shovels
[SPEAKER_03]: type of business, you're better off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way better off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way better off, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, unless you've been growing for a
long time, you better hire somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: has because there's such a big learning
curve on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even just understanding what
quality means takes a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't really explain it and
show it to somebody in a weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, years, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years.
Dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And developing a palette that not
everybody can even develop a palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's there's, you know,
you got to smoke a lot and you got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to a lot of different flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just be the guy at the distro
that's the buyer and expect to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: palette like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll you'll understand what good weed
smells like, looks like, maybe even feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you won't understand the taste and you
won't understand the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never be able to break it down to
people unless you're a smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have to live for the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you got to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, like just like you said,
there's no other better way to put it,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put in the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to put in the time, bro and beat
them lungs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke proper doinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke proper doinks, kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get them on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, you got to get them on the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had Chris professional joint roller
at Instagram on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who?
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Instagram handle is professional joint
roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like about him is he's kind of
hated by some of these guys because he'll
[SPEAKER_00]: buy the company joints that are like at
the dispensary and then he'll cut them
[SPEAKER_00]: open and you get to look what's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love when people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just sharing how much garbage
there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fucking gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say most of the pre-rolls are just
garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of people doing it
right, but most of them are garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a huge hash hole guy, to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me neither, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at first, but dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd rather smoke good weed and good
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste like shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like after a while, they taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You use good inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have them both good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have flavors that
compliment each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles complements everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like pairing the rosin with the flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're really doing a project,
like from my brand, we'll bring the flour,
[SPEAKER_03]: bring a bunch of different rosins.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my studio, on the top floor,
we got proper joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: We split a studio.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other side of the room is proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you notice, we have the same bricks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got us, you got Blueprint,
you got CGO, you got Bruno Rose,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got Jake Rose, you got Turkey Bag Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole gang is up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you need some rolls, you got three
fucking the best rollers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll roll them up, we'll smoke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I found was after our last
project, we had some rolls for Hashell
[SPEAKER_03]: Island South, CGO and his movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did 1.5 gram flour, half gram rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dog, they were little baseball bats,
but goddamn, it wasn't like the 2.5 with
[SPEAKER_03]: the 5.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't the 2 with the 5.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't the 1.5 with the 0.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a fucking 1.5, 1.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: And goddamn, that was a good roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real good ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real good ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they fucking slapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they drip like crazy, get that white
ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did half skittles and half of these
vanilla beanbelts with forbidden punch or
[SPEAKER_03]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're from a show, Ganja Guru.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should also get on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, great dudes, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And great fucking hashells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like the taste of hashells.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they're just too strong for
me, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of times they're man as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shitty inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shitty inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and if I'm going to smoke anything,
I want it to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's flour or whatever,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I just want it to
be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're old dudes, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have time to smoke a booth,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the perfect joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I really have never talked about it
on the show, but I feel like you'd be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great person to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my perfect is elements paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a 10 millimeter or either
professional or the jumbo organitips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like organitips with the paper filter in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the glass tips as well,
but I really like these organitips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been loving them since they came out
about a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I order them by a hundred and we can go
through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I didn't like the, you know,
there's some glass tips I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first one's Be Real.
[SPEAKER_03]: He dropped the tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funky field tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funky field tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in Amsterdam in 2014 and I saw
them for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, he was on tour with Serial
Killers with Xzibit and Demerick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which those guys are amazing and got to
hang out with those guys in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nuts, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got to see Xzibit learning how
to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew how to roll blunts, but Be Real
was teaching him how to roll joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I witnessed this whole thing at Greenhouse
Coffee Shop and Xzibit talking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, those guys were just super
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, you know, it was really nice
to hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friends, I'm friends with Ariane
and Yoah from Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime you're in Amsterdam,
that's the place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are my boys and they've taken
care of me forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tapped in over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you gone a lot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot, a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a lot of time in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at them kids, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you did, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I spent a lot of time in Barcelona
and a lot of time in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to spend two weeks, a minimum of
two weeks in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I try to get in a couple trips
during the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been able to, because I'm so
focused on the podcast and this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I usually spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Soma, he'd be worth getting a
podcast that's remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be the one guest I would say for
you, because he can't come back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he is an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you ever go to Amsterdam to go meet
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those guys that the one thing
that you need to do when you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam is go meet Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's legendary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to Spanavis and I feel like
everybody goes to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so many good shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've had some great guests from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known Lorenzo for at least since
2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see Lorenzo grew up and he's just,
he's a badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a man, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very generous.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a good spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very genuine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very genuine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, his bro, Lorenzo, I told you this
before, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: His hip hop palette is crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear he grew up with me in Jersey,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an 80s baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think he's an 80s baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe late 80s, but definitely 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Dogg's New York hip hop palette
is fucking impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: He listens to underground shit that I'd be
like, yo, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be tripping if I seen somebody in
California listen to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucks with bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: His love for cannabis, you know,
it supersedes him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like he's, he's been in love with
the plant like a lot of us are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and he really loves the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not here just for the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here because he loves it and he
belongs here and this is where he,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is like where he's at in
his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've known him for 10 years to see
him from one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first met to where he is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of grinding that he's done in
hard work and just passion in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's like, there's a handful
of people I could say I've seen them just
[SPEAKER_00]: really grow up in the industry where 2012
they're exploring and now they're crushing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I met him now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the dude he is now and what he
has established.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been crushing for a long time too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's dope, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: His story was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had like the perfect episode,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was like, it was right before 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he was about to leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I locked in my bro Sabino in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the growing up Italian podcast
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he lets me use the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's Italian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm Italian American.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sabino is Italian as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, bro, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they both had like a best friend in
Italy in common.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is rapper Sfere Basta.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like how we all came together
and like got to do the podcast at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing Up Italian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Studio.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking perfect, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lost his fucking Terps in the taxi.
[SPEAKER_03]: My cousin Anthony fucking hunted the
fucking Uber down, got his Terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking got Lorenzo back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was perfect, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he went home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: World traveler.
[SPEAKER_00]: These Italian guys, I got a handful of
Italian friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my Italian friends, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys crush it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crush on the hash scene, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, weed and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just, they're the real deal
when it comes to passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about passion for the
sake of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys, they're sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it in the hash, on the hash scene,
the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boy's in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend's in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bloom Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ever in Barcelona, Bloom Room,
they got some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbalist in the Bloom Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got, I mean, there's so many places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tap in with you before I go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give me a little route.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all go to dinners together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always dinner parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go with one of them dope ass
dinners I see over there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the food over there is just next
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, every meal is going to be a
good meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only eating twice a day right now,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to eat out, but over in
Barcelona, I don't gain weight when I eat
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, you ever been to Italy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been to Italy for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, you can eat as much pizza as you want
and pasta.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't do anything to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you end up walking and exercise,
but the quality of the food is just way
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quality, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quality of the wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's natural wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sprayed with a bunch of
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not genetically modified to
produce bulk, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's regular ass wheat that we used to
eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lysophates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not putting any of the
glyphophates on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love pizza and I love pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't go wrong with good
Italian food.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cook too, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll whip you a meal sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your favorite pizza?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tough one because like,
all right, so I'm Italian and Sicilian,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, there's different genres,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the Italian side, I'm Napoli Don,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So where it originated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Napoli style pizza I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sicilian style pizza I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Sfincione.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever had Sfincione?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it's kind of like a Sicilian
slice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's thicker, but it just has tomato
sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Romano cheese and breadcrumbs on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got, you know, come on,
a New York, New Jersey slice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't beat that with a bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got a New Jersey or New York,
Sicilian slice that I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I'm going to the spot,
I'm like, yo, let me get a slice of plain,
[SPEAKER_03]: slice of pepperoni.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get that Sicilian joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't give me a side piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give me that corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give me that middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a middle if I have to,
if the cheese ratio is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's my three go-tos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And give me a Coke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even drink Coke like that,
but I need it with my pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you got to have something with the
pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already doing dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just go all the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, you might as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite slice?
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love pizza, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I love making pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends down in Huntington beach,
shout out to RIP Pizzeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RIP beer and pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a beer company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my friend Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do amazing next level pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Detroit is the best, but like his
classic like New York style as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like Tony's in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a place called Capo's.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to ask you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to know about Tony's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put Tony's against some spots on the
East coast, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's a crazy statement,
but bro got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I like Hawaiian pizza
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally down with Hawaiian pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're smoking, where's your
favorite place to go eat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on the vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can fuck up some pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I can fuck up some pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like smash burgers, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on the smash burger kid lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you make them at home too?
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time you come here, the kitchen
will be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make legendary smash burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's cooking and cannabis go
hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not big on infusions, like infusing my
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not my thing, but I love eating
really good food after I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same, same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: From time to time, the edibles hit me way
harder than joints do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way harder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get emotional edibles, I realize,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually only take them on a plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's because where I'm traveling to,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I get all fucking goddamn emotional,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people can eat like 500
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are like 10 milligrams is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sleep on more than 10 milligrams
keeps me awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I smoke a big fat joint,
smoke one of these, I go right to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like 30 to 60 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just eat cozy cues.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I fuck with.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 grams a cue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the rosin gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Rosin Gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin Tech has these rosin gummies that
were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the white thorn rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seen white thorn rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just interviewed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Casale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, totally had him on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did he bring flour for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terps are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rosin is fire too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, the white thorn rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what's crazy about him?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the same last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: My grandfather's name is John Casale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my mother's last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was one of my favorite interviews
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came on with Jason and they did a great
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been making the circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they did first smoke of the day
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they doing first smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think they've already done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it air?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was yours that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we did it as crib.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we dropped the promo reel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to go up there and do it up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did one here with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought the flour and it was really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a great experience having
those guys down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, it's hot though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that being a hot podcast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we timed it right so we weren't
super bacon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was when I wore a black fucking shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my one question that I always ask all
my guests is if you could talk to your
[SPEAKER_00]: younger self and give them one piece of
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that one piece of advice be?
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take more risks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buckle up because she's about to get real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't trust the motherfuckers,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they show you who they are,
believe them immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck second chances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and always before you do a
business, you always ask people how they
[SPEAKER_03]: do business.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've never done business with them
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to do a little background check on
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small enough world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our community is a small enough community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy to background check somebody in this
because somebody did some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, fuck that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's easy to find people that have
worked with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear something online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to somebody that worked with
somebody and get the real truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's only so many people you
can work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody sells weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all work differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only a handful of people with
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffin candy, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffin candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that or the 11 coffins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best thing I smoked
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's definitely the sour diesel
that I got again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you got to try someone gives them
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Dave from Butalero,
we're going to do a drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about doing a drop with the
sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it works well, we're going to
continue to do drops with old school land
[SPEAKER_00]: race, different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like an unknown dude who's who's
really passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I would say he's known
within his community a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he is I think he's ready to come out
and share his story and share his brand
[SPEAKER_00]: with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all he got African black haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Nigerian haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried some.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's similar to Piff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little stronger, though,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of those ones I feel like
when you smoke it, there's certainly it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a creeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these ones are creepers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you smoke it and like it slowly lifts
you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of times you think you're
only going to be so high and you just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: getting more high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I'm not on the podcast doing
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That reminds me of back in the day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, it's creepy when you watch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember like the real good weed would
creep on you sometimes for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like feeling the full
effect, especially when you see big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: bong ramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had like a four foot bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do huge bong ramps out of this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that would get you high right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you smoke some creeper,
you would just keep getting more high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes would get more red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good fucking times, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so if people are looking to find out
more about you, where's the best place to
[SPEAKER_00]: go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a YouTube channel.
