[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to another exciting episode of the
James Loud podcast coming to you straight
[SPEAKER_09]: from the heart of Catalonia, beautiful
Barcelona, a city that pulses with vibrant
[SPEAKER_09]: energy and a zest for life like nowhere
else on earth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thrilled to be here in one of my
favorite cities where the culture is as
[SPEAKER_09]: rich as the history is deep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Barcelona, a city famous for its
breathtaking architecture, from the
[SPEAKER_09]: surreal creations of Gaud√≠ to the medieval
charm of the Gothic Quarter, is more than
[SPEAKER_09]: just a feast for the eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a culinary paradise where every meal
is a celebration, and the flavors are as
[SPEAKER_09]: bold and dynamic as the city itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: From mouth-watering tapas to fresh seafood
that dances on your palate, Barcelona
[SPEAKER_09]: offers a gastronomic adventure that's
second to none.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what better place to host Spannibus,
one of the largest and most celebrated
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis gatherings in Europe?
[SPEAKER_09]: This year marks a bittersweet moment as we
celebrate the final Spannibus event in
[SPEAKER_09]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a significant chapter in cannabis
culture, drawing enthusiasts and experts
[SPEAKER_09]: from across the globe to share,
learn and celebrate the art and science of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: While it's sad to bid farewell to such an
iconic event in this incredible city,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're here to make this last one the most
memorable yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Join us as we explore the vibrant culture,
dive into the delectable food,
[SPEAKER_09]: and experience the amazing cannabis scene
that Barcelona is renowned for.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll live it up one last time at
Spannibus, soaking in every moment of this
[SPEAKER_09]: unique gathering.
[SPEAKER_09]: First up is the Barcelona Dabidu,
a very special event which is a kickoff to
[SPEAKER_09]: the week of Spannibus and also to
celebrate Mila's 80th birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here kicking off Spannibus 2025 at the
Greenhouse slash Strain Hunters Club in
[SPEAKER_11]: Barcelona with Arien Roskam.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing today, Arien?
[SPEAKER_25]: We're doing great, guys.
[SPEAKER_25]: And James Loud, guys.
[SPEAKER_25]: This weekend, Spannibus at the Greenhouse
booth.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I hope to see you all there and have a
great weekend in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with Dr. Green from Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was in a Strain Hunters documentary in
2000.
[SPEAKER_11]: 2011 or 2012?
[SPEAKER_23]: 2011, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we met at the High Times Cannabis Cup
in 2012.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we got Ashwin here.
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know James for many, many years now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sold your seats.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seat center over the counter.
[SPEAKER_14]: But most remarkable, something I will
never forget, is when Sunset Sherp first
[SPEAKER_14]: landed here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was one man that took it to
Spannibus and people were lining up for
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's... How we got here,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I had it at Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_14]: You had your hands on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We did.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.
[SPEAKER_14]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Game changer.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's because of the flavor,
the flavor profile, something unique.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it lingers in my memory.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like the flavors from today that
people know as gelatos and all these
[SPEAKER_11]: gelato derivatives all really started with
Sunset Sherp.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was cookies and they're all
derivatives of cookies, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, that Sunset Sherp,
kind of set the trend on that candy
[SPEAKER_11]: dessert profile.
[SPEAKER_14]: And sure, that Sunset Sherp had power.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was special.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I think is also important.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like flavor, effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Something that, like when you smoke,
you know that you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nowadays, everything is flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can empty bags after bags.
[SPEAKER_11]: When there's so much similarity between
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sunset Sherp back then really stood
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very special.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario did a good job growing that,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got to give it up to Mario for growing
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Scherbinski, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_14]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out Scherbinski.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there was people that started seed
companies off of the bag seeds that came
[SPEAKER_14]: out of the Scherber packs.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that people called it even
Spannibus Scherberg.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fino Finder has a Spannibus Sherp in
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_14]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He crushed it with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's great seeing you here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you expecting out of Spannibus
2025?
[SPEAKER_18]: As the last Spannibus we understand in
Barcelona, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm sad, to be honest with you,
because as you know, most of us are here
[SPEAKER_18]: the last decade, at least, at least 10
years with clubs that we are accustomed
[SPEAKER_18]: to, people who are accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_18]: We were both here when they opened this
club up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, 2014.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have our places already and to see
the expo move and go to somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_18]: because a lot of people are saying,
oh, it's going to stay the same.
[SPEAKER_18]: People are going to come.
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's not true.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can't sell, sorry, if you can't
market your brand, in Spannibus coming
[SPEAKER_18]: from America, coming from the UK and all
that, are you really going to come to
[SPEAKER_18]: Barcelona in March just to hang out with,
how many friends are actually going to be
[SPEAKER_18]: here?
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's sad.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's sad for me that things are changing
and hopefully, you know, we'll all find a
[SPEAKER_18]: new location that's similar enough to be
together.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe the Caribbean, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely Mary Jane too, but it's not
just once a year.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to get together multiple times a
year.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can't just be once a year.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: So like we need our Spannibus type event
right around this time of year.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need the Mary Jane type event.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need the Caribbean events.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need the California events where people
are coming to California to the events,
I think.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, if the right people are
listening, I mean, you know, every show
[SPEAKER_18]: has its audience.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: But if this show eventually maybe does get
to the political aspect of Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_18]: the mayor especially, I mean, look,
Spain has a ton of money as a country,
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe from the old slave trade days.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, but it's still, why would
you as a country discourage tourism that
[SPEAKER_18]: is not affecting anyone that is taking
away from illicit market opportunities?
[SPEAKER_18]: And we know that when, when cannabis is
sold on the street, the monies from those
[SPEAKER_18]: illicit activities go to more illicit
activities, firearms and all these other
[SPEAKER_18]: issues.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you have a licensed operation that,
I mean, you look around through the video
[SPEAKER_18]: here, you see it's a social club.
[SPEAKER_18]: People come here to consume.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cannabis peacefully.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then leave peacefully.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one of the greatest things you could
do.
[SPEAKER_18]: If anyone hears this, the thousands of
people that come here every year for the
[SPEAKER_18]: purpose of consuming in the clubs,
it should be something to be considered to
[SPEAKER_18]: be kept.
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, it's hard to argue that this
planet doesn't make the world a better
[SPEAKER_11]: place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So at the end of the day, I feel like the
people here are bringing positivity into
[SPEAKER_11]: this world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're, you know, whether they're
consciously doing it or not, they're
[SPEAKER_11]: making the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's my big argument for all
these types of events.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think sharing our stories and
experiences coming to these events
[SPEAKER_11]: together.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we've been doing this for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was, it's almost a little bit 10 years
now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: 13 years together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then besides what we've done on our
own, it was like, you know, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_18]: without these events, we would never have
met.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have more good friends out here than I
do in my own country.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, so it's, it's something that,
it's something that should be encouraged.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this, the social aspect of it,
the coming together, one small event
[SPEAKER_18]: sometimes brings 20, 30 countries
together.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, so Spannabis brings definitely a
lot more, you know, as a whole.
[SPEAKER_11]: It brings money into the economy in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the people here, they're,
they're not out to hurt people.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not out to rip people off.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not out to do bad things.
[SPEAKER_18]: For the most part, they're really good,
good people.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the most important thing for the
government to understand is that,
[SPEAKER_18]: because you know, I come from a regulatory
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to put it in, it's that without the
clubs, without the social club system,
[SPEAKER_18]: even if you put it into pharmacies,
you're going to encourage and increase the
[SPEAKER_18]: illicit market, which will encourage more
problems in the end.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the best thing to do is to license,
legitimate, legitimize, and regulate more
[SPEAKER_18]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_18]: Simply.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's the best thing that they
could do here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Personally.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, everywhere, France also,
you know, most of the European countries.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do this again this week.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to get busy.
[SPEAKER_18]: So.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here with Lance from Grove.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing today, Lance?
[SPEAKER_05]: I am doing well, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always good to see you around the
world as always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always good to see you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We bump into each other everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be bumping into each other
more this year at several events,
[SPEAKER_11]: including Germany.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are here for the last span of us
today.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the puff puff primordial,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that puff puff international
primordial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of the whole start of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the birthing of the start of
spandibus.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, we've been doing this for
years, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works up and it only gets better
day after day after day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we figured we'd be a part of the big
bang before the official start tomorrow on
[SPEAKER_05]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have some amazing food.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of amazing guests at this
event.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really looking forward to span of us
this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you know, they're saying it's the
last span of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, this it's bittersweet because this
is my eighth year, I want to say sans
[SPEAKER_05]: covid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So doing it for a decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, spandibus is a part of
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you and I both know like we come out
being California kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're used to this weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're used to this vibe.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to experience it in the other side of
the world is always special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the fact that they're saying
they're going to take it to Bilbao,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I get they're finally they've been
talking about destroying the fairgrounds
[SPEAKER_05]: for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're taking it to Bilbao,
but it doesn't have the same energy as
[SPEAKER_05]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have the clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a couple of clubs versus two or
three hundred.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're saying they're taking it to
Bilbao, but they've been doing it in
[SPEAKER_11]: Bilbao.
[SPEAKER_11]: They did last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: They did it in Bilbao for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think on and off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: On and off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did bring it back last year
before they did Madrid and that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I bittersweet feelings.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's like I've loved spandibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my single favorite event to go to
every year.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have friends that I only see at
spandibus and I hope I'll see them at Mary
[SPEAKER_11]: Jane as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like such an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I mean, one of the best interviews I
ever did was in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I both, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had an amazing, amazing interview that
no one will ever get to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they'll get to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could see it, but they'd never hear
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't record the sound.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm excited for the next three
days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm too, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And talking to some friends that are local
coffee shop owners, Stefan for pretty me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Lorenzo from Terps Army Screech
from Dank of England.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all talking about getting together
as the coffee shops and doing a weed week
[SPEAKER_05]: out here next year, regardless.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm feeling guys like you and I will
still roll up for that because to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to do all this and not have to go work a
fair for three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it sounds a little more intimate.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like when the big band goes and plays
all the small clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking forward to it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking forward to hanging with you this
week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with Sebastian from 420 Fast
Buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how are you?
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you feeling about this being the
last spannibus?
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not the last spannibus, just the last
spannibus in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_11]: But last in Lofira for sure because
they're tearing it down, right?
[SPEAKER_24]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_24]: They're tearing down the whole
fairgrounds, which is sad because I feel
[SPEAKER_24]: like this pyramid, maybe it's not the most
modern anymore and people need something
[SPEAKER_24]: more modern, but it's iconic.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has people with tattoos of the pyramid
on their backs.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing event place.
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as an event center, someplace where
we've been going for a long time to these
[SPEAKER_11]: events, I love the venue, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And every year I love the fact that you
can go to the same place and find the same
[SPEAKER_11]: people, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Greenhouse is in the same place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people are in the same place they've
been for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're always the same.
[SPEAKER_24]: We're always 196.
[SPEAKER_24]: You come in first, it's first booth on the
left.
[SPEAKER_24]: So let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to be one of those people who
are like, oh, the end of an era.
[SPEAKER_24]: It is the end of an era, but is there
something new coming?
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course there's something new coming.
[SPEAKER_24]: Is Spannabis Bilbao, which is going to
be... They've been doing it in Bilbao
[SPEAKER_24]: though every year too.
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's 17th, 18th and 19th of April.
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have to check it out and I need to
throw a 420 event the next day.
[SPEAKER_24]: So after everything is over, of course
somebody needs to do it.
[SPEAKER_24]: And if not me, who can do it?
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_24]: But I go without any... Let's check it
out.
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it going to replace Spannabis?
[SPEAKER_24]: It can't.
[SPEAKER_24]: It can't replace here.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's 20 years of coming.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a huge scene here.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a beautiful city.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I give Bilbao the chance, but it won't
have the infrastructure to hold 50,000
[SPEAKER_24]: people, you know, like that, not host them
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Germany, what they're going to...
They're expecting 100,000 people in
[SPEAKER_11]: Germany this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_24]: Last year was cool.
[SPEAKER_24]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_24]: But a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_24]: The organization of the fair was a
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_24]: There was trash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like nothing was working.
[SPEAKER_24]: This year they're organizing it double the
size.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm sure they're prepared.
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody learns from their mistakes.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I am excited for this very much.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that eventually Berlin is
going to take the place of Spannabis in
[SPEAKER_24]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we will have events like Spannabis
Bilbao, which will be amazing,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it won't be... It will be as impactful
as Spannabis Barcelona, but it's still
[SPEAKER_11]: will have impact.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's still people I know that go to
Bilbao every year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I mean, I'm really excited for
the next three days.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be really fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be really busy.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I love this.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in our element here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we love.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_24]: I come home at one, two o'clock in the
morning and I get up or I leave the house
[SPEAKER_24]: before 10.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is day after day after day after day.
[SPEAKER_24]: Your body sometimes just screams rest when
you come home, but you always want more.
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I maybe add one more club?
[SPEAKER_24]: Just one more dab?
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I do this more?
[SPEAKER_24]: It's as you say, we're just fully in our
element.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what we live for.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be wild.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be wild.
[SPEAKER_24]: Man, thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for everything, man.
[SPEAKER_24]: Always, always.
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: I always have to say at the end,
no?
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to remember that it's 4.20
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with Dan Herrer.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brother, I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, thank you so much for giving me some
time carrying the legacy on of the late
[SPEAKER_11]: Jack that's impacted so many of us on so
many levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here in Spain and I see the things
that he helped to start and inspire here
[SPEAKER_02]: just as he did in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get to feel his energy everywhere I
go.
[SPEAKER_11]: His legacy lives on.
[SPEAKER_11]: His impact was so great it's felt
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legacy, by the way, is not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legacy is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jack's son, but this is the legacy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so much greater.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's like the Grateful Dead,
how they've impacted our whole industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jack is on that same level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from the cannabis standpoint,
he's one of the very few people I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that has truly changed the world by being
as powerful and passionate and outspoken
[SPEAKER_02]: and unrelenting and authentic and
unapologetic and unapologetic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell me about everything that you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard you're doing all kinds of wild
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're looking to bust into the
European market in multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, cannabis is a tough development
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Jack brand is more than just what
people look at a genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everything from clothing to wine
to beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a Jack Harrow wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a German wine made from a Dutch
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an alcohol wine with Jack Harrow
terpenes with our partnered terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: company, Abshox Tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know Abshox Tech very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're also partnering here with a
brewery called Gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gross Beer is doing a Jack Harrow
beer, which will be launching next month.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys are putting Jack Terps in the
beer and Jack Terps in the wine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we wanted to create
something that was truly shareable,
[SPEAKER_02]: like people would want to sit down and
have the beer with their food and sit down
[SPEAKER_02]: with a mate or a date and truly enjoy a
glass of wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's not something that you want to
sit down and share, we weren't interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in making a novelty product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to make something that that
really did more than collect dust on a
[SPEAKER_02]: mantle somewhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think that authenticity
resonates so heavily within our community,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially it's just so important to have
something that we all enjoy that you can
[SPEAKER_11]: give to somebody and they want to use.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, cannabis is supposed to be used
fresh, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hash is hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can smoke years later.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blower, on the other hand, does not smoke
good years later.
[SPEAKER_11]: Typically, typically.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are some good there's some
people that have figured out how to store
[SPEAKER_02]: it well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can preserve it for months,
not years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, who knows?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think that they depending on
what you like, I think the terpenes change
[SPEAKER_11]: over time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Frenchy cannoli.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always talked about how terpenes change
over time, you know, within the hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so he was a smart man.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a smart man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another guy that just really contributed
heavily to the community level of culture
[SPEAKER_02]: within.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash culture, the hash world benefited
by his absolute dedication to just his
[SPEAKER_11]: devotion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And same thing with Jack.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like these people are so devotional.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the guys that I look up to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're doing some great things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think being the second generation and
being the legacy, I think you're doing a
[SPEAKER_11]: great job.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like expanding into these other
markets where you can introduce terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: into alcoholic beverages is amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, being a chef and having a
background in culinary arts, I have a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of respect for people that are trying to
branch off and to do things that aren't
[SPEAKER_11]: being done.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody can copy somebody else,
but to pave the way and try to go into
[SPEAKER_11]: other stuff, not knowing if it's going to
work, but having a gut feeling,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's that devotional quality, you know,
that makes the world great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm expecting pushback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get pushed back,
but fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is, is if something's
good, then it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's good food, it's good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's good wine, it's good wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's good beer, same.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't segment between alcohol and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you go to most any cannabis
events, there is alcohol and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only the government that tries to
keep everything separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but we know what brings people
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this plant in this community is
perfect for pairing a wine with a hash or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a dab or a joint and then being
able to experience a plethora of,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: Experiences.
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of the day, these are
experiences.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you can give somebody experience
that they wouldn't otherwise get from
[SPEAKER_11]: somewhere else, you're onto something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping that we're going to be there
for the long run and that people will give
[SPEAKER_02]: it an opportunity because it is different
when you get the notes of cannabis in your
[SPEAKER_02]: wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of messes with you for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you, you give it a chance,
you taste it and you realize that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Laganitas, I used to work for
Laganitas, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, I was a chef for Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a music festival, beer festival,
music festival.
[SPEAKER_11]: They combined it called the beer circus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, Laganitas had a terpene beer.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were the first ones, I believe they
worked with Absolute Extracts,
[SPEAKER_11]: not Absolute Tech, but Absolute Extracts
and they released it and they got letters
[SPEAKER_11]: from the DEA cease and desist and all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we did a beer collaboration with
Sweetwater Brewing in 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They produced 10,000 cases of Jack terpene
beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold it in about 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were bought by a Canadian
company and a Canadian company cut off all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cannabis branded or licensed beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the flip side, the beer was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they would bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, moving forward,
here we are in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with a great brewery,
Brewery Grosbeer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to coming back here
next month and launching.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm really looking forward
to in the weed world is people crossing
[SPEAKER_11]: Jack Herrera again, bringing back some of
those old Jack crosses, the Jack Flash,
[SPEAKER_11]: the Jack Frost, you know, the Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's versions of it out there that are
good, really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: But back in the 90s, in early 2000s,
there was a lot of variation with Jack.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was so many people breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were getting all kinds of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would love if the world came back
with the Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do our own crosses, but we're
really focusing on new standalone genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that are specific to our brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really hoping that expanding the
options for Jack pre-rolls, infused
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-rolls, the multiple different flavors
and products that we have through the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower side of things, that people will
understand that the brand is more than
[SPEAKER_02]: just the single genetic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and it almost has to be because the
thing with Jack is it's so dominant.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you cross it to other stuff,
a lot of times you get Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, everything becomes Jack
and Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, oh, yeah,
that's Jackie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, and we want we want
people to enjoy Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also want people to just enjoy Jack
anodist and something unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully they can find that with some
of the things that we're developing with
[SPEAKER_02]: the brand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you guys are interested in Fino's
and Fino hunting, we're doing that all the
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd love to have you up at the
facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come by, check out the stuff, do a
tasting.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can sit down and have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do a pairing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I'm doing a new food show where
we're doing a weed and food pairings.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd love to have you on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll send a case.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm super down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many blessings, brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yo, what's poppin, y'all?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's your boy J Rocker.
[SPEAKER_19]: We out here at the Hash Calabash 2025.
[SPEAKER_19]: Barcelona, Spain.
[SPEAKER_19]: You already know what it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: We out here celebrating hashish,
cannabis, sativa in the name of the late
[SPEAKER_19]: great Frenchy Canole.
[SPEAKER_19]: So give thanks, yo, for Frenchy and all
the teachings passed on to the hashishians
[SPEAKER_19]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we out here united in the name of a
legend.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're having a great time breaking
bread.
[SPEAKER_19]: Checking out turps from all over the
world, international.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got 20 different countries in the house
with us tonight.
[SPEAKER_19]: So people brought out turps from Canada,
from the States, all across Europe,
[SPEAKER_19]: Africa, and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: We love y'all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank y'all for coming out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank y'all for showing love.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here at the Hash Calabash.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with the cannabis brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys just flew in.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fucking better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we just got here, because I need
a fucking dab, dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flame ride was rough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're here and it's our first time and
we're fucking excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great that you guys finally made
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last time, the only thing that showed up
were the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, were the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: This time we brought some seeds and we got
some special shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We brought some El Cucuy for spandibus.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's going to be a really amazing
event.
[SPEAKER_11]: They say it's the last one in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you guys feel about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad we made it because it's our first
time here.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least we made this last one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be epic, especially for me
and my bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be really epic for our
friends, the brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys just blew up again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the second time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's good to be back with all our
original friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Olympics, dude, was really amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your booth was crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally, every time I walk by,
there's a line at your booth for people
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to get flowered.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it was dope.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was dope.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every year, I host a dinner at my favorite
restaurant in Barcelona, El Pasadiz del
[SPEAKER_09]: Pep.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always great to share an incredible
meal with my closest friends.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_23]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Barcelona.
Day one,
[SPEAKER_11]: spandibus 2025.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here at the greenhouse booth 56.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, it's a bittersweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying it's the last spandibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been raining.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure how the attendance was going
to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got people coming in in droves,
lots of happy people, lots of excited
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_11]: The energy here is alive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody from the States is coming here.
[SPEAKER_11]: There hasn't been a spandibus before.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm blown away by how many people are
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here with the legendary Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you doing, Adam?
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm great, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: Staying high in Barcelona, smoking weed,
chilling out.
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been coming to events for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been seeing you at High Times
Cannabis Cup 2012, the old school High
[SPEAKER_11]: Times Cannabis, the very first American
cups.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were in all of those.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were a good time.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a different time than what it is
right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a lot more taboo back then and a
little bit more still secretive.
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's so good to be in an international
city where I'm smoking weed from
[SPEAKER_21]: Switzerland and Finland and Germany and
Spain, all sorts of different countries.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, Morocco.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had some stuff from Iran, a guy from
Iran.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a breeder from Iran here too.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_11]: That guy has balls, dude, to be able to
pull that kind of stuff off.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_21]: But we've been doing this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's good to see you still out here making
it happen.
[SPEAKER_21]: And just love to see the evolution of
cannabis in the whole event space.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fighting the good fight, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing it, just making it normal,
just normalizing it, changing the tone.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what needs to happen, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Smoke more weed.
[SPEAKER_21]: And shout out to all the growers too.
[SPEAKER_21]: Please keep growing great weed so we can
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here at Spanimous 2025 with Rob
from... Pacific Rim Fusion.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been from a lot of things over the
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: We go way back.
[SPEAKER_11]: We go back to before cookies was even
cookies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put it on the map.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're out here at Spanimous 2025.
[SPEAKER_12]: Feels like California 2015.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fucking loving it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So is this your first Spanimous?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my very first Spanimous.
[SPEAKER_12]: Took me a long time to get out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were supposed to come out here in 2019,
then COVID hit and ruined the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So put a little damper, but I made sure to
make it out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank God I did since this is the last one
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's bittersweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me some of the highlights of your
trip.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, being in the industry as long as you
and I have, we've seen this, but we
[SPEAKER_12]: haven't seen it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: This feels like California 2015 to me,
which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, this feels like 2010.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always had that early high times vibe
where we had these cups and it was very...
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nostalgic for me because everyone was
so passionate about weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't bitter about the industry
yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't jaded.
[SPEAKER_11]: These people walking around here love
weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: They love everything about the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: They get excited about edibles still.
[SPEAKER_11]: They get excited about brownies,
the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not even good hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just get excited about hash,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an incredible... It's still about the
love of the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: It hasn't been ruined yet by...
[SPEAKER_11]: By big business or corporations or just
the evolution of where it's going to go to
[SPEAKER_11]: legalize it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: The people that don't make it,
the big guys start taking over.
[SPEAKER_12]: The little guys follow the wayside.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but out here, the vibe's big,
it's strong.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't believe it took me this long to
get here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe it took you this long
either.
[SPEAKER_11]: Glad you're here though, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell me about your new venture.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I recently joined a company
called Pacific Room Fusion.
[SPEAKER_12]: About eight months ago, they brought me on
as a consultant to help them build out the
[SPEAKER_12]: user interface.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our new platform.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then both of us kind of gained more
and more interest in the other person or
[SPEAKER_12]: the other group.
[SPEAKER_12]: And long story short, we're a few weeks
away from launch and it's essentially kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of a B2B weed maps or an eBay for cannabis
and hemp CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's worldwide, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So North America, Western Europe,
Southeast Asia, South America,
[SPEAKER_12]: any hemp producing country, businesses can
get online, kind of post a whole eBay type
[SPEAKER_12]: listing for bulk products.
[SPEAKER_12]: So whether that's seeds, whether that's
hemp, whether that's biomass, isolate,
[SPEAKER_12]: flour, or whatever, it's an international
marketplace for people to communicate with
[SPEAKER_12]: each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in regulated areas, say like
within the States, regulated companies can
[SPEAKER_12]: meet each other on there as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nifty little ideas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty novel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, thank you so much for your time,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to having you on the
podcast again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would love that, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with Dave C from the Adam Dunn
Show.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: How's your span of this going?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're loving it.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a great event.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a little sad that it's the last one in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see how Bilbao goes next year.
[SPEAKER_22]: It might not have the infrastructure yet,
but they have a year to prepare for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are some of the highlights of your
trip?
[SPEAKER_22]: I love catching up with old friends that
don't come over to the States for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_22]: Ghana events.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was hoping there would be more
technology here.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, to sort of focus on the European
market.
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is a breeder heavy event.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, a real breeder heavy event.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seed producer maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a handful of breeders and a lot of
people making seeds these days.
[SPEAKER_22]: There are chuckers out here.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, they are just throwing anything
forward.
[SPEAKER_22]: But there are a lot of people selling
genetics.
[SPEAKER_22]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a shit ton of seeds in the
building.
[SPEAKER_22]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_22]: Had a great time here.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm looking forward to next year.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to see more of Spain.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see more of you.
[SPEAKER_22]: You got to come out to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_22]: I need a host, a co-host.
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you trying to recruit me on camera?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm recruiting him on camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just offered Dave double the salary.
[SPEAKER_22]: Double.
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy shit.
Double.
[SPEAKER_22]: Zero times zero is zero.
[SPEAKER_22]: Why don't you go four times?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, four times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Zero times zero times four is still zero.
[SPEAKER_22]: Adam, step your game.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, maybe he'll sign a big contract,
write it for me.
[SPEAKER_22]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a great co-host, Adam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: If it wasn't for you, I probably wouldn't
be here.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: I still remember scooping out a several
hundred dollars of rosin from your jar.
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_22]: I still remember it too.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_22]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_22]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're making loud noise and smoking loud
weed on the James loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful day to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful day to buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful day to be alive and to be
involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, we are on location with Mendo Dope.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could it get any louder in here?
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're doing so good right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is epic to be out here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Super fun time.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are stoned.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the place to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The smoke is in the air.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's six o'clock on a Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still packed.
[SPEAKER_11]: This place is packed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you roll it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got some CBDs rolled up in the blunt
because we've been smoking so much good
[SPEAKER_15]: stuff while we've been out here that we
haven't smoked any CBDs yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is Flow Gardens.
[SPEAKER_11]: Flow Garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got one CBD at Spannibus, third place
last night.
[SPEAKER_15]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_15]: Third place.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's even more such a big treat for us
to be able to enjoy some of the top
[SPEAKER_15]: contenders.
[SPEAKER_11]: Top tier CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder what the first place looked like
because I'm impressed on this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's rigged though.
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_15]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always rigged.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how's Spannibus treating you?
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys first year out here?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this is our first time out in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_15]: First time at Spannibus and it's been like
amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just crazy all around from the
views of everything, the food,
[SPEAKER_15]: the people.
[SPEAKER_15]: Being out here at Spannibus to enjoy it in
Barcelona before it changes makes it so
[SPEAKER_15]: special to us.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are out here performing too.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a hash calabash.
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we must have left right before you
guys came up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw a picture this morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, you were there on the couch
where we were.
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know you were there.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that event was great.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a cool little event.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So being able to perform out here on the
main stage, totally unexpected,
[SPEAKER_15]: snuck on there and got to do two songs,
which one of them was a dedication to
[SPEAKER_15]: Frenchy Canole.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's coming up on a new album.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Ooh La La.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was just so awesome to see the
whole crowd vibing with us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a good crowd here.
[SPEAKER_11]: The people are so passionate.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, not just the Spanish people,
everyone from all around the world,
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone is loving it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just good vibes, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Pure vibes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good vibes, good weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I first came to my first
Spannibus, the weed sucked.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was like Don and Aaron had good
weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a handful of people with really
good weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long ago was that?
[SPEAKER_11]: 2012 to 2013.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was my first year.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've been to a lot of Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this event.
[SPEAKER_16]: Major evolution.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the extra game out here, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Skittles rising out here has been next
level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So with the water and the climate that
different regions have in the world is so
[SPEAKER_16]: cool to see strains that we've kind of got
to know, especially in Cali or even in our
[SPEAKER_16]: own county of Mendocino or the Bay Area
grown.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then to see some of this grown in
Spain and see what turps it kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: expressions brings out from this climate.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the water has a lot to do
besides this climate these days.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: The water that you feed in it can change
the flavor also and bring in the vibe from
[SPEAKER_16]: wherever your region is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, most of us have such chemically
treated water in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_16]: So places like this make sense.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the hash makes sense because once
you're using a lot more water and you're
[SPEAKER_16]: cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's very awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very delicious.
[SPEAKER_15]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like super bomb.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so smooth, too.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like just on the inhale, exhale,
nothing but just smoothness.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can feel it's like instant calming,
almost relaxing me already.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: 19% CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to have like 4% turps.
[SPEAKER_11]: That stuff is wild.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not look like CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can smoke that whole thing down
and you're just going to be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll feel the tobacco more than you'll
feel the weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, for sure.
Yummy.
[SPEAKER_15]: So how's it been for you out here,
though?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you've been rocking at this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this event.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the people here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a lot of people that watch the
podcast from all over the world that have
[SPEAKER_11]: come up and wanted to take photos and want
to hang out and smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a lot of gifts from people.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I was younger, I won a cup in 2012
in Amsterdam and I saw people come up to
[SPEAKER_11]: Soma and gift him stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was guys crying when they gave Soma
stuff, like literally crying when they
[SPEAKER_11]: were giving Soma stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to just get a lot of getting positive
feedback from fans, we have a lot of good
[SPEAKER_11]: people out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like my podcast isn't really
just me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about the guest.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just great acknowledgement when
it's like they're telling me I'm doing
[SPEAKER_11]: something good.
[SPEAKER_15]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can totally dig that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been so cool to be like this far from
home for our first trip out to Europe,
[SPEAKER_15]: out to Spain and like to see how much love
and from people from all over the place
[SPEAKER_15]: coming up to say what's up and how long
they've been following us.
[SPEAKER_15]: For the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are crushing, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have been doing it a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's so dope how so many people have
been like real hardcore supporters of us
[SPEAKER_15]: from the beginning and still here with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's an evolution of what you guys
did.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's spread out across the globe.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing when you throw a pebble in a
pond and create those waves, dude,
[SPEAKER_11]: and how they fucking just take their own
shape.
[SPEAKER_11]: In a sense, we're all in evolution from
the Grateful Dead here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you guys from the Grateful Dead
and you guys into all these other little
[SPEAKER_11]: projects that people have done and bands.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just it's a vibe,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a total vibe.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we represent and support.
[SPEAKER_15]: And fuck James Loud, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's our homie right here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Real deal, serious, real deal breeder,
you know, passionate about this culture,
[SPEAKER_15]: someone who really knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And like this is the kind of people that
we need on the on the front line,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, standing on our ground with real
ganja soldiers out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're doing it together.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're about the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: All about all about all of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all stronger together.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our roots combine and we're building an
unbreakable foundation out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and so many of us see ourselves as
individuals, but I love looking at the
[SPEAKER_11]: community as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're trying to just master our
craft, go out there and spread this
[SPEAKER_15]: culture and just have fun with it,
too.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the game is hard right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of people getting taken out
of the game and big corporations coming
[SPEAKER_15]: in.
[SPEAKER_15]: But with people like James Loud,
people like us and these other companies
[SPEAKER_15]: that are holding it down for real,
like this culture will.
[SPEAKER_15]: It will prevail.
[SPEAKER_11]: It will prevail through the collaboration
model, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the collaboration model,
we can all work together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a it's a worldwide collaboration now
is what's really cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing this really opens my eyes to what's
been happening and what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_16]: happening in this moment, too.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just like a lot of really cool
worldwide possibilities for us to come
[SPEAKER_16]: together, not just as a community or a
county or a state or a country,
[SPEAKER_16]: but a world.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's great.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're taking it back over because we're
still blown away.
[SPEAKER_16]: They took it from us all these years ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: How did the world go hate the plant all at
once?
[SPEAKER_16]: Such a money driven scandal.
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're turning the tables finally.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're talking about a plant that for
thousands and thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_11]: we used it as medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all of a sudden it's gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then and then the people forget.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy to forget.
[SPEAKER_11]: We weren't raised with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're like, oh, it must be bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're told it's bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: The stigma of it stays with people way
longer than I somehow understand.
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's that stigma, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still there slowly, but surely
because people our age, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: The next generation has changed after our
kids.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we got donors like us smoking hard
and people seeing it and we're productive
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, productive Americans.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing our jobs.
[SPEAKER_15]: We smoke tough, but we get the job done
for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you guys so much for taking
the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to James Loud.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't do you guys killing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Kaka.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much love, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm at Spannibus 2025 with Eric from Flow
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_11]: He just won third place last night for
CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, Eric?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing good, James.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for having me out, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations on the big win.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a big deal going home with
hardware.
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you guys that don't know,
it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spannibus is one of the biggest festivals
in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to go home with hardware your first
time is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually a dream of mine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very proud of mine and it's never
happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good job.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I won High Time Skin of His
Cups.
[SPEAKER_11]: I won other stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the last one, so I won't be
getting a Spannibus piece of hardware in
[SPEAKER_11]: my life, at least unless they have another
one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I entered your flower hoping that
would win.
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't take the place, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, Indica is a tough category,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, there's a lot of good flower coming
in for the entry, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, THCA.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are crushing the THCA.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was just smoking your flower with
Mendo Dope.
[SPEAKER_11]: The applesauce, the fucking high level
seed, that's high CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was taking big hits out of a blunt.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the funny thing is, I felt the tobacco
more than I felt the weed in a good way.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can smoke a whole big freaking
joint of it and you just feel amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it satiates you in the same way that
like, well, I'm not in the same way a
[SPEAKER_11]: non-alcoholic beer does, but like it
satiates you in a way where if you like
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking, but you don't want the effect,
you don't want tight eyes, you don't want
[SPEAKER_11]: to be tired.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great alternative.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It gives you a good head change and it
lasts for like 30 minutes, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you so much for taking the
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for having me, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_11]: Day three.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with Kelly from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super nice to see you today,
James.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a year since we saw each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great debate last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love when people could talk about stuff
openly and debate stuff and just you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and have a difference of opinion
sometimes, but still be able to talk about
[SPEAKER_11]: it in a nice, sensible way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel like if there's respect for
one another and there's true respect for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, then it's really easy to find
that common ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think at the end of the day,
we're all here because of a plant,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that changes the world,
something that makes the world a better
[SPEAKER_11]: place, something that makes us smile when
we talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really can feel that energy and
vibration here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the people that you meet from
all over the world, there's multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: different languages, all different kinds
of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the vibration is super high
because cannabis just keeps us at that
[SPEAKER_01]: high vibration.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are some of the highlights of your
trip so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really we did a whole bunch of club
reviews this year, and that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning, we just thought,
oh, we'll just sort of mess around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it turns out that not a lot of
people have done club reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt like so welcome and like family
at every single club that we went into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to review them and really highlight
them and put them out into the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say that was one of my highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's such a I mean, they're saying
it's the last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's kind of sad if it's going
to be the last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: But everything evolves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's never the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's Berlin.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's other things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this city, though.
[SPEAKER_11]: This city is so special.
[SPEAKER_01]: This city is really special, especially to
walk around at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of our events are late
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that quiet time where nobody's
out in the streets and you can really feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like the ancient city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I know that a lot of the other
cannabis people are walking around because
[SPEAKER_01]: we see them late at night, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty magical.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's so much energy and so much
history here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like from one place in one area,
the next there's different energies.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the Gothic Quarter has its own
like strange energy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it can be kind of dark.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_11]: You look at some of the architecture and
it's kind of dark, some of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, you go into the born
and it's I love I love.
[SPEAKER_11]: Born is like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The born district is one of my favorites
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you add a little bit
of micro dosing or even some macro dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things are really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes alive in a whole different way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Montserrat.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys haven't been Montserrat,
we have.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know energy there is so next level.
[SPEAKER_11]: So next level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's like energy swirling out
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And unless you see it, you would never
understand what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe you would.
[SPEAKER_11]: You would.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I love Montserrat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to really see that Madonna and then
how it's recreated with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the baby Jesus or whatever that vision is
and the fact that it's in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mystery is really elusive and
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's amazing that they hiked up into
the mountains and carved this out of the
[SPEAKER_11]: mountainside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did they?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or did they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did they?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many big questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm really, really more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk around this city and I question our
history and like, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't really make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this doesn't make sense,
but that's the mystery and the beauty of
[SPEAKER_01]: it all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, are you going to be in Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to be in Germany for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be there for probably ICBC as well
as Mary Jane and maybe even having a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a base there for a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really looking forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never been to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed last year, but I can't wait to go
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see you there for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much, James, for everything that
you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're coming on the podcast in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody, she's on the podcast in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_11]: She said it here first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, James.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with the Aladdin, Khalifa
Genetics, Spannabis 2025.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very good, James.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: And how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really great having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to do another, we need to do a
real podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to have you in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: It'd be an honor.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you are the exclusive, so far the
exclusive guy with the books in Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you need the breeding book,
you're the guy to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get it on khalifagenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently we're the only ones in Europe.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys have been selling through
books, which is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great for the community.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the feedback on those books is great.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people that order from Germany
mostly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people from France as well and Spain.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the feedback is great.
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you contributed the book as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Together made the book what it is,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Without those components, the book
wouldn't be what it was.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I was very surprised by the quality
of the info that's in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, there's a lot of scientific
terms and it goes really, really in depth
[SPEAKER_17]: into those things.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, there's a lot of details and
there's so many pictures.
[SPEAKER_17]: And like you said, there's so many people
that contribute.
[SPEAKER_17]: It to it too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the beautiful thing when we can
collaborate on these levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, collaborating on genetics,
we're doing some big collaborations coming
[SPEAKER_11]: up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, I want to collaborate with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love being able to collaborate and work
together with good people.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like minded, sharing genetics and
we all have our own styles, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the beauty of this whole thing
is like I can use my style for genetics,
[SPEAKER_11]: can use yours and together we can
collaborate and create a whole new book.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, because we all have different
tastes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Different ways of selecting, of
cultivating everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: So totally different.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like once you combine those two
different things, you can get something
[SPEAKER_17]: very surprising.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Quality is so subjective.
[SPEAKER_11]: People think, oh no, quality is quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: Quality to you and quality to me,
especially at that level.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's these nuances.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I love about it,
especially some of these breeders.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some guys are very outside the box.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some guys are very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just do the same thing over like
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the innovative outside the box
guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, like you said, you know,
like you said, it's like, well,
[SPEAKER_17]: it started, you know, with like only THC
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody was into THC.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now where there, there's a lot more
people looking for different things,
[SPEAKER_17]: nuances, all secondary, cannabinoids,
rare terps.
[SPEAKER_17]: So now it's, the market is evolving,
maturing, and it's way better.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I like it that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to see where this goes in a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you feel about it being the last
spandibus?
[SPEAKER_17]: This one, the last one, I didn't even know
it was going to be the last one until
[SPEAKER_17]: like, what, two weeks?
[SPEAKER_17]: Two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a little bit disappointing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know the reason why it's the
last one.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're tearing this whole building down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they're going to move it to,
they say they're moving it to Bilbao.
[SPEAKER_11]: But Bilbao is not the same as Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I heard they're also going to be doing
it on 420 weekend next year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's going to be really tough for me
to go to unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not as international as it is
here.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's harder to fly there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, everything is a little bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, I'm surprised that we're unable
to find another venue here in Barcelona or
[SPEAKER_17]: in the area.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my single favorite event of the
year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Jane, we're going this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be great too.
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I watch your podcast and you
talk about spandibus so often on there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, I have so many good memories
hanging out with people like yourself.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I have so many friends and the
only time I see a lot of them is here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Likewise, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very special.
[SPEAKER_17]: The weather is great.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not that great over there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what kind of new projects are you
working on?
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're working on a special project with
the Frosty's Purple Freak, which is a
[SPEAKER_17]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Which is also purple, very terpy as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you gifted us some seeds last year.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we're trying to create an auto
version of it with one of your best autos.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a very ambitious project.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes a lot of plants, a lot of,
you know, you need to hunt a lot in order
[SPEAKER_17]: to recombine those highly recessive
traits.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_17]: So whether it works, whether or not it
works, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's very interesting to be doing
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it'll work.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just about how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Statistically, it's possible, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Statistically, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Time and energy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Time and energy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like when you're a Raider,
you know that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, it's the long game.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd be growing flower if we didn't want
to do seeds for the short game,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would like to ask you a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: How long have you been a Raider for?
[SPEAKER_17]: Before, like you were a grower at first.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was a grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I started in closets, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Closet growing and breeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: We started early 2000s playing around with
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a really bad breeder in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, you know, I was like, all right,
put some pollen on here, a phenol.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing is, is anybody can make
seeds in the whole world, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody who can get a male plant,
take that pollen, put it on a female
[SPEAKER_11]: plant, can make seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: The magic from breeding actually comes in
the selection process.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like you're talking about
double recessive traits and stuff like
[SPEAKER_11]: that that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's real breeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's in the selection process,
finding those new phenos to actually breed
[SPEAKER_11]: with, to share with the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you make seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to call yourself a breeder?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really care what other people,
I look at myself, but like for myself,
[SPEAKER_11]: breeding really was like for the last 15
years, we've been doing real work.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think for the last 15 years,
there's some guys have been doing a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: longer, you know, but I think it's a
passion driven industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody that wants to breed can breed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to understand that the
selection process is the real breeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seed production is seed production.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but I have a question about that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So do you think it can be a breeder from
the get or do you think it has to be a
[SPEAKER_17]: pollen sucker first and then you start
breeding after, you know, you get the hang
[SPEAKER_17]: of hunting and all that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it almost should always start as a
hobby.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you should learn how to grow
really, really, really, really well so you
[SPEAKER_11]: can make the plant express.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you're not growing it well,
it's hard to select your keepers.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, everything looks very similar,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not getting the expressions of the
nose.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not getting expressions of the
structure.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not getting the structure properly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the better you grow, the better you
can do selections, the better breeder you
[SPEAKER_11]: become.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you have to have that dialed in and
then you can move on to the next step.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't just jump in the industry and I want
to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you can want to be a breeder,
but learn how to set that foundation up
[SPEAKER_11]: for success.
[SPEAKER_17]: And read the book, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And read the book.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: And read the book.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's available online too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, dude, thank you so much for your
support.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks to Billy for your time as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very glad to see you again.
Bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here in Spanavis with Dust from
Greenhouse Seeds Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are a strain hunter.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm a wannabe, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're a good friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're always happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have this contagious happiness vibe
that just spreads throughout the industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: It touches everybody.
[SPEAKER_26]: I try to keep it smiling.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, someone's got to be happy all the
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not me, but man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's contagious.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a happy guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I try to be happy, dude.
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't be humble.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how's your Spanavis going?
[SPEAKER_26]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a lot of meetings, a lot of people
that you're going to see probably for the
[SPEAKER_26]: last time because who knows what's going
to be the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you say it like that, it makes me
sad.
[SPEAKER_26]: There's some people from this industry in
Spain that would come only if they go to
[SPEAKER_26]: other places.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a lot of people I only see
at Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm appreciating every minute.
[SPEAKER_26]: I just say hello to everybody.
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of people coming to say thank you
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's always amazing to meet all those
people watching the video.
[SPEAKER_26]: You never see them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've been working in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're doing all kinds of stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thailand is like a paradise now.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you're smiling all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It must be.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the good weed.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, really good weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get to spend a lot of time with
plants these days.
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell me about some famous amazing
moments that you've had at Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, some of my best memories here was
before opening the club.
[SPEAKER_26]: So maybe 2012, 2013, something like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: It was also the beginning of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_26]: So here you could really see the first
really good BHO.
[SPEAKER_26]: Because in Spain, it was not a big scene
yet.
[SPEAKER_26]: The extractor scene.
[SPEAKER_26]: So people from America would bring great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: So it was the first time that you had
those kind of terpenes that get to your
[SPEAKER_26]: mouth because it was a kick in the face.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys was over terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: All with Franco.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just the amount of flavor that you
get from a BHO dab at that moment in the
[SPEAKER_26]: history.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, wow, what is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I still remember those days.
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, great times.
[SPEAKER_26]: And hanging out with Don and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_26]: They always had really good extracts and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the Spanish people here got
really good at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, they really did.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny, the evolution from 15 years
ago in Spain to now.
[SPEAKER_11]: With extraction, with flower, with
everything.
[SPEAKER_26]: Exponential.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exponential growth.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people, they take it real seriously
here too.
[SPEAKER_11]: The guys that are really passionate about
it take it super serious.
[SPEAKER_26]: I would say that some of the best hash
makers in the world are in Spain now.
Me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of them are Italian.
[SPEAKER_11]: Including everybody.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but they're all here.
[SPEAKER_26]: And they all got inspired by this culture,
by this energy that's in Spain.
[SPEAKER_26]: In Barcelona in particular.
[SPEAKER_26]: Barcelona has a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've seen some amazing hash in the
last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_11]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, a lot of stuff is like... Great
rosin, great hash.
[SPEAKER_26]: Great flowers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, in the States we have the papayas
and the GMOs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of diversity out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And diversity with types of hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people still love bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't have to be rosin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_26]: And we still have the love for the
Moroccan hash too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the real tradition.
[SPEAKER_26]: This is where Europe is really attractive,
you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_26]: You also have the roots.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_26]: You got the new school, the old school,
all together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything in between.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a pleasure, man.
[SPEAKER_26]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here, day three, Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the final countdown.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have hours left of this day.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the last Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little sad.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bittersweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing that we're here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Saturday, it's the last day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi again, Homegrown TV coming to you from
Spannibus 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just picked ourselves some fresh food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the drips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got the foam party, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homegrown TV, hi again to YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be growing these suckers
out from seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and basement grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't make it, but he's going to be
growing them out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wash testing these suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much love, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spannibus 2025.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with Aaron from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, Aaron?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last Spannibus in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you here, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: The last time we saw each other,
it was kind of a sad day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam, the skunk man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Skunk man, Sam, passing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was a nice memorial.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a really nice memorial.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really good people showing up to the
memorial.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: His contributions to our industry were
huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you sign the book that Dougie has over
at his booth?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I need to get over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a booth over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only booth I ever went to,
except for like right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not leave my booth the entire
weekend.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm here solo.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got my cameraman, but I've been running
the booth myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got our collaboration, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: The chocolate runs I made with your
choclobe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Choclobe runs, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We may be having cuts available to the
public in the near future.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just have to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Direct to consumer off our website.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, keep your eyes open for those cuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Show being good for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been, you know, it's amazing every
time I get to hang out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, we've been hanging out
together for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: But seeing my friends just like you guys
at events, it's like it's great bumping
[SPEAKER_11]: into good people that are out there for
the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_11]: They respect the plant that have been put
in the work.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys put in the work before anybody
else coming out of the States.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you were kind of the first American
seed company to really... Almost.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's some others in front of
us, you know, we can't forget.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah, Watson was... Dave Watson
first.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, there's guys coming out of the
70s and 80s, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: But as far as like modern times,
West Coast genetics, bringing OG,
[SPEAKER_11]: bringing that gas to Europe, showing the
world how it's done and showing guys like
[SPEAKER_11]: me that you could do it, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you could do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you just put your foot on the gas
pedal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we got that common connection with
Soma because Soma's been part of our lives
[SPEAKER_11]: at different points.
[SPEAKER_11]: At different points in our lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, Soma was an important,
pivotal part in my life as well as yours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Soma was there before we started
DNA.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell me some... What's your best memory
of Spanavis?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the best times of Spanavis are the
times that I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's lots of those.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of those for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've gone out and had dinners over the
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's just a party.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's one good party.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one good party.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you end up going from one place
to another place.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm not from around here,
so I couldn't tell you where the fuck I
[SPEAKER_08]: really went.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's... I love this place.
[SPEAKER_11]: I spent a lot of time here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dinners here are amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to seeing you in Berlin or
at home if you guys are coming up.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to do another podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to smoke some more weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to release these clones to the
public so everyone can try the cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been... It's always good to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always good to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always good to smoke out with you,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think we just ran into each other,
like, at the Zal Olympics so we could...
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were literally at the Zal Olympics.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the last time we saw each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were both so high that... Yeah,
that was a good time, though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was like 2012 high times cannabis
cups, like that same vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Medical days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to James Loud in the Loud
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch your spec.
[SPEAKER_08]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_08]: 2025.
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am here with the man, the myth,
Cannabis Chris from SF Canna, San
[SPEAKER_11]: Francisco, California, my hometown.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, Chris?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spannibus is amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, so this is your first Spannibus,
yes?
[SPEAKER_11]: Very first one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what do you think of Spannibus so
far?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I've only been here for the two
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed the first, but the two days I've
been here has been fucking wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second day was crazier than the first,
and today seems to be shaping up to be an
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing day as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Highlights of the trip so far?
[SPEAKER_03]: Highlights of the trips are... Well,
I would have to say... I can't say too
[SPEAKER_03]: much about the party last night,
but all the dope little social clubs that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been walking into, Alma Social Club,
the 420, Area 420 yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the other one we met at?
[SPEAKER_11]: We met... So we met... You came to the
bar, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: We came to the bar.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the number two bar in...
[SPEAKER_11]: Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_11]: Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had the back room out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We blew that thing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secret room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You walk through the back door,
through the toilet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the shit is wild out here,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Speakeasy, it's like very
American-style Speakeasy secret back room
[SPEAKER_11]: to the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my first time in Barcelona,
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it reminds me a lot of... I swear I
was on Market Street in Frisco a few
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I was in New York a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has that vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I'm having a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking a bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out smoking a rest, per usual.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, James?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get that shit confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get the shit confused, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if it ain't cannabis, Chris approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for some new drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and James got some fucking fire
dropping, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're dropping some stuff together in
a couple months here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally, we're dropping some fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some loud fucking genetics that are coming
exclusively from the man to the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_03]: So look for that and look for some new
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dropping some new music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am an artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you feel me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you got this cannabis shit
confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it ain't cannabis, Chris approved,
baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here at Spannibus with Dave from
Gastown.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing today, Dave?
[SPEAKER_04]: Super good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little big, but you know, day three of
Spannibus to be expected.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little tired, a little big.
[SPEAKER_11]: Had an amazing weekend.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys had a busy booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was people all around your booth the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're grateful to have the
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my eighth Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think our fourth year in the booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've seen people year after year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, they come back and say hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really cool to see the familiar
faces and the love year after year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love the chill vibe of the
greenhouse booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like we got Chris from Cypher.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys and us just having a good time
here with Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, these guys are very inclusive.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's exclusive, but it's inclusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So grateful to be part of this booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys year after year treat us like
family and just give us an opportunity
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'd never be able to have any other
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're front center.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like you said, the vibes are
super inclusive, but exclusive at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the top brands and names in the
industry always come through here and say
[SPEAKER_04]: hi, Ari on the crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to kind of witness and be a part
of that energy is a really cool vibe for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like one big family, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the industry we're in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can be so cool with everybody else
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's so many good people,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's doing their own part to kind of
elevate the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the good people definitely have
been drawn together over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just more and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see them kind of getting drawn
together and raising each other up and
[SPEAKER_04]: lifting each other up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell us some of the highlights of your
trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Highlights of my trip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Being in Barcelona, the dinners are
probably the highlight of my trip here,
[SPEAKER_04]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously connecting with all the
people, whether it be people who follow us
[SPEAKER_04]: and are huge supporters or people who I
look up to and get to see year after year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's all the people being
from Canada, just a little brand,
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing all these big names.
[SPEAKER_04]: From California that I get to connect
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just super grateful to have these
relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just really cool to be able to
come all the way out here so far away from
[SPEAKER_04]: home and build these relationships that
are really cool and people that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: always looked up to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so much for your time,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: My absolute pleasure, James.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we got to do their podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to come up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see if they let me in.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, I'm down to come down and do
the podcast any time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots to talk about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're here wrapping up Spannibus 2025.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am here with the king of cannabis,
Arien Roskam and Dust, his right hand man,
[SPEAKER_11]: killing it over in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we had an amazing, amazing,
the best Spannibus ever.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Crazy turnout, but crazy.
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody came in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much for the
hospitality.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the third year I've been at your
booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have saved me a lot of heartache.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for having my own booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to be part of something much
bigger than ourselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I couldn't do what I do without
guys like you.
[SPEAKER_25]: No, we're very happy to have guys like you
in our booth and give people from the
[SPEAKER_25]: other side of the world an opportunity to
be with us and feel the great feeling of
[SPEAKER_25]: Spain here and the cannabis world here in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you for coming again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell me some of your best memories of
Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_25]: We were opening our club in 2014.
[SPEAKER_25]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_25]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_25]: It was during the Spannibus also.
[SPEAKER_25]: That was quite, I think, maybe the most
amazing moment for us.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it was special.
[SPEAKER_25]: It was pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_25]: And still until now.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, last night you saw every night the
club is packed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every night, that's why.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very successful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Super happy with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the best flower in the whole city.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good food.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have really good food there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're looking for food,
you got to go check out Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: The burgers are?
[SPEAKER_11]: The burgers on fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: The hash.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, the hash next level.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: New school, old school.
[SPEAKER_26]: He does the QC on the hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: The quality control is right here.
[SPEAKER_26]: Everything has to go through.
[SPEAKER_26]: The QC guy.
[SPEAKER_26]: QC guy.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, we like good food.
[SPEAKER_26]: We all love good food.
[SPEAKER_26]: We love the turps.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all about the turps here.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all what tastes good.
[SPEAKER_25]: Otherwise, we don't eat it.
[SPEAKER_25]: We refuse.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's no point.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you're the one who said it
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would you eat shit?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather not eat than eat shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: In America especially.
[SPEAKER_25]: One time a day you have to find a nice
restaurant or you have to cook nice in
[SPEAKER_25]: your house or you have to eat with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_25]: Only actually one time a day is enough to
eat.
[SPEAKER_25]: You can try two times a day if you're
lucky.
[SPEAKER_11]: And same with the smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why waste your lungs and your life on
something that's not amazing?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the final moments of Spantibus 2025,
we're planning for our dinner later.
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope to see you guys in Berlin,
Mary Jane this June.
[SPEAKER_11]: And your next holiday destination,
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to go check out Greenhouse in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are just blowing up over in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: All this stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the number one holiday destination
in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to going to Thailand
this year.
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to come by, man.
[SPEAKER_26]: You're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_26]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, thank you guys for everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to seeing you guys very
soon.
Peace.
