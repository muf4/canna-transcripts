[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James lab podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and today our special guest We have two of
them net from beanstalk and we have Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: from mother Magnolia cannabis in Eugene,
Oregon How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm great, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Thank you so much for having us
doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely, man I'm glad you guys
were able to make it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Emerald Cup this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be a Busy weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see what they do with it in
Oakland, you know It's totally new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally mind-blowing that they went
from Santa Rosa to Oakland We went from
[SPEAKER_00]: the hippie to the hip hop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll see how that works out You
know, I mean I've had so many things going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in my life that I'm like, oh that's not
gonna work and then it works out So maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it won't maybe it's gonna be
somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they Need to work on it,
you know, yeah, I mean, I think the 510
[SPEAKER_04]: has a quite the big history with with
cannabis to begin with It's not I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland especially I mean it was yeah as
far as legalization and the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and the movement Yeah, a lot of it started
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This this is kind of the epicenter the Bay
Area is the epicenter but I feel like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup was more geared towards
hippies hippie culture humbled harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time Especially especially like in
December when we were judging it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh fresh off the mountain, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember the Emerald Cup is really
being a celebration of the outdoor grower
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right and that really being the kind
of the pinnacle Yeah of like the best
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor flower, you know, you're gonna
find it all at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally I mean in back in the day the
judges they would have a Handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: entries now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a hundred and fifty flower
entries and I it's pretty wild the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of people entering And exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean all these things evolve everything
evolves we evolve as companies Events
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve or they die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you either have to evolve or you know,
that's it Yeah, I mean I've always been
[SPEAKER_04]: curious at the judging process when you
have so many strains, you know I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine the task of having to judge say a
hundred strains Yeah, you've got to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: decent amount of time in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you know hunting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same process that that we do
and we're going through different genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have a hundred different plants
that we have to test out I'm sure I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so first you got to organize
them, you know, you organize them by
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothing Smell look, however,
you want to do it and then you kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: in and especially if you're tasting them
You want to judge them for taste and
[SPEAKER_00]: effect because one thing is smelling and
you can do the visual and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes down to it, you really
have to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to try it But as far as
like an effect You don't have a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: days to where you can get a fresh start
every day with one to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah This one makes me feel like this
you can tell the strength of something if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's stronger But there's subtleties that
you're gonna miss when you have to judge
[SPEAKER_00]: that many.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, I think this was almost like
there's a bias to the first one that you
[SPEAKER_04]: try that day for sure That's gonna be the
one that's probably gonna have the most
[SPEAKER_04]: lingering impact on your psyche is the
first one that you gravitate towards that
[SPEAKER_00]: day Yeah, but then there's gonna be the
ones that are super strong where you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like That's the one that that one
got me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That one made me feel tired or that
one man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my heart's racing a little bit
after that one hit You know, and I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like rosin judging rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's those subtleties Are a
little more intense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with flour, it's like not as intense
sometimes and it's more subtle whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin It's all concentrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this there's a lot more I would say
Congruity between the smell and the taste
[SPEAKER_04]: and rosin when flour sometimes you can
have that flour It smells and looks
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible purple punch, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like paper Well, we were talking
about our good friend Chris Castle and he
[SPEAKER_00]: has a Donnie burger, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his flour is not Anything that I'd
be like Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some of that but the Donnie burger
rosin I'm like dude, it's such an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you know, we shared it on the
regular river podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made everybody try it I was like
literally going around with the little
[SPEAKER_00]: dipper making people try it right out of
the jar and everybody's like wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff is ridiculous and It's just
it's a concentration, but it's different
[SPEAKER_00]: than the flour Like the taste is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's a concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you concentrate things they
don't all concentrate the same That's
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so some flavors can Concentrate it
can provide almost an unpleasant flavor
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or some of them It's so faint that
when you concentrate it you get just the
[SPEAKER_00]: right amount Yeah, and I mean I think
something like skittles, right you
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate it and it's concentrated in
the right way where it's like Wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're constant It doesn't matter whether
it's rosin whether it's bh o or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it is Yeah, all that stuff it skittles is
amazing and I think skittles derivatives
[SPEAKER_00]: like moon bow Yeah, you know you get any
of those moon bows and I think They're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty amazing and they lean heavy,
especially the ones that lean heavy on the
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where it's like candy It's got this
but but it like checks the boxes because
[SPEAKER_04]: skittles really doesn't yeah, I think when
it comes to effect I think that's where a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people are left Desiring more with
skittles certainly as a flavor experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's ten out of ten eleven out of
ten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh And yeah, we actually hunted a I
actually hunted a you know moon bow from
[SPEAKER_04]: the archive pack that he released from the
IX and a buddy of mine in Atlanta actually
[SPEAKER_04]: He found an incredible keeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it is like you said,
it's it's very z-leaning, but it's got a
[SPEAKER_04]: little more complexity underneath It's got
a little bit of that og funk probably
[SPEAKER_04]: getting it from its its dosy roots,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a lot more potency when
people talk about z forward That is z
[SPEAKER_00]: forward all the way like that is very z
forward, but it's very complex It has an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try it yesterday Chris gave me
some when he grew it out and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow a very exciting And I love stuff
that's not diet skittles that's a skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: cross because some people like oh
everything you pull with skittles is
[SPEAKER_00]: better That's not true Especially the
stuff that like where you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ooh because I can pick out a room where
I'm like, okay, that's skittles That's not
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles that leans towards the other
parent You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuz it's usually the shitty structure You
look at the weakest plants with the shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and those lean heavy on the
skills So it takes a lot of work and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think archive has done a really good job
You know with that and they've I've I've
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked three or four Different moonbow
cuts that are all like really special in
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways, you know That was the
hardest hunt we've ever done and also the
[SPEAKER_04]: easiest hunt we've ever done Yeah hardest
because there wasn't a lot of like bad
[SPEAKER_04]: Finos They were all pretty good easiest
because the one that we ended up selecting
[SPEAKER_04]: was just the head and shoulders Yeah,
it was just it was that limey mouth
[SPEAKER_04]: coating along with like the cushy
aftertaste and the strong effect I mean it
[SPEAKER_00]: was really a well then it comes down to
the jar test when you have so many good
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the gauge that my crew uses which jar
emptied first, yeah every time I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that's uh, I think that's perfect because
it just speaks to What you want to go back
[SPEAKER_04]: to again any authenticity, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want obviously you want product
out there that the customer feels the same
[SPEAKER_04]: way about yeah, like man I finished that
if I go back today, you think they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: still have more I hope so totally and then
there's a no it's like well there might be
[SPEAKER_04]: more but We're not sharing it That's the
really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I find myself holding back stuff at
the end because I like sharing it with my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends But there's a certain amount I
want to just save for myself Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with really good stuff and it
doesn't have to be new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like strange Yeah, I love super silver
haze, you know I think I got some real
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel at reggae on the river and you
guys are very familiar with that kind I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I I got some buds I gave a
little bit out to a couple different
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and I saved the last For myself
hoping to get more this weekend at Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup Because it's the real cut and I
haven't had real sour diesel in forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So I see a lot of people give me man
strength our state say it's our diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: because I talk about on my podcast so much
that and cat piss I've gotten a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: different cat pisses that I haven't been
super impressed with a lot of sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm like it leans It's more of a chem
91 or a chem D than a real sour even
[SPEAKER_00]: though it looks like sour it leans towards
that really burnt tire gas and even when
[SPEAKER_00]: you squeeze it you don't get a lot of
citrus and I want to a Flower that punches
[SPEAKER_00]: me in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like the real sour when you open a
bag of it It would like literally pop you
[SPEAKER_04]: in the nose and you'd be like,
wow, that's amazing Yeah, I think I think
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a couple things going on with sour
one with a cut That's as old and as
[SPEAKER_04]: popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it's gonna have so many
derivatives s ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think it was an s1 We can debate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I believe I believe it was a bag
seed from the chem 91 I think a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: old strains probably were you know before
there was a lot of actual Breeders that
[SPEAKER_04]: were you know, deliberately breeding,
you know, you got some bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hell yeah Let's pop this and I think
the other issue that sour presents that it
[SPEAKER_04]: is such a difficult strain to cultivate It
is I mean it is one of the skittles
[SPEAKER_04]: another one Yeah, I think sours more
difficult than skittles due to how long it
[SPEAKER_04]: has to run I agree and you need to
maintain A perfect course for over 80
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, that's not a lot of systems
commercial production people are just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to have the timer patient There's
not a lot of people that'll want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then because you start looking at
numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second you start looking at numbers
and you know, you you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like It doesn't pencil out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and unfortunately, yeah,
you need that cycle to turn at 63 days I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean most of our selections are for that
so we can get five cycles skills of 53 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 56 in my opinion He pulls the best it
always finishing a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely But if you look at an
extra month for sour, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know 77 days or whatever or plus
77 plus I think to get personally I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe 11 or 11 to 12 weeks when I used
to go it was 11 to finish proper to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah to let it finish properly and it
still doesn't look like it's done at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end It still wants to keep going you still
get them white hairs on the top a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and yeah, and then they finish pink a
little Bit, you know, that's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever seen that you get
a little cares on the pistols Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens is it dries it has almost a
it's there there The way the the white
[SPEAKER_00]: ones dry is they'll dry almost pink ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking in the bag It's not
like pink like right pink or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a dull red a dull red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you get that with certain genetics
and Yeah, and even the crosses some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses we made back in the day with sour
definitely had they did have pink pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: So really cool pink pistols, especially
Like when it was like three weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and you got a whole bunch of pink
pistols on the crosses Yeah, those would
[SPEAKER_04]: always make the high times covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah They look amazing and then they
go away Really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I don't I can't say I've had
a good batch of sour since so I went to
[SPEAKER_04]: college at Humboldt State University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and Yeah, I think my last batch of
sour that made me go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow was actually in 2013 Yeah,
you know it's and since then a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that's come my way just like you've
Expressed there's a lot of like that burnt
[SPEAKER_04]: rubber and I just remember the sour diesel
having such a citral citrus kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: brightness to it along with gas and It's
gotta have citrus to have that citrus and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you don't get the nose burn from the
gas You get the nose burn from the citrus,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have that file But it's that
citrusy nose burn where it's not haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is citrus, you know Cuz like that
haze is a different thing altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely different so much
grapefruit, which is a New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel which is completely different from
sour diesel also has like a citrus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a grapefruit citrus as opposed to
like Lemony lime like I would say haze is
[SPEAKER_00]: haze goes in the more lime category and
then that sour was like a sweet lemon like
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing like And and I remember for the
longest time there was only one sour there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't multiple types There wasn't a bunch
of derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a bunch of ECSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just sour diesel, you know,
and then you know And I'm sure over in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had like different names and
stuff like that And you know, then we got
[SPEAKER_00]: the weasels diesel and the AJ's diesel and
the you know, all these different Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: and humbled sours was all like sours.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's yeah, that's everyone just
called it sours You know, we need sours
[SPEAKER_04]: old guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need sours old guys Well, yeah,
and I think the naming big they came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the name sour because it's our
relationships Not because it was sour
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my reading book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I I wanted to get to the bottom of it
get as much information as possible for my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding book and get the information as
Correct as possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it no matter what there's always
gonna be something There's there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred fifteen thousand words So we
didn't get it all perfect and I'm okay
[SPEAKER_00]: with that But I feel like we did our due
diligence to try to get everything correct
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I have that where did that
history come from in terms of its souring
[SPEAKER_07]: relationships?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you so I I've actually talked to
Greg chem dog so Greg who is chem dog and
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to him and then I talked to Mike
P bud and a couple other guys and Mojave
[SPEAKER_00]: Richmond and Started getting stories from
everybody and then I got on a conference
[SPEAKER_00]: call and we kind of sorted out what I had
written and what should be written Also
[SPEAKER_00]: about the chem dog, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there's a case study my book has
case studies So we went through got a good
[SPEAKER_00]: case study on the sour Mac one,
which is extremely special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the biggest fan of the Mac one for
smoke, but I absolutely Think it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah as far as legacy and everything else
like not legacy market But legacy for cap
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like it's a special one it hit
when it hit and it's it's really special
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a partial triploid, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to breed with it,
you know natural partial natural triploid
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really cool I mean I get excited
about these genetic things and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: as much of that stuff as we could include
in the book We did yeah next version is
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna have even more stuff That explains
why the Mac one has always been hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with yeah and phylos Yep,
phylos did the study on that and so yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's pretty cool Yeah making seeds
and then it's also an anomaly because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of recessive stuff going on with it
If you look at the week, I got a Mac 69
[SPEAKER_00]: From first-class genetics and for my buddy
Ray and that was Hayes that was like
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian Tasted like smoking old-school
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing dad in it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the miracle So yeah,
completely the opposite You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get that Hayes in the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very soft a little bit of floral It's
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my favorite thing in the world,
but it's still really cool Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean when that one took off,
I mean that you want to talk about a wave
[SPEAKER_04]: like a new way a new wave You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean almost I remember seeing Capulator
Emerald Cup and there was like a line like
[SPEAKER_00]: over a hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Just like Santa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep with a hundred foot long line for
people and he spends time With everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love seeing guys in the industry
They care about the people that buy their
[SPEAKER_00]: product and you know that show loves the
people that show love to them Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been lucky enough to have a
conversation with Fletcher and yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like most of the time we were
actually I grow a lot of other stuff in my
[SPEAKER_04]: backyard a lot of citrus avocados nice and
when I realized that we spent most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: time talking about citrus Yeah,
I was like I you know, there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain love that you need to have for
plants and general cultivation that I
[SPEAKER_04]: think it you know, really Makes you the
best cannabis grower period right when you
[SPEAKER_04]: can go out a little bit outside of just
this plant that we all really do love so
[SPEAKER_04]: much and when I see like such a deep love
for plants and other breeders and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that's that's probably why I've always
gravitated to his work so much for sure
[SPEAKER_04]: the appreciation for flavor that goes
beyond cannabis and the magic of what
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can do well, and I think there's
you got to have a drive to keep on
[SPEAKER_00]: improving right because I think A lot of
people they learn how to grow and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they just stop at a certain point and like
that's that's what they do They found
[SPEAKER_00]: their way and that's that's the end of
gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the guys were like, how can I make
this better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been doing it for 20 years
still like how can I make it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the best guys out there,
you know and same thing with breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the guys who haven't figured it
all out and are willing to experiment and
[SPEAKER_00]: and still have passion about it because
You know you get beat up a lot in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to have passion that goes
beyond money You know, it's like because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other things you can do to make
money out there But a lot of us this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were meant to do, you know,
nothing more than this and it's it's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we love doing It's what we love talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We eat sleep and breathe it and you know,
it's like I have random conversations with
[SPEAKER_00]: people at airports about cannabis and you
know, we start talking about stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing we're talking about flower
We're talking about this or we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about rosin and it's like you can tell
kind of who's who and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's doing what I mean Not everybody has
the look but you can kind of tell yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I think or the smell I was in I was
actually in nursing school before I jumped
[SPEAKER_04]: into the industry Oh, wow, and I had so
much guilt about just this wealth of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis knowledge that I had,
you know I've been smoking since I was 15
[SPEAKER_04]: 16.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I started growing when I moved up to
Humboldt and I just I just loved it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I loved it I was talking to Tom
a little bit earlier the strain made me
[SPEAKER_04]: fall in love with cannabis was blueberry I
remember my first batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it was it Oregon blueberry was a DJ
sure it was it was coming up from Humboldt
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the name was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was only 16 17 at the time And
it was like the first non-generic smelling
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis that I had gotten and I just
remember being like Why does it smell like
[SPEAKER_04]: this?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did they do to make it smell like
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was like the moment where I was
like I want to know everything about this
[SPEAKER_04]: plant and you know, It's such a magical
smell, you know It's a strain that will
[SPEAKER_04]: always have a special place in my heart
for that reason What was the guilt?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the guilt?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the guilt was that like I was in
nursing school man, and I was just like I
[SPEAKER_04]: like You can do so much more with me No,
it wasn't that it was that like I have all
[SPEAKER_04]: this knowledge about strains, right where
they came from who bred them Like I cared
[SPEAKER_04]: so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I was like I'm holding on to all
this information It's not gonna do
[SPEAKER_04]: anything for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guilt is in not being the torchbearer for
all that information is in my just like
[SPEAKER_04]: why do I care so much about something
that's not not part of the career that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: going into You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just like it was just I just
Carried all this like guilt for all this
[SPEAKER_04]: like I couldn't talk about this to the
people in my program Like yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this was still very much a kind of
place where yeah, I wouldn't talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking I wouldn't talk about Canada's all
I wanted to talk about right But you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was around these people where I was like
I can't talk about it ever You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean and there might even come a day
where I'm gonna get tested and all this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff so it was a really that part was
really tricky and Then I just kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: slipped into the industry and I just I
dropped out It was actually right during
[SPEAKER_04]: kovat when I dropped it was in in March.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished that semester I said,
you know kovat was really good for
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really I mean, how's this every
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were making money during kovat you
were doing something was like you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be doing cannabis because I feel
like all my friends Really killed it
[SPEAKER_00]: drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our biggest year yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had my Biggest year of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah I thought I was gonna be one of
the worst years, but it was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best years and and it's funny That's
another one where it's like it looks bad
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you get through it and you're
like, wow That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean look at how many people
absolutely lost everything during kovat
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know Dispensaries were essential
businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had liquor stores cannabis shops and
and grocery stores that were open during
[SPEAKER_00]: during kovat Yeah, and everyone's at home
Smoking drinking, you know Hanna checks,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know doing that remote work,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah go it was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's interesting that you would have
made that switch during Yeah, I mean it
[SPEAKER_04]: just it was it was you know I kind of I
had a little added little Instagram page
[SPEAKER_04]: where I was I started growing at home
again And that's always been my love,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: My love has always been so I have a minor
in chemistry and The lab work right the
[SPEAKER_04]: the importance of doing a small experiment
with highly controllable Inputs in order
[SPEAKER_04]: to expand that to a larger thing was
something that I always loved And so I I
[SPEAKER_04]: like to keep my growing small scale for
that reason, you know easy to manage easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to turn easy to know what's changing and
what isn't and That's when beanstalk had
[SPEAKER_04]: reached out to me and they were like,
hey, we love your page You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you want to grow with a granular style
fertilizer and I was like no I have a
[SPEAKER_04]: minor in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure I can mix nutrients fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't sure I don't need a Granular
style fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one of those things that I
think is a little counterintuitive to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in this industry in this
industry people are like no I need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things and sometimes it's a lot
more simple Yeah, so as you well know
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been working with beanstalk for a
while, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that We I think we got
turned on you guys through Nelson.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he was the gateway drug there He
said first it's free and that was it So
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, it was about five years ago that and
you know, my team looked at me like are
[SPEAKER_07]: you fucking crazy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody was on board with the idea at all
But you know, I you know, you were
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioning a moment ago You know the idea
of just sort of that relentless pursuit of
[SPEAKER_07]: refining things and testing and and and
you know That's good, but we can do it
[SPEAKER_07]: better right that works But maybe we can
do it cheaper that works, but maybe we can
[SPEAKER_07]: you know create a hybrid model and that's
That's essentially what we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean we We start, you know, we were
we've grown a soil forever Soil has been
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, our our medium and it's it's
what we're you know, it's what we was the
[SPEAKER_07]: hill will die on Yeah, but it's all you
know, organic inputs Top dresses compost
[SPEAKER_07]: teas and and when I looked at my you know
lead grower and I was like, hey We're
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna try some beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like what I was like, yeah,
let's just do some experiments.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start small and we'll just see where
it goes Yeah, so we're all about just you
[SPEAKER_07]: know testing retesting testing retesting
and seeing what works and and beanstalk it
[SPEAKER_07]: was it was a big surprise to everybody big
surprise to everybody and You know that
[SPEAKER_07]: we've we've tried about every
configuration with beanstalk with our
[SPEAKER_07]: organic inputs and we've you know,
we've landed on a hybrid model that That
[SPEAKER_00]: just works Yeah, it's amazing when you
find something that works Especially
[SPEAKER_00]: something that like people like how the
heck did that happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Maybe we should rewind and talk a
little bit about what the product is for
[SPEAKER_04]: those who've never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'd be great So yeah,
so so what beanstalk is it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: granular style fertilizer That was
specifically formulated to be used with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and the idea came from a very
simple premise You look at horticulture
[SPEAKER_04]: outside of cannabis and granular style
fertilizers are dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not by a little but by a lot,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They the majority of Large horticultural
applications are using like a granular
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in the cut flower industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so from inception our founders
were you know Like okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well if this can work for other plants,
how can we make it work for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we use a coating that was initially
developed by NASA to be used on the ISS
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is special about the coating and
that makes our product different to other
[SPEAKER_04]: granular style fertilizers is that it is
activated by irrigation events,
[SPEAKER_04]: so The coating is composed of a bunch of
micro micro pores that open up when the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant is watered It seems like a simple
Change but in actuality and practice that
[SPEAKER_04]: actually makes a big difference for
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having hot days That means that
your plants are going to be drinking more
[SPEAKER_04]: our fertilizer is going to be releasing
more a lot of traditional granular style
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizers on the market they offer a
like a polyurethane coating or a
[SPEAKER_04]: polyethylene micro plastic coating and it
dissolves you're kind of locked into a
[SPEAKER_04]: daily payload and Then when the heat gets
to a certain point, it'll just break down
[SPEAKER_04]: and right fertility dump and roast all
your plants So we needed something a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more high-tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we found the coating Eventually
we had to play with formulations It
[SPEAKER_04]: started out as an all-in-one when we
realized that that wasn't going to work We
[SPEAKER_04]: separated our product into four lines or
four products two lines We have our bloom
[SPEAKER_04]: line, which is composed of three products
our absolute flower That's the flagship
[SPEAKER_04]: product has all your macros and micros and
we have a K boost which is pretty simple
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just potassium magnesium and sulfur
and we have our calcium four-dimensional
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is just calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice those three together make up our blue
mix It's really easy to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you'll see here in these
little pouches is those three products
[SPEAKER_04]: pre-mixed This is for this is a product
that we made for the home grower Someone
[SPEAKER_04]: who's just growing a couple plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, take one of those rip it open throw
it in a five gallon pot It'll give you two
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks of edge and up to ten weeks of flour
with one dose Nice and simple and then our
[SPEAKER_04]: other product is an all-in-one product,
but it's only for mothers and nursery
[SPEAKER_04]: stock It's for your veg plants really easy
to use 25 grams per gallon And it's meant
[SPEAKER_04]: to be used with that dosage to 25 grams
per gallon Dosage is mainly for cocoa core
[SPEAKER_04]: or peat moss something that's very lightly
amended But what I what I really am
[SPEAKER_04]: excited to have Tom here for is to talk
because he uses our product in a way
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very unique He's not married to
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not married to organics Yeah,
and he has a really unique use case where
[SPEAKER_04]: he's not using it at full strength or even
close to full strength but that's fine,
[SPEAKER_04]: right because As a grower myself,
you know, the biggest my thing I care
[SPEAKER_04]: about the most is am I helping other
growers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I helping other people be successful?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, you know the fact that people's
livelihoods are gonna be staked on You
[SPEAKER_04]: know the product that I'm selling isn't
lost on me sure That's actually something
[SPEAKER_04]: means a lot to me and so to have the
opportunity if someone like Tom whose team
[SPEAKER_04]: Has been so creative in their application
of the product and share that with other
[SPEAKER_04]: people I think is really exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, so how long has Beanstalk been
around?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, so it's been around for it's been
around for a while I think we're going on
[SPEAKER_04]: seven years now It originally had a
different name and had a completely
[SPEAKER_04]: different set of owners initially and
that's where the current owner and They
[SPEAKER_04]: pitched it to the current owner and they
said hey, you know, this is a product you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to be involved He's not a cannabis
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but he seemed interesting enough
Yeah, this looks interesting You know like
[SPEAKER_04]: solid potential solid potential worked
with a couple consultants in the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: And the consultants kind of helped
reformulate the product and get it into
[SPEAKER_04]: the state that it's in now And that was
the inception was I believe seven years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago And the new team has been running with
it for about five years and I jumped on
[SPEAKER_04]: board In 2022 is when I jumped on board
nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, they reached out to me via
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I initially was pretty stuck up You
know, like I don't need I don't need
[SPEAKER_04]: granules to grow my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what I'm doing They kept kind of
bugging me Nelson actually offered me some
[SPEAKER_04]: flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Went up to Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some of the flour and I was like,
hey This is better than I was expecting
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and this is pretty convincing You
know, I think if you if you'll talk to him
[SPEAKER_04]: about his conversations with me Yeah,
he's never had an easy time convincing me,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's that's part of our
relationship Is that I've never I look I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: a very data driven person sure My formal
education has led me to be just like a
[SPEAKER_04]: very very evidence driven person.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I like to make my decisions And
when I tried the flower, you know to be
[SPEAKER_04]: totally honest It was a lot harsher than
anything that I would call acceptable,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was like, hey, hey, I pulled this
at 56 days Like I didn't like I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: even attempt to like flush it This was
like a quick and dirty fino hunt and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, well that checks Out it definitely
just tastes like it's very high in
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was enough to be like I wonder what
I could do with this So I did it and my
[SPEAKER_04]: first batch, you know my regular clients
Hey, did you do something different this
[SPEAKER_04]: time?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good And my ego was so shot,
you know what I mean to think my first
[SPEAKER_04]: time growing with these granules It was
the least work I had ever done and my
[SPEAKER_04]: customers were stoked, you know,
and I was just like oh my god But you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, I really was expecting to hear
something else I really wasn't expecting
[SPEAKER_04]: right to get all this praise and then the
wheel started turning and I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm gonna keep rocking with this
product I want to see how far I can push
[SPEAKER_04]: it and that turned into a job opportunity
and that's when I dropped out of nursing
[SPEAKER_04]: school and I was like, you know,
I'd be that'd be silly to not take the
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to go work for We're still
very much a smart startup.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still pretty small company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I'm from the Bay Area We are in
a sense that a lot of a lot of our R&D was
[SPEAKER_04]: in Santa Rosa But everything is stored in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like our major warehouse is in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of our operations are in Florida But
you know a lot of our research and
[SPEAKER_04]: development did happen right here in the
Bay Area So Santa Rosa is close enough to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it feels like the Bay Area to me
even though it's a little north,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah Yeah, for sure So yeah,
it's been it's been a great run with them
[SPEAKER_04]: so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a product that I really
believe in You know Tom and I were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier about you know, a lot of
Individuals approach to cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_04]: dogmatic some individuals can be but we
really feel that there is There's so many
[SPEAKER_04]: ways, you know to cultivate and to
cultivate high quality product I just want
[SPEAKER_04]: to have a solution that works for some
people and works well, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe that there is one
fertilizer that solves everything
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's problem if there was everyone
would produce the same exact thing or
[SPEAKER_00]: there would only be one company and it's
not that it's not the case and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's also different demands right as
far as what customers want a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent and what people are willing to pay
and there's so yeah, there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: price points for everybody and there's
different quality products and what one
[SPEAKER_00]: person considers quality is different than
what another person and different markets
[SPEAKER_00]: to like Oregon as opposed to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think those are two different
markets Instagram has a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I think some of its bad to
like people people want it to look a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain way and sometimes they're like
Well, that's not good because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look right and sometimes the ugly weed is
the best 100% magazine weed and all of a
[SPEAKER_07]: sudden it's like where's that flavor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those ugly ducklings can just be
absolutely packed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the best batches of cannabis
I've ever had have never been the ultra
[SPEAKER_04]: dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always like a little bit spaced out a
little bit, you know, nothing that would
[SPEAKER_04]: indicate an unhealthy plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's definitely not hardball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never the hardball has never been flavor,
especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything those bracts get pushed
together and everything's so tight and
[SPEAKER_00]: then, you know, I just feel like it takes
away from the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, takes away from the flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I think there's even,
you know, speaking of flavor, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot to be looked at in that
regard, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How the physical structure of the plant
leads to a better combustion and therefore
[SPEAKER_04]: a better flavor experience, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how much lipids are present in a
strain and how the combustion of those
[SPEAKER_04]: lipids can create an unpleasant or a
pleasant experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much that we need to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all talk about turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the talk about esters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can talk about thiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about, I mean, I guess the new
term is flavorance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the abstracts tech, they released
a bunch of white papers on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're breaking down the different
flavorants and thiles and how they break
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's great when companies
start going after that information.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is flavorance a technical term now that's
being used?
[SPEAKER_07]: It is now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So abstracts tech.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I reposted some stuff that
they've had, but I think it falls under
[SPEAKER_00]: the category of thiles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are smaller molecules, sulfur based
compounds.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sulfur based compounds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and that's what gives the skunk
it's skunky smell and the gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gassy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, some of the like ammonia,
I'm sure that's where the ammonia comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be nitrate based.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, even the citrus, not all of it
comes from terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they have, there's a good
explanation, much better than I can
[SPEAKER_00]: explain right now, but like, yeah,
well, I'll post it up on the screen so
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody can check it out, but it's
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love when companies are just trying
to take it to that next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, with research and
development, you go in a direction and you
[SPEAKER_00]: hope to get a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you don't get the result
you're looking for and you have to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was seeing the thing on Dyson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made, I think 5,000 inferior copies
before he made his first vacuum,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The real one that everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was hanging from a nail just before he
broke through, like mortgage his house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like then all of a sudden he cracked the
code.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sometimes that's what it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes not giving up, falling down,
getting back up, you know, as many times
[SPEAKER_00]: as it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's a mindset too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, part of the mindset is knowing
that just because your experiment didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: prove what it set out to prove doesn't
mean that it was a failure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the mindset, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: As did you learn something, then it's not
a failure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then now you just have more information
direction on where to go next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of data collection is
data points that you can compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the more data points you have,
the more you can understand something,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a cultivar and you want to
know how it performs under this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstance, uh, in this environment,
you know, the more information you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better you can make decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your educated guest becomes that much more
educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of this hinges on data
collection, discipline, data collection,
[SPEAKER_04]: organized and being able to make an
observation off of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at the end of the day,
as a scientist, what you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_04]: is make an observation in the most
calculated, informed way possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so like seeing what you're doing
out, you know, out here with 57 data
[SPEAKER_04]: points per seedling, James, that's so
cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's what's necessary to
move everything forward and to get as much
[SPEAKER_00]: data as possible, you know, and then as
far as for breeding, the more data you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, the better you can make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then over multiple generations
when we're doing inbreeding, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we know what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's stuff that I guess I I've been to
be able to train everybody to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm doing a lot of it,
but, uh, you know, we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: phenome one, uh, from phenome networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a software program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have phenotype, which you'll be able
to take your iPad out in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to go through those 50 data
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them, but like, cause some of
them are like, we're measuring the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: how fast it grows at week one and
measuring it, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the software that's going to be
available or is available now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cheap, but it is amazing,
especially for breeding and then field
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we use here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we're a hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have other locations and we're going
to be taking those locations, collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: data, how it performs in, in one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we look at how it performs in
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also one seed crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at the whole seed crop rather
than just one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do a whole bunch of really
interesting stuff, you know, especially I
[SPEAKER_00]: do auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not keeping any of those alive
in clone form or tissue culture as of yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to get the data on the whole
field, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can, we can look at it and
then we can get averages.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for your typical pheno hunts,
how many cultivars are you working and,
[SPEAKER_07]: or how many different phenos are you doing
at any given time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on what we're doing,
whether it's, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like to go through a hundred
sometimes, but I, if I know the line
[SPEAKER_00]: really well, I don't need a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I find 20, I'm going to
find what I'm looking for in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that I work and some of the things
that we do, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in those instances, you know,
and is it going to be for a field
[SPEAKER_00]: application?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I trying to sell seeds of this or am I
trying to sell a phenotype?
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if I'm trying to sell a clone of it,
I don't keep that seed start alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even pheno hunt that I get rid of
it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if it's stuff that we plan on
licensing, what we do is we get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone start completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I clone it and then we grow the clone
out and we start our pheno hunt from that
[SPEAKER_00]: point, because there's no point in looking
at something that you're not going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, you know, it's like,
let's just get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We save time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're starting with something that
gives us an actual picture of what the end
[SPEAKER_00]: product is going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now if I was going to take and sell
30,000 seeds to a farmer of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making feminized seeds that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know what happens in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just throw out those seed starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to grow them out and see what they
do outside.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growing it indoors doesn't really
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we want to know intersex expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it doesn't, it doesn't cause it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I sell 30,000 seeds, how many herms do
we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the percentage?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, or if you, you know, we can't hunt
that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we do a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get one out of a hundred?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get two out of a hundred?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but the more you work with,
especially at scale, the better picture
[SPEAKER_00]: you get of what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from climate to climate, you can have
two completely different results.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a certain percentage of herms
that you feel is acceptable when you're
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about that larger denominator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like with auto flowers, I feel like one
in a thousand is very acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and then one, one in a 2000
or 3000, you might find a full blown male
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also depends on the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have like, if you have soil that's
not properly amended and that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a area that's extremely hot or
extremely cold, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor cold specifically, specifically,
you know, but like, and that, that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you, the Herm is, I mean, obviously people
aren't growing a thousand seeds indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically they're going to do clone,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But outdoor where people do grow from
seed, I think, especially with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, like one in a thousand is very
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then the more stress type
scenarios are going to cause more herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get more intersex
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, you stress the plant out
and you're going to cause whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, whether it's fluctuations,
uh, whether it's nutrition, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many variables that can cause
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then same thing with photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing is, is like feminized
people think a lot of times, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, feminized have more of a chance of
intersex expressions for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that not to be the case in most
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they, it can be bred in or bred
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's patients and sometimes I
will release stuff in seed form that has
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mike from exotic, cause I was very
adamant.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of exotic gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was very adamant about not
selling anything that had any intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions till I talked to Mike and Mike
convinced me otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, well, out of all this stuff
you've popped, have you kept anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them expressed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, some of the best stuff out
there has intersex expression at herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have 10 seeds and two of them
herm, but eight of them don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you find the winner in that,
who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you let, you know, I feel like,
for me, it's like awareness, letting
[SPEAKER_00]: people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We run a bunch of his stuff and some of
our favorite cuts of his, they do herm
[SPEAKER_07]: periodically and we just accept it because
it's so fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there's some stuff that his stuff is
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rainbow cakes is one of our favorites and
it just herms his red runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had any problems with herms,
but his red runs is something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really liked the red pop,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I liked the red pop that then the
smoke was a little bit of a letdown,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple punch is a little disappointing to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I love the way it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not amazing, but it's not,
it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you go to smoke a joint of it and
you light it up and the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just, it doesn't taste like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get like the hay taste and it's like,
might as well smoke tobacco, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I just, I get more enjoyment out
of tobacco than I do out of smoking purple
[SPEAKER_00]: punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that red pop, it has the, all the
beauty that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets that runs in there with,
so, so the red pop is sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red pop is like a, so it tastes like
cherry cola.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the one that the poppin bottles is
from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that, or is that different?
[SPEAKER_07]: Poppin bottles is one that we're just,
you know, hunting right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just, I, I don't, I don't keep all
the crosses in my brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't have that encyclopedia,
but poppin bottles is one of the new ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he has some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like code red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're running code.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got, we're harvesting code red next
week.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coders got to be in that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red pop was good, but it was, it's like,
it's like I say, like all these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's purple punch or Oreos or
whatever it is, these are all like Apple
[SPEAKER_00]: fritters is another one for me,
but they're all one step away from being
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, you know, or, or two steps or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't mean that flavor component
could be, it's just missing one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might need to cross it something
and then go through the selection process
[SPEAKER_00]: and find a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's so frustrating about phenol
hunting is you've got the boxes that you
[SPEAKER_07]: need to have checked yield potency flavor,
you know, how do they grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: All those boxes need to be checked.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to fold it into a program.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so frustrating when you get to
that finish line, it's like all the boxes
[SPEAKER_07]: are checked, but one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you go to the end and you're like the
one you're like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody goes to smoke it and
they're like, that's not the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it happens more than it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where like the ones that on the plant,
you're like, oh, we got the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the new, new latest and greatest
high.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be the one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, and once you cure it up,
you're like, wait, what happened?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where was all that flavor that we had
there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the look even, you're like,
how does it look like this?
[SPEAKER_04]: When it looked like that on the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's genetic math, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like trying to predict the
Plinko, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's well, it just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the, the breeding is it's the
long game, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the long game and it's all game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all patients, especially the phenol
hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause anybody can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the hard part.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a grind.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a minimum of a year to get something
into production for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we always think about when we
get something going.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then we get everything in TC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have it backed up in TC so that our
nurses can just pop it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just so impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really solid with TC and he does
mirror stem TC, which is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: most companies do nodal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like when we're pulling it out
of mirror stem, I'm very confident that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's clean and we're not going to have
something come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we look, when you look at tissue
culture as a great solution for that,
[SPEAKER_07]: one of the, you know, we haven't moved
into that yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, and I feel like we're late to the
party on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the, what, what are we looking at
in terms of cost when it comes to actually
[SPEAKER_07]: making that part of your SOP?
[SPEAKER_07]: At a farm, at a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you can build a lab for
less than a hundred thousand dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're looking at an employee,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a skilled employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you live is what's
going to dictate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have somebody like Justin,
we can hire a tech that's $35 an hour in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bay area, maybe less up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, if you have a Justin or
someone that's on that level, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys can, can range anywhere from a
hundred to whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so let me understand sort of the two
levels here.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is what you're talking about is
actually building out a room at your
[SPEAKER_07]: facility that ultimately is a designated
TC room, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then what about subbing that out?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there, is there a concept there where
we clean genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we take like, let's say you have stuff
coming in and let's say you pop it from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the beauty of that where you're
pheno hunting it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pop it from seed, you keep it clean,
you keep it in a pretty sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, as sterile as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do nodal on that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can put it in Meristem as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get it back right away in
nodal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes through Meristem and then
banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that costs any, you know, I mean,
we charge $5,500 for genetic, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: per genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the thing is, is like,
you build up your library of your
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anytime you need it out,
you get a clean copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, and so that's the main upside
is that you've got to get a clean copy
[SPEAKER_07]: that's banked that ultimately you can call
on whenever you need it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is that really it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it takes a few months to get out
of culture if it's in Meristem,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're storing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also just have like a small
lab that doesn't cost $100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a small place where you can
basically have your own stuff coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of culture where you can do a lot of that
stuff yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think the Meristem part is
hard because I don't know anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: that does it like we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're blessed to, to have this
as a, you know, a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people that say they
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing is like, there's other
people in the industry that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this, this, and this show me your
COAs, show me your test results from
[SPEAKER_00]: before with Hopladen and Hopladen clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see it after you've cleaned it
every three months for, for, let me show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can show you guys ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Justin can show you three
months, six months, nine months,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 months, 18 months.
[SPEAKER_05]: After and with clean results, you know,
and is that something that is part of your
[SPEAKER_05]: SOPs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a testing every three months?
[SPEAKER_05]: He is costing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's testing every three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that part, and then just to clean,
I mean, the cleaning costs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: our costs to actually do it is,
is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you figure all the man hours
that it takes, you know, the media,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the, all the time and effort that goes
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cheap to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nobody else really doing the
solution correct that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the tricky parts is I understand it
is you can do a good enough job where the
[SPEAKER_04]: viral load is so low that it won't test
for a while, but after a given amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: time, that viral load is going to come
back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from my understanding, the way that
Justin does it, like there is no viral
[SPEAKER_04]: load.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's taking undifferentiated cells,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's taking a cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like peeling the onion back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the vascular, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond the vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taken that undifferentiated cells,
growing the plant from on a cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's not coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is like conception.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like I'm friends with those guys
over conception.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friends with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people don't like me, but I like
everybody pretty much and conception.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're doing a really good job,
but they don't, they don't fuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, if it has hoplite,
they don't want to mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not, they've seen, they've,
they've done RNG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even try to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has hoplite and they don't want to
mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they basically won't put it in the
system because I believe they've had it
[SPEAKER_00]: come back.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why would they waste their time
and energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think they're, they're,
they're a good company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think right now in the TC space,
there's still a, just a general lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: education as to what's actually happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why a lot of people don't
understand the differentiation between the
[SPEAKER_04]: different levels of TC.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people don't really understand
how much skill is involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: In doing it appropriately, like how much
actual physical skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you can do mirror STEM at
home, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but a lot of people do a lot of
people are like, I'm going to go take this
[SPEAKER_00]: class over this weekend or this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to pay whatever the amount
of money is, and I'm going to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do mirror STEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I, I'm one of those guys who's
like, if he can do it, I could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically am like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Justin, we were in Seattle at house
of cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing some stuff up there with my
partners up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a TC lab and they're
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Justin's like, well, you want to learn
how to do mirror STEM?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they got me under the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized for one thing that I'm,
my hands are too shaky, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, I drink a lot of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have as steady of a hand as I
would like, especially for stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're looking under a microscope
and it doesn't look like my hands are
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking at all, but like you get it under
a microscope and there's just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, these guys surgical surgical
surgical on a molecular level.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it surgical, but it's on
the smallest of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting because it
sounds like we're just around the corner
[SPEAKER_07]: from the robot arm going in there and
doing that process where it's like a ton
[SPEAKER_04]: of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a robot arm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have the robot arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, so wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's not for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, but it's four TC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four TC, but it's not for the mirror
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it helps mirror stem excisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to do it on yourself,
but it, it transfers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll transfer the vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not contaminating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it speeds up productivity because
you're not touching the actual vessels
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean tissue culture and then a
lot of people just, they don't fully
[SPEAKER_00]: understand tissue culture and what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, most people don't know what sterile
means.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't even working under a
differentiation between disinfecting and
[SPEAKER_04]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think most people could talk
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one is like, people don't
even, they think 91% alcohol is better
[SPEAKER_00]: than 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the biggest confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are like, Oh, I want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's probably, it's going to clean
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is it's great for your bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 90% is great for your bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for soaking scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're cleaning your scissors off,
but for sterilizing surfaces, 70% is
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the contact time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put it on there and you want a
longer contact time, because that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill more things, except for hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to use it for alcohol,
alcohol or alcohol for hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually stabilizes the Vero.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easier to transfer because of how it
interacts with the coding of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: of the actual virus, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of coagulates them and makes it
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely, you think alcohol and
then you're like, Oh man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need specialized bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think so much of this stuff is
counterintuitive, whether it's breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: or whether it's like viruses and Veroids,
like we think we understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, you know,
enough to make yourself dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you're dangerous and you're
spreading the virus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, that happens all the time with
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, we figured out,
we're just going to soak all the scissors
[SPEAKER_00]: in alcohol in between cuts and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, that doesn't,
that doesn't do it, but it sounds like it
[SPEAKER_04]: would, but it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, I think there's a lot of
Dunning Krueger still in this kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: where, you know, a lot of people don't
know how much they don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they learn a tiny little bit and
they're like, Oh, easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little pathogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got to soak my, I just got to soak
my scissors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it wasn't even that it was like a
year ago at an event, not going to name
[SPEAKER_04]: the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our new cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool thing about this gel is got alcohol
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need to clean your scissors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go ahead and dip all the cups,
all the cuts right in this one bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to worry because the
alcohol is going to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, please, please don't ever
say that to any customer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, there's still a, just a giant
lapse in education.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've always kind of felt in a
weird place in this industry because I do
[SPEAKER_04]: have a formal education and I know a lot
of people don't and I've never been one to
[SPEAKER_04]: hold that against someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a firm believer.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of different types of
intelligence, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that book smart is only one small part
of being like an intelligent human being,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's emotional intelligence,
kinesthetic intelligence, street
[SPEAKER_04]: intelligence, street intelligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's common sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a natural common sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I do look forward to this
industry becoming a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: data-driven and making decisions based on
evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I say individuals like yourself,
like taking actual steps to make that a
[SPEAKER_04]: reality, like I'm so grateful because I
know that a lot of people are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: take that information, run with it and
make this industry better for everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we're all piggybacking on
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're standing on the shoulders of
giants, especially in the breeding world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this stuff was done in the,
the early stuff was done in the sixties
[SPEAKER_00]: and seventies for modern cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, land race stuff has been
done for hundreds of years all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we hybridized this stuff in
California in the sixties and seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really piggybacking on those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, let's take this,
cross it with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I feel like real
breeding was done back then to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's starting to be done
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people out there that are doing a
really good job at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of people that are
just like, let's just cross this with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of times this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's just the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just in breeding and you don't
understand your injury.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are some of your current favorite
breeders that are doing it out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing it the way Jackson is probably one
of my favorites, uh, mean gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, uh, my, my buddy,
Nick, Nick Stromberg, I think he's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's, what's the, what's the,
the, he's, people don't even know who he
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's one of those guys who's just
doing it and doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the guys I look up to,
I think at one point, he might've looked
[SPEAKER_00]: up to me and now I'm the guy looking up to
him like, dude, this guy's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Fletch, I think he's doing a great
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think there's,
there's a bunch of people doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kind of everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I just, I think going back to
some of the land race is not a bad way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing some experiments with land race
genetics, um, taking a step back,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also just thoroughly testing
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's super important and phenom
really doing phenons, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not just about making seeds
and about hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, although understanding what's in that
pack in that cross and understanding your
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: One way to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you need to have like a
six month plan, a one year plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: a five year plan, you know, and,
and mine, a lot of what I'm doing is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of legacy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I see like the end in the distant
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't see it tomorrow,
but I know that like, I only have so much
[SPEAKER_00]: time left to do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my book out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that was a step in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the breeding stuff I want to
do is, you know, it's a 10 year project
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is like, literally it's a 10 year
project to do some of the exciting stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't share all of that with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some stuff that I keep for
myself, but, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I like, you know,
my soul fire, he's doing some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, him and Mike are pretty
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like a lot of their work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you familiar with the guys over?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about land race.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guys are at a seeds that doing the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were, I featured them some of
their photos in my book.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just about to start, you know,
hunting as animal deck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some Cali China.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember exactly, but the whole
idea is right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So land race.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for, for commercial cultivation,
we can't wait 11, 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need something.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've got, so their whole gag is
we've got land race for you guys to run.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've crossed it with these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to help it finish in nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just about to embark on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, I'm, I'm hyped to hear that you're,
I like ACE.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Khalifa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like my, my book was
written by myself and 22 other people
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed information, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, it wasn't just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a group effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always like group efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like winning with a group of people
is so much more fun than just standing
[SPEAKER_00]: there winning by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like eating alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like one of those guys who enjoys
going to some fancy dinner by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather be with my friends and
celebrating with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and the book is a Testament
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I could have never written some
of that stuff that's in my book on tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole chapter, uh, Justin's,
uh, partner, Matt from apical biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote the chapter on tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale hunt wrote the chapter on IP and
protecting your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's super important
intellectual property and plant protection
[SPEAKER_00]: is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to at least understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not need to do it as a breeder,
but it's great to understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property actually is,
or whether you're creating something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's novel, you know, or whether you're
just trying to steal somebody's cause
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's happened to, you know,
it's like, well, Harvey Richmond,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's one of my friends with his Sage,
like someone else tried to patent his
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that kind of stuff is going
to happen with companies, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you do in that type of a
situation?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that there's a lot of,
protections right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: within, but there will be because it's,
it's already in ag, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we are going to become another ag
commodity just like everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're at the stage where it's
pretty normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at Oregon cannabis is pretty
normalized up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a hundred percent more so than it
is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only going to grow bigger,
bigger, bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movement's gotten stronger and
stronger to the point where it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our two presidential candidates
that are both kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: leading on to believe that they're going
to decriminalize it completely on a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like if they're talking about
it, it's really, you know, it's gaining.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the whole rescheduling,
you know, but baby steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing that it's going to take
some, we might, we might, but I don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: us going backwards in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see other countries maybe going
backwards, like Thailand, which is silly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it's like, they went too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now they're like, take it back a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see it on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at Portugal, you look at Germany,
you look at Uruguay Columbia, Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico is even making leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Vincent, which is medical in the
Caribbean Trinidad, which is fully
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many places Australia's
medical, you know, we just get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: people to understand that it's not bad
that it makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get everybody on board and
that's where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of deprogramming that
we are, and it might take generations,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it took generations to get here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, the deep, the deep
programming that needs to occur in the
[SPEAKER_04]: general population when it comes to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an acceptance and acceptance of
allowing people to do what they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not hurting other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a bad thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the end of the day, it's not causing
lung cancer, like cigarettes, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: causing liver cancer, like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have some psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some things, but it's not
as bad as either one of those two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when you compare it to alcohol,
it's just, it's not even in the same
[SPEAKER_05]: galaxy in terms of the harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would compare it to,
I mean, compared to almost any
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's, it's safety and comparison
is the only thing that's safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's illegal is mushrooms
psychedelics, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're saying that it's safer.
[SPEAKER_07]: The chance for psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, well, no, I mean, you can take
some moments that I wouldn't get behind
[SPEAKER_07]: the wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no problem driving on for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be driving on it,
but I think as far as like safety,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been there too long term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to decriminalize
psychedelics too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they, they actually are beneficial
and can make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cornell with their whole psychedelic
program.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's a lot that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was Johns Hopkins that I was
actually referencing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with MDMA and with psilocybin,
I think both of those are starting to
[SPEAKER_07]: actually become more widely accepted for
their therapeutic effects, helping people
[SPEAKER_04]: get over traumas and unfortunately they
just, they just announced the ban on
[SPEAKER_04]: therapeutic MDMA.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you heard about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said more studies need to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't, yeah, they said that was
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't completely kibosh and they
just said more studies need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understandable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I never thought I'd see this push
in my lifetime, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think psychedelics can make the world
a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had such a crazy attitude shift
within myself, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: From looking at myself in my younger days,
always blaming the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing was ever my fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always angry, sore loser.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just had an experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made me, you know, feel the love of the
earth and realize, Hey man, there's,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a better way to approach life.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a more positive way to approach
life and seeing like what kind of impact
[SPEAKER_04]: that had on myself made me really want to
have other people have like a similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for everybody, but I got to
experience it from a young age,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I believe that like sometimes we go
through life and all these things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced put a filter over us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the world a certain way with all
these filters stacked on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to lift those filters
back and kind of see the world how it
[SPEAKER_00]: really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a beautiful, amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think stress stress is just such a
killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes if you can do, you use some
form of a psychedelic or even cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: get over these stressful things and
realize that they're not as bad as we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a perspective shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's always amazed me right is the power
that it has to impart empathy on people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, as three consumers
of cannabis, I think we all probably feel
[SPEAKER_04]: that if the world was a more empathetic
place, it would be a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that for me is something
that I can't wait to learn more about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have my theory, which is,
I think that like naturally when you
[SPEAKER_04]: consume a psychedelic, you have such a
deeper appreciation for the natural world
[SPEAKER_04]: in your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's just where it comes
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we are all so disconnected,
you know, from what makes being alive so
[SPEAKER_04]: special, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That being forced to kind of appreciate
just pretty colors or I mean, how many
[SPEAKER_00]: people empathy, right, empathy also,
because because we look at the world from
[SPEAKER_00]: our perspective and we don't realize that
everybody has their own view of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at their own lens,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've experienced things differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody has a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where empathy comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you realize that there's other
perspectives than your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I am excited to see more
research coming out, the stigma being
[SPEAKER_04]: broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's one we're still,
I mean, the stigma on hallucinogenics is
[SPEAKER_04]: still, I think, pretty strong because even
amongst my contemporaries, there's still a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of, there's a lot of people that I've
been able to convince, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's still a lot of people that are
just like deathly scared, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and like, I don't, I don't, I don't want
to jump off a hotel balcony.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, that's not, that's not
necessarily what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think fear is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't go into it all willy nilly
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're moving in a good
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're from Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Sonny's from Eugene where he
lives up in Eugene right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone to been going to Eugene for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the food scene up in Eugene,
the breweries up in Eugene, food trucks
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys have some really cool
stuff.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Portland has this beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the food scene, but they do,
but you guys have some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some really good experiences up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was born in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the same thing with the beer scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have your own thing down in
Eugene though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a slower way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that live in Eugene pretty much
love living in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was in SoCal for almost 30
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down to UCLA and when we moved up
to Oregon to the, to the farm,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, 32 acres out in the middle of
farmland, it was just like, I literally
[SPEAKER_07]: felt like I had landed in paradise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I just, it's just, it's beautiful up
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's magic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how'd you get your start in the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so I was down in LA and you know,
I mean, I started growing at UCLA and in a
[SPEAKER_07]: closet, like a lot of, a lot of guys in
college did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people on the show did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So two bedroom apartment, we had two
closets, you know, veg and flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: But my buddy's dad had started a hydro
farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he, you know, he hooked us up with
some gear.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from that moment, I was kind of hooked
in terms of that magic of taking
[SPEAKER_07]: something, you know, like a little clone
and then turning it into finished flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've, I've been, you know,
involved in, in cultivation my whole life.
[SPEAKER_07]: My parents always had like vegetable
gardens and orchards.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was always something that I just
loved doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd been down in LA running a landscape
construction company for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so again, involved with plants,
nurseries, cultivation, and the
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity came for us to move up to
Oregon in 2015.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that summer that we moved up there,
measure 91 had just passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was, you know, it was now a
legal prospect to actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: really develop a solid business.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my wife's an attorney and she thought,
well, you know, if we can actually do this
[SPEAKER_07]: legal beagle, then let's, let's push into
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take all of your background.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take all of your experience and
let's actually, let's, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the farm was, was kind of falling
apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, the, the farm was,
was, you know, it had been in the family
[SPEAKER_07]: for a number of years and was not doing
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not a sustainable model
financially.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the end of the day, you know,
all my years in running businesses,
[SPEAKER_07]: like you have a great business,
but if it doesn't pencil, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: pencil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we wanted first and foremost to create
a sustainable model and save the farm and
[SPEAKER_07]: create something that felt like we could
actually build something meaningful there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 2015, we started doing the build out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just me and, and, and one other
guy, my, my, my best buddy from,
[SPEAKER_07]: from NorCal who came up and helped me get
everything going.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we started with one bedroom and one
flower room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a very humble beginnings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we started with one cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had one cultivar that we launched the
entire farm with, and that was Alpha Blue.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of, so his, his good buddy in
NorCal had, had been breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: And had Alpha Blue, which is New York city
diesel cross with Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we started, and so we say that the
farm is the, you know, sort of the house
[SPEAKER_07]: that Alpha built.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Alpha Blue is our longest running
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our, you know, still to this day,
one of our most popular cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smoked it, but I can imagine
exactly what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just that berry forward flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just, yeah, it's, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so Blue Dream has an amazing
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the apical of structure as far
as it grows really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root system is just amazing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always talked about putting OG Kush
plants and grafting them onto Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was this conversation from 15
years ago or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because OG was so finicky, but like the,
so basically the New York city diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a grapefruit, grapefruit,
like citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nose burn to it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but it grows really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little less dense than Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those two profiles seem like they
would marry really well together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it was killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then he ended up crossing Alpha Blue
with a bunch of other crosses that we
[SPEAKER_07]: launched.
[SPEAKER_07]: We, we folded into the program.
[SPEAKER_07]: He crossed it with Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: He crossed it with the DJ Short Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had, you know, we had our,
you know, our whole lineup was sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: founded on Alpha Blue in the early days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there it was just literally
just one room at a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each harvest paid for the next upgrade,
paid for the next, paid for the next.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just iterated from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like a little bit of the
competitive advantage early days was just
[SPEAKER_07]: that I was focused on developing a
sustainable business, not just growing
[SPEAKER_07]: great weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, you know, and, and sort of,
for me, like cultivation, if you look at
[SPEAKER_07]: the, at the, the definition of
cultivation, right, the first definition
[SPEAKER_07]: you find is of course around plants and
cultivating things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the second definition is skill
acquisition or acquiring knowledge or
[SPEAKER_07]: qualities, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the fusion for me, for my entire
life has been cultivating, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it's been music or sports or,
you know, whatever it's cultivating and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's cultivating something at the highest
possible level that you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me, a lot of the driver was just
like, if we're going to do this,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to run cultivars that nobody
else has.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do it in a way that nobody
else is doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nobody had LEDs at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2015, Fluence was just emerging with
their LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated the purples, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The blurples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fluence came out with this amazing
light and people were scared to use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so Jerry, one of the founders of
Fluence flew out to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was making a few stops, trying to get
people on board for this tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he showed up, plugged in the first
light and it blew me away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not the purple party lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an actual legit, like powerful
fixture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the time, you know, I, I talked to
a few people about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, you're fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like LEDs are not ready for prime time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be, you know, like,
are you going to get three pounds of
[SPEAKER_07]: light?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, it was that whole
mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so far ahead of their time
because everybody was scared to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was like done with LEDs at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd seen some of my friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of my friends grew with those and
would, you know, however, he's really
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of what they've grown or what
they're growing and they want to bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: over to their spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you got to be kidding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just the yield in 500 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was like nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so that was it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we really were just like focused
on, on really trying to do something
[SPEAKER_07]: different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I felt like with the LEDs,
we were going to define ourselves in a
[SPEAKER_07]: different way and we weren't going to be
running hydro, which is again,
[SPEAKER_07]: totally fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have nothing against coke or hydro,
but I was a focus on soil and LEDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was, that was how I wanted to run
the program.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we've been doing for
almost 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried under canopy yet?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so there's, there's two things that,
that, you know, you can sort of never have
[SPEAKER_07]: enough of in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's, I guess, several things,
but, but one of them are in indoor
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation or amps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you run out of amps, it turns out,
like you just like, no matter how many
[SPEAKER_07]: amps you think you need, double it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have, you know, multiple,
multiple 600 amp drops and we just ended
[SPEAKER_07]: up, you know, going through it as just
quick as you possibly could.
[SPEAKER_07]: So under canopy lighting from a,
from an amp perspective, and from a
[SPEAKER_07]: logistical perspective to outfit every one
of our seven flower rooms with under
[SPEAKER_07]: canopy lighting, it's just like,
I literally don't have the power to run
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the idea of actually setting up under
canopy lighting, I know people having
[SPEAKER_07]: great success with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not something that we have,
have embarked on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like, you know, maybe the return is
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the, I don't know what
the numbers say in terms of the return on
[SPEAKER_07]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but you need to get one and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only, and the only reason we
haven't, it's sort of like, you just need
[SPEAKER_07]: to try heroin one time just to see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't actually want to try it one
time to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so that's been the mindset with a lot
of the stuff that we've done is like,
[SPEAKER_07]: if it works, like let's run bio biz,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, great.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to cost $8 million a month to
run a commercial facility on bio biz.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to see what the results
are going to be because I just,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just not going to pencil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's been tough for me to get on
the under canopy lighting train just
[SPEAKER_07]: because I don't have the amps or the
appetite to try to, to, to, to manage
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure that there are cats that are
using it and it's working well and it
[SPEAKER_07]: probably does pencil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have such, we've got six different
pre-roll lines in our lineup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we love bee buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so, so a lot of that lower stuff
that just doesn't develop because I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: have the under canopy lighting or the,
the, the PPFD down there is just too low
[SPEAKER_07]: for those lower nugs to develop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have nice turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got no issue with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I need those bee buds,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're always chasing more bee buds to
continue to feed those pre-roll lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, are you grading yours
with the screen and then separating them
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do you guys do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, every trim cycle, every cultivar
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got certain strains like our grease
cookies that we found in our, in our,
[SPEAKER_07]: in our monkey berries hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we run a strawberries and cream out of
grease cookies and that grease cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can practically trim every single nug
on that just because it's so dense.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're definitely big in defoliation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we, we try to, you know, we do a week
three and a week six default.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to make sure that we're getting
that good penetration down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, with, with what we get out
of the Fluence fixtures we're averaging
[SPEAKER_07]: 12, 1300 PPFD across the tops of the
canopy and we're getting good penetration
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's just been, it's just been a
process of, of iterating and evolving and
[SPEAKER_07]: chasing always, I mean, it drives my team
nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just literally relentlessly
experimenting, just constantly trying new
[SPEAKER_07]: things and seeing how we can improve.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how we, that's how we got onto
the beanstalk drain is because I felt like
[SPEAKER_07]: there was a way to get fertility,
to go with the biology that we knew was
[SPEAKER_07]: critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with all the compost teas and some of
the different, the photo P photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_07]: plus, we're a big fan of that armory.
[SPEAKER_07]: We run armory.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're, we're big into ensuring that
all the fungal bacterial load in that soil
[SPEAKER_07]: is optimized to cycle those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I knew that the fertility side of
things could be more efficient and
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, and that's why we've been
experimenting with beanstalk now for five
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we went through a phase where we
started it at a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the big challenges,
and I would say to anyone who's interested
[SPEAKER_07]: in trying the beanstalk, 110% try it,
but be mindful of a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're running in soil in the same way
that you're talking about the tissue
[SPEAKER_07]: culture testing every three months as part
of that SOP, you have to soil test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single round that gets loaded into
our rooms, we run a soil test with Logan
[SPEAKER_07]: labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 65 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you not want to know every
single time what the composition of your
[SPEAKER_07]: soil is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan labs is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love Logan labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out Logan labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, I think that part of our
process was understanding, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: what our bulk soil was, was like cycle to
cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: How could we continue to stoke that
fertility and how can we do it in a way
[SPEAKER_07]: that makes sense?
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we first started running the
beanstalk, we were running it at a hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were running all the lines,
the fortify, the K boost, the absolute
[SPEAKER_07]: flower running V basis and veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we weren't minding the store with
regular soil testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw our salinity start to climb.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as we, as soon as we noticed it,
we were like, oh shit, like the salinity
[SPEAKER_07]: is a bit out of whack.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you have to be mindful of soil
testing and, and monitoring salinity
[SPEAKER_07]: levels, monitoring everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but certainly when you're running a
salt based, a mineral based input like
[SPEAKER_07]: that, you do need to be, you need to keep
an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do reuse your soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not reusing your soil,
it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that pencil is better for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got a bulk vendor up there that,
I mean, we, at this point we've got over a
[SPEAKER_07]: hundred yards of soil on the farm and we
just mix 15 yard batches at a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We re-amend with dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_07]: We bring more biochar to the party,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're constantly cycling that soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are testing and testing and testing
to make sure that the composition of that
[SPEAKER_07]: soil is what we really are looking for
when we load in a room.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we started working with Beanstalk,
we ran the RX that they had laid out for
[SPEAKER_07]: us and it worked great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we saw it just absolutely heroic
yields just cycle after cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: The yields were absolutely through the
roof.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of, one of, you know, my,
my current garden manager, shout out
[SPEAKER_07]: Morgan is, you know, one of the,
you know, pickiest motherfuckers when it
[SPEAKER_07]: comes to flavor of smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's all about running shit in organic
soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Medium like that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No salts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and when we started,
you know, experiment with the Beanstalk,
[SPEAKER_07]: we kind of lost him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just was no longer passionate about the
grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just lost his, his mojo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really disheartening for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really frustrating to see that
he had no longer really, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: committed in the way that he was before
when it was just compost teas and dry
[SPEAKER_07]: amendments that we were scratching in
every round.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we started doing the Pepsi
challenge every single harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single cultivar.
[SPEAKER_07]: And which one did he end up picking over
and over again?
[SPEAKER_07]: The one room with beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so all of a sudden he's like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a hybrid model actually is kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that is what ultimately sold him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is what sells anyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes to experimenting,
you have to see it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to try it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to then taste it and you have to
see, does this meet my standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause on paper it can look completely
different where you're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: well this, or you have the mindset that it
has to be 100% organic and I only want an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anything else because
organics the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plants don't fucking care.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to tell you right now,
they need what they need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if, if, if what they need is not
there, go ahead and let me know how your
[SPEAKER_07]: garden looks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So part of it for us is the way that we
think about being stocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we started doing is we started
doing a 33%, a 66% on a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_07]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just started playing around with
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started running just absolute flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started running absolute flour with,
with, with KBoost.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we started running every conceivable
combination we could at every conceivable
[SPEAKER_07]: dosing that we could.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we found is this hybrid model
represents essentially a perfect insurance
[SPEAKER_07]: policy for an organic soil based approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that the fertility is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that the biology is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the plants need it, it's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they don't need it, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: But our, our, our by far best harvest and
it's, you know, cultivar to cultivar,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to find differences,
but for the most part, our sweet spot is
[SPEAKER_07]: basically a half dose of that RX in the
absolute flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is, that's the home run for us when
we run flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: We, there are certain cultivars that love
that extra potassium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the KBoost really does play a great
role.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some are heavy feeders, some are
lighter feeders.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you talk about, we talked about a
moment ago that it takes about a year to
[SPEAKER_07]: phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about getting to know, so once you
found that pheno, you're all excited about
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead and factor in another year or
more or more.
[SPEAKER_07]: To then go, okay, so more light,
less light, more food, less food,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that plant changes in that first
year, it changes a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to settle out somewhere
between the first year and the second year
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it has that same expression every
time you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause so, you know, between the first
colonial generation, second colonial,
[SPEAKER_00]: third, fourth, there can be changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's drastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most drastic is from seed to that
first colonial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the first colonial to the fourth
colonial, it can, it can change slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: over time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that, you know, at the end of
the day, you know, everyone wants heavy
[SPEAKER_07]: yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anyone would say,
no, I don't want heavy yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants those turps in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants that potency, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, the beanstalk fertilizer
represents a really, really effective way
[SPEAKER_07]: to ensure that your fertility program is
on point because we're managing,
[SPEAKER_07]: in our busy season, we're managing
somewhere around 7,000 plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, you know, for some grows,
that might be nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: For other people, that might sound like a
huge number.
[SPEAKER_07]: For us, it's daunting as fuck because you
can't have, you know, 50 people on staff
[SPEAKER_07]: managing those plants and expect to have
your margins make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you're running as lean a team as you
possibly can in order to, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure that everything's being taken
care of.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fertility program that you run has
to pencil and it's got to be something
[SPEAKER_07]: that, from a labor perspective,
is extremely efficient.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we ran beanstalk for quite a
while and then we stopped to see if,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, okay, if we actually were just,
you know, redoubled our efforts with,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, top dressing and dry amendments
and we redoubled our efforts on this
[SPEAKER_07]: organic approach, maybe we can pull it
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just, it's just so hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just trying to land a, you know,
like a rocket on a fraction when you're
[SPEAKER_07]: running that program at commercial scale
with that many plants, that many moving
[SPEAKER_07]: parts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just too damn hard, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's got their own take on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you're looking for something that
ultimately works and pencils and works for
[SPEAKER_07]: your team, the beanstalk is the way that
we have found, and we call it our hybrid
[SPEAKER_07]: model, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the mother mag hybrid model.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's running really great soil that's
absolutely loaded with, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: fungal and bacterial dominant biology.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you just, the fertility is taken
care of.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't stress about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just works.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's been our story with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to add that Tom is actually
currently doing a lot of work on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_04]: on his own personal channel, kind of
taking people through how he actually uses
[SPEAKER_04]: the product, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone after the podcast is
interested into delving into a more
[SPEAKER_04]: granular pun, maybe intended there.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, the Mother Magnolia Cultivation
YouTube channel is brand new.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've only got, I think, about 12 videos
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But part of it is just the passion of
talking about, you know, these different
[SPEAKER_07]: things that we work on from these
different products to, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: lighting, all the different things that go
into cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're trying to, we're trying to find
a sweet spot where this, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the nexus of, of, of cultivation,
you know, really is something that people
[SPEAKER_07]: can connect with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I, I firmly believe that,
you know, we're all cultivating,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, cool things in our lives.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's, you know, got their thing that
they're cultivating, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That, that, that list is, is almost
limitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relationships.
[SPEAKER_07]: Relationships, creativity, cooking,
whatever, health and wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's so much that goes into,
you know, a day to day, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation program.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to ultimately use actual
cultivation as a place for people to
[SPEAKER_07]: understand that that mindfulness,
that intentionality, that focus,
[SPEAKER_07]: that discipline, that relentless
persistence, through the resistance that
[SPEAKER_07]: you get when you're trying to cultivate
actual plants, where bugs are trying to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, hijack your crops and all of the
different challenges that go into it is a
[SPEAKER_07]: direct correlate to, to life and
everything that you're trying to actually
[SPEAKER_07]: work on in your life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can use a garden as a place to
work on those different skills,
[SPEAKER_07]: they are transferable skills, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as like the industry,
I mean, what's your opinion on going to
[SPEAKER_00]: school to learn how to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, so this is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we've talked about it with other
people and I, as a chef went to culinary
[SPEAKER_00]: school, but I don't think other people
should go to culinary school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, cause cooking is a
mentorship skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to learn how to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a mentor type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best experience is a mentor type
experience where you have, where you've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned from somebody who's learned from
somebody else and they put their own
[SPEAKER_00]: touches on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it teaches you direct transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the garden is the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the best way is to go work as
a water boy or whatever it is you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to learn, go grow at home,
go, go work for somebody, go water their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they like you, they'll teach you some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't like you, they'll fire you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that, again, that hybrid
model is exactly it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it yourself, go dig it out of the dirt
yourself, figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then where you're, if you're really
passionate about it and you really want to
[SPEAKER_07]: pursue it further, a hundred percent,
you got to get tucked under somebody's
[SPEAKER_07]: wing and you got to, you got a shadow and
you got to just, you know, be in those
[SPEAKER_07]: trenches and understand all of the
different nuances that go into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's, you know, at the end of the
day, you know, again, just my opinion,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that cultivation is a really,
really challenging thing to do at a very
[SPEAKER_07]: high level.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really challenging to do at a
very high level.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that tough to just grow plants,
you know, whether it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at a high level with consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: With consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: At scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: At scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: With multiple employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the typical home grower though,
who's just ultimately, Hey, I just want to
[SPEAKER_07]: do three or four plants, whatever,
or maybe just a couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: That in and of itself is not just a
giveaway.
[SPEAKER_07]: That in and of itself will have a lot of
challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think something like this is absolutely
a killer solution for the home grower who
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't work on nine to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simplicity, yeah, I think a lot of times
if you start simple, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to overcomplicate it,
that's where you go wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be some core sort of
major through lines, whether it's for home
[SPEAKER_07]: grow or at scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that ultimately you just have
to be in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to actually do it day in and day
out, like any skill, like anything,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooking, learning guitar.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you really want to take it to a really
elevated level, where you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivate that skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to be great, if you want
to be great, it takes a lot more.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm hoping for our YouTube channel is
that we can sort of throw our iron in the
[SPEAKER_07]: fire, give our perspective about what
cultivating, our style of cultivation in
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon, on our farm, how we run it,
hoping that we can actually learn from
[SPEAKER_07]: other people that actually come into that
community.
[SPEAKER_07]: That have comments already, just in the
first three, four weeks of posting videos.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten great comments and great
feedback from people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, damn, that's another way of
doing it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many different paths to that
mountaintop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that by actually just sharing
what we've learned over the last 10 years
[SPEAKER_07]: of cultivating cannabis at scale,
I'm hoping that we're going to learn more
[SPEAKER_07]: as we actually share that information that
becomes sort of this great feedback loop
[SPEAKER_07]: where we can share what we've learned and
then we can learn from other people that
[SPEAKER_07]: are saying, you know, this is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what works for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The community aspect as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think that's at the end of the
day, the ecosystem up in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's super, super tight knit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are some phenomenal growers up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to give my boy- You have different
genetics up there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have completely different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the dispensary, I see all kinds of
stuff that we don't see in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see more sativa, you know, definitely
more sativa and more stuff that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think there's more diversity
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's always been, I feel like we,
back in 1997, I grew the Oregon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't DJ shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the spear plants that grew really
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a three blueberries that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Oregon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the DJ short blueberry,
which was a short plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a one that was from
Canada, the Canada blueberry, which my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend just gave me some of, which was
good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why our blueberry short stack
is currently on ice and not in our lineup
[SPEAKER_07]: because the plant structure was such a
motherfucker to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, in production and the yields
were just not great.
[SPEAKER_07]: The flower, it's some of the absolute best
flower that we have ever grown full stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people absolutely hit us up on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, when are you going to bring back the
blueberry?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few cultivars like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields finishes quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: The seeds are pretty homogenous to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, but the cut, the cut,
the clone is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, then this is why we wouldn't do
that is because there's blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like your model.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then it's like, from our perspective,
it's a strain game as a producer up in
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a competitive market and there's
people that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a high level that we don't want
to be growing something that somebody else
[SPEAKER_07]: has.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to have to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yours are all exclusive pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either Fino hunted them or?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's clearly going to be some overlaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not growing Yeager.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like the exotic stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we feel like we were early to the
exotic party and that other growers
[SPEAKER_07]: started seeing our exotic gear that we
were posting on Instagram and putting out
[SPEAKER_07]: in the shops.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we started seeing exotic slowly
start percolating through the ecosystem up
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is that you have to be
really careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at some point, if you've got a strain
that you're loving and that's working
[SPEAKER_07]: really well and then all of a sudden two,
three other people start running it,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's probably time to go ahead and
retire that and move on to something new.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's a really competitive
market up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the SoCal market,
the California market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Runts, lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Runts, Runts called 10 different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still Runts, lemon cherry gelato
called 10 or 20, 30 different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still the same thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, I went ahead and I wanted to
just, you know, have a quick, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: rundown of some of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: My brain does not function the way that
yours does when it comes to genetics and
[SPEAKER_07]: keeping all the different strain names.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of the guilt that I was talking
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't not keep them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the nineties in Oregon,
we got stuff from Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the four-way snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had the dog, which was chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got it as D-A-W-G was from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They renamed it because it's really D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had the Trinity, which was pretty
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the four-way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the corn and there was the snow,
not the snow cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got, it was the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were the Oregon genetics that I
remember that came down that just blew my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's when I was like, Oregon has
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we had good stuff in the Bay area
too, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Bay area has been an epicenter
for a long time, but yeah, Oregon's done
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting genetics from,
from the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like all the way back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bay area was like a cultural epicenter and
we were kind of hijacking a lot from the
[SPEAKER_04]: PNW.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost, like from a genetic
perspective, from a genetic perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I felt like a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Santa Cruz was like a big
epicenter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Humboldt also, like I think
there's a lot of people that never got
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for their amazing work in Humboldt,
especially like the farmers up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was so many farmers doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we've had guys talking
about generation after generation
[SPEAKER_00]: obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, he's a, I don't know
if you're familiar with obsolete,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan from obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you know, farmers go in
generation to generation, they'd select
[SPEAKER_00]: their best plant and they'd basically
pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would be the seeds for the next
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost like heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's the same concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would do it like, like an ag model
right before we had, before they had
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, even if they were cloned,
that was how they brought out the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and kept them alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the most amazing stuff,
you know, and there was bag seeds and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there was all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of factors and the
Europeans also did a lot of interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not just strain hunters,
the guys, but yeah, strain hunters going
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world, you know, Ben
Dronkers, Ariane Roskam and those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: killing it over at Greenhouse Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good friends with those guys,
but, you know, it's like early days of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys did amazing adventures all over
Simon from serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a true F1 breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a life they must have lived,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just really interesting stories
and amazing genetics and like to take land
[SPEAKER_00]: race genetics and get AK 47 out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like most people, they couldn't even
fathom what it would take to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people it's so far
over their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would really need to understand what
happens with land race genetics and how
[SPEAKER_00]: hard it is to breed with this genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw stuff that's like,
yeah, I mean, just wild that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: never use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of space it would take to
do something properly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the thing that's just so,
you know, so daunting when you,
[SPEAKER_07]: when you look at even phenohunting
regardless.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, breeding is probably like
phenohunting on steroids in terms of the
[SPEAKER_07]: difficulty, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of actually achieving what you're
trying to achieve and the time that it
[SPEAKER_07]: takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of times you have a direction
and you're going this way and you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: over here, but at least you're making
forward progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, you know, it's just, I think that
a lot of it is just, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: people just don't want to spend the time
because it's just so challenging.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's, it's, it's expensive both in
time and money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with no promise that you're
actually going to get what you're
[SPEAKER_07]: basically opening baseball card.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not just, you know, get some cuts
and let's move on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you start to see the,
you know, the homogenous layout of,
[SPEAKER_07]: of, of strain starts to emerge and you get
the purple punch everywhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's going to work for
some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start breeding stuff and crossing
stuff and then you end up with Jack,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like not, and not the good quality
of Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that as a reference, but it's like
the, you know, it all comes, Adam done
[SPEAKER_00]: actually said that originally,
but like you overbreed stuff, you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with Jack, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it all comes back to that turpinoline
limonene and that, that profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Hayes profile, the limonene,
especially that pops out and it's super
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant and not recessive and will eat up
any cool profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross it with anything and it ends up
with that eventually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, trying to, I think, you know,
going back to what you're talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: is, you know, hunting land race,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to, well, I guess what we're really
trying to do there is we're trying to find
[SPEAKER_04]: a new color, a new flavor that's maybe
just been hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a magenta, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I need some period winkle.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an interesting way of looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just trying to find that new something
that's never been seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get excited about, you know,
the most craziest things, uh, fried
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want fried chicken turps, you know,
like that excites me though.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're going through it, we're like,
wow, we smell this or we smell that or
[SPEAKER_00]: translate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we get the Belgian waffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell like Belgian waffles and maple
syrup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and sometimes it doesn't
translate to the smoke on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, our current, uh, top turp is pot roast
inner snow skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's by far the favorite smoke on the,
on the farm and it just smells like
[SPEAKER_07]: straight up pot roast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You open a bag and it's like, that's your
dinty more that you had as a kid or
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should name it Ajou.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a great name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be stealing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certain things and people get
excited about certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in, in the Bay area and in
LA, I think a lot of it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gotta be purple candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gas to check the boxes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it's not candy and it's not purple
in this market, you can have gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, gas is good, but you gotta have
the candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like the evolution of the
purple movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like purple never went
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just turned into candy gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it feels like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went away for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you couldn't sell GDP to save
your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 20 years ago, 15 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010 is more like the GDP kind of went
down to GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 2008, but GDP was on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the guys like Luke Skarmazzo,
he's been on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, he built his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dispensary was built on GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy Myers is the guy he was on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who brought GDP to the
market, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't breed it, but he's the one who
brought it and got it named.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was a point where like,
you couldn't sell it to save your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with cookies, it started making a
company.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super rare to find GDP in the Oregon
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a GDP that's crossed with our
alpha blue that we call Sangria Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to grow real GDP though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the reason why our Sangria Kush is
again on ice, we are going to bring her
[SPEAKER_07]: back in a cyclist just because she's such
a fussy bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just a nightmare to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the A flower that comes off of her is
absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_07]: She checks the potency box.
[SPEAKER_07]: The turps on her is just that loud berry
just blast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's been gone now from our lineup
for over a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were just recently at a big Nectar
party event.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our biggest customer and they're
the largest retailer up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Nectar.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a bunch of the bud tenders hit up the
table like, where's that Sangria Kush?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's that Sangria Kush?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to bring it back.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the grand data purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the magic of that grand data purple
that really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: GDP is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to tell me that GDP is not in
cookies, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cherry pie GDP are almost, they're so,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry pie herms a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: GDP herms a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one I grew was Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the closest I grew to
GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had experience with GDP herming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mostly experience with growing
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually I take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a story where I got seeds from some
guy and I learned early on that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to pheno hunt every batch of seeds you get
from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the first batch, no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second batch and you know, we sold them
under our brand and I learned that you
[SPEAKER_00]: make your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't sell seeds under your brand and
other people have made because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just a cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good, you know, I'm glad it
happened so early on with my brand because
[SPEAKER_00]: if it hadn't happened, who knows down the
road, what would have happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it made good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know, that was 14 years ago,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, or 13 years ago, but it was a,
it was a wake up call and it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is how you do things the right
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to test everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you test everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You test your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You test other people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use it, if you're going
to breed with it, you want to test it
[SPEAKER_00]: before you don't just get a cut and breed
with it and then sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make sure to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we make 300 out-crosses a year,
basically every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes more, sometimes a little bit
less, but we only release a small portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of those to get tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes they have intersex trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they have some weird stuff going
on, but at least you can tell people,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least you can tell people and you have
honest feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I think that's super
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's plenty of words,
myself included.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you told me, Hey, look, this pack of
seeds, it's got some fire in it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm going to go for that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some guys aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some guys are like, I only buy regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem with only buying regs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as long as there's disclosure on that
seed pack, I think it's fair game,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you're like, Hey, bag seed or
whatever it is, go find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause there's maybe a golden ticket in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's when it's presented as
something that's not, that's where the
[SPEAKER_00]: heartburn kicks in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when you're spending $200.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's crazy what seeds can go for these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo from aficionado, he sells his seeds
for whatever 200 bucks a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he's one of the best breeders I
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a friend and great breeder,
but it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like his seeds go for $2,500 on the
secondary market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once, once like a seed pack is found to be
like a fire pack and then there's no more
[SPEAKER_04]: secondary crosses for a while or going
crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before C junkie switched over some of his
old packs were going crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause people just, the original rainbow
belts, once those sold out and it kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: had its little moment, those packs went
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rainbow belts isn't one that does,
does it for me really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 20, the arc or Fletcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ones I've had, it is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Skittles.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moon bow is way better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried the rainbow belts 20?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's the, that's the one that
Fletcher used to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I've had the 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've had two rainbow belts,
phenos that were crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: One was one that I found, but it was an
awful plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was just, I mean, sometimes I
regret not keeping the plant just because
[SPEAKER_04]: it tasted so incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're talking about, it gave 25% of
the yield of the next lowest plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just kind of like, what am I going
to do with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do with something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, you breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything you got something like that
where it's special, where it's like those
[SPEAKER_00]: trips are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's something, especially if it
doesn't hurt them out, that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: you breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though it doesn't yield a lot,
if it has that amazing expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still turn that into something
down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times people like,
Nope, it doesn't yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like, did you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should have kept it for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at least that's, that's how I
think for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you find anyone who is growing the
rainbow belts 20, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as I would say high, high note,
trebly as a Skittles, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a Skittles to me is just like a
sweet, sweet violin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit loops.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got some like milk and cream in there
and some funk, not as funky as the moonbow
[SPEAKER_04]: we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nice and potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can get your hands on some
rainbow belts 20, that is, that's a very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very good Fino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, it's one of my things in my top
five all time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never get rid of that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to give me some noted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are looking to find out more
about you guys, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have our website.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.beanstockcrf.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's controlled release fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So beanstalk CRF.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go check us out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in the middle of kind of redoing
our socials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Instagram is at beanstalk CRF.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do go follow us there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are planning on posting a lot more
content.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also dropping our own YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start posting on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really just going to modernize a lot
of our, our socials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think another good place is to
also check out Tom's YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be doing a lot of use case
stuff with Beanstalk actually showing you
[SPEAKER_04]: how he uses it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for us, we just think it's so valuable
to show people how it's being used at
[SPEAKER_04]: scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for Tom to be putting in all this work
on the video side, I think that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be, it's going to be a really great
resource for us as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, for us, our Instagram,
mother Magnolia media, you can find us
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been posting there since 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of history for us there in terms
of our cultivars and images of what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The new YouTube channel, Mother Magnolia
Cultivation, you can find us there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our website, mothermagnolia.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're driving through Oregon and
you're looking to find your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: where can they go?
[SPEAKER_07]: So easiest spot, again, shout out Nectar.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were really early to the party with
Nectar.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had, I think four locations when we
first started delivering to them in 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as quick, a short story here that we
had the same breeder who did the Alpha
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue and who did that Sangria Kush had
gotten us a cut that he called Sour Lime,
[SPEAKER_07]: super trepidally dominant cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had the white in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a phenomenal cultivar and he
was getting rid of it and was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, do what you can with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we ran it and it was, you know,
we sent it off for testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely it was, it was exciting during
the first grow of the first table of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on a Saturday at seven o'clock my
phone rings and it's the director of the
[SPEAKER_07]: lab that did the testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, yeah, we got an issue with
that, that sour line that we test.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, fuck what happened?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we fail for something?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, dude, I don't know how to tell
you this, but it came back at 30%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the time 30% was like a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's a fucking joke because testing
has gotten so perverted.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the time they hadn't had,
like maybe they had another 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was super rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an absolute rarity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we had, I had reached out to the
team at Nectar and I'd said, because we
[SPEAKER_07]: had the super strong lime profile,
I mean like Sprite with a couple of slices
[SPEAKER_07]: of lime in it, bright, that loud.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, Hey guys, would you guys be
interested in having exclusivity on this
[SPEAKER_07]: lime that we're cutting?
[SPEAKER_07]: And instead of calling it Sour Lime,
we'll call it Nectar Lime and it'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: exclusive to you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I show up with 30%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lime that like smelled like fresh lime.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like that cemented our,
our position in, you know, center field
[SPEAKER_07]: for them as, as one of the producers that
was going to be stocking their shelves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we haven't dropped a ball since and
we've been one of their, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: their main go-tos for that entire time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Nectar is where, you know,
every, every week we're at Nectar on
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuesdays and Fridays dropping,
you know, product off and they always have
[SPEAKER_07]: a really good line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have good fresh product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such a big challenge.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's, here's one of the filters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's that Nectar, that Nectar imposed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they first imposed this,
it was really daunting and it was really
[SPEAKER_07]: an intimidating filter that they put on
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but once we sort of adapted to it,
it made perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: The, from the test date for indoor flower,
they do not want anything coming into
[SPEAKER_07]: their, their intake at their wholesale
after 30 days for, for, for, from that
[SPEAKER_07]: test date.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at first that just felt really
daunting, but what they were ensuring was
[SPEAKER_07]: that that top shell flower, that indoor
flower was going to actually be fresh and
[SPEAKER_07]: really, really high quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a problem in the California
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of the, because everything's
pre-packed here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the stuff it's pre-packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big problem is, is like,
you might get stuff that's four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get excited about a brand and you get
some good flower one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time you get it, it's four or
five months old.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nectar has done a really good job
establishing that level of freshness on
[SPEAKER_07]: the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, anytime anyone rolls through
through Oregon, just there's 45 locations
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nectar is in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in Eastern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in, obviously their majority of
their dispensaries are in Portland,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're all over the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So any Nectar dispensary that you roll
through in Oregon will have mother
[SPEAKER_07]: magnolia flower and our complete lineup of
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by all means, that's, that's,
that's the place to check it out for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing.
