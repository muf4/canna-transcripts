[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about how we don't dab
very much, and here we are, episode number
[SPEAKER_02]: 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 episodes later, we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our 10th episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon was our first guest, and I wanted
to invite him back to talk about his
[SPEAKER_02]: summer tour and everything that's going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless, bless, bless.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we started filming like six months
ago, our first one, and that wasn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: our first really, you know, we've done
several podcasts over the past couple
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you know, the first one was,
it was nice to see, but it's really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: to see the progress on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching, and yeah, I like what
I see.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've been having a lot of fun with
it, you know, tuning everything in,
[SPEAKER_02]: dialing everything in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got a good team, you know,
working behind the cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing some fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, I hope the people take in heat
to the information that is being passed on
[SPEAKER_01]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very informative, and you know,
I hope that the people really appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what have you been up to?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen you very much lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we're hanging out like once a
week, but... Yeah, well, I've been to
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan, and I've been to Antigua,
Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been traveling a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm promoting my new album,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of been a lot of travels,
a lot of video shooting, a lot of music
[SPEAKER_01]: recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you've been shooting music videos
and all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, this production,
it's my fourth studio album, and this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say, the most extensive production
I've ever been involved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, you know, hard work,
but, you know, I appreciate the fact that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm getting to put the music out
there and still, you know, carry a message
[SPEAKER_01]: to people and be able to perform out
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when's the big release date?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, pre-orders will be June 30th,
and like two weeks after that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the album is going to drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're doing an extensive run because
we're trying to promote this album
[SPEAKER_01]: differently from the ones before,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at the Emerald Cup together at the
awards ceremony.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see Mila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy seeing Mila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice seeing Mila.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that lifetime award was
perfect, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was special, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we actually have some,
Bel from Heritage Hash Company gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the Orange Turbo, and I've been
saving it so we could try it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, man, I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, of course, tried it a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about it, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this is the hash I got from Bel
when I went on to the tour with Mila at
[SPEAKER_02]: Heritage, and this is some of Frenchy's
favorite genetics, the Orange Turbo,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is awesome, and we're going
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've always heard about the Orange
Turbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never had a chance to really taste it,
you know, the flavors in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's going to be nice because,
you know, Turbo, Orange Turbo,
[SPEAKER_01]: that says it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about those rigs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the control, and I like
lower temp, and I like smaller depths,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and especially when you could
regulate, you know, the heat and...
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citrusy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turbo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get a little turbo in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little turbo in there, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little citrusy turbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the citrus in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smell the citrus in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I like that temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: What temperature is that on?
[SPEAKER_02]: 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 365.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like 420, but 365 for 390,
anywhere in there I think is great,
[SPEAKER_02]: but 365 for that low temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a really low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes good, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so what's on the agenda for the rest
of the summer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're heading to Jamaica for album
release party, and then we'll be heading
[SPEAKER_01]: to a few islands in the Caribbean,
Trinidad and Tobago included.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have I have to finish up a few video
shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this album has a lot of videos
visualized well as the audio, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'll be kind of moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a few shows for the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest Reggae Fest is the first one to
come July 22nd, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll be pretty much busy for the
rest of the year trying to get things in
[SPEAKER_01]: order, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also this summer, you know, I sowed those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to put them in the ground
and, you know, have them so I can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing the Marlon Asher's Choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Marlon Asher's Choice in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be on the rec scene coming
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon, very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your favorite crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the favorite, well, I was looking at
the Skittle Banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, you know, something I'm kind of
hoping comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real good because I really like the idea
of, you know, the banana and skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like the.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the banana skittles back to the
skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also anxious to see what the purple ganja
cowboy comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm anxious to see what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so a few of the strains in there
that I'm kind of excited because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be, you know,
one or two good, good mix in there that is
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to come out good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're going to take it from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Launch some pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some packaged flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, you know, eight quarters,
half, you know, it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to bring some different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something different, something unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unique, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I saw some pictures this morning
from Josh Freeman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh Silverback Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing some Piff right now and some
Cuban black haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want the people to appreciate the
strain that I'm giving to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so this is something I'm taking
pride in and I really want it to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go visit Josh, check out his
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, it's been a while since I've seen
him too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was freezing cold that one year when it
was raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely a freezing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some good weather, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been through some weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been through some weather and
storms, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, all in all, the life was
good to us, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, appreciate the cannabis
industry throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Trinidad looking right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I must say Trinidad is looking very
promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just went down there and your name
was being called a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, you know, everyone is looking to
change for genetics for Trinidad because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we kind of showed them that we
have intention of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I went down there and it was
crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, we had some genetics that I,
I took a few packs down there a while ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got a phone call saying,
Hey, remember those seeds you gave me back
[SPEAKER_01]: then?
[SPEAKER_01]: The ganja farmer seed from the ganja
farmer seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I think you gave me some TKO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got it right on my page.
[SPEAKER_01]: TKO and jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I got some smokes for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear I was in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear to God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how the world markets are
changing and getting more geared towards,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean with the same thing,
being in Trinidad, being able to grow the
[SPEAKER_02]: same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that indoor or was that outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, I met a guy who had a little
indoor growing Trinidad and his stuff was
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I plan to give him some ganja farmer
seeds and see how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see the stuff on St. Vincent
to come to fruition too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Bobby in St. Vincent,
he called me the other day and he's saying
[SPEAKER_01]: he can see himself working with no one
else but us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's doing his best to get himself
treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we ever come there, he'll have
everything ready for us, you know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So St. Vincent is, you know, something
that we have on the calendar and we got to
[SPEAKER_01]: pursue and pick up on that soon,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Japan, let's talk more about
Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some legendary stuff right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan was off the train, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away by Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away by the technology in
Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the bullet train to the billboards
that popped out 3D to the crosswalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, Japan is a, it's a big
place too, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many shows did you guys play?
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 shows in a, for how long?
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 days?
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 shows, 13 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of traveling and a lot of
sightseeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that thinks the music industry is
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, it's not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no clue, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw a ad saying, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to be a DJ because everybody
thinks being a DJ is so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kind of the same thing for
being an entertainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone sees the glamour and glitter on
the stage, but man, there's a lot behind
[SPEAKER_01]: that that makes that moment special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, I know traveling takes away from
your, you know, your being, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your way from family, your loved ones and,
but traveling, you know, is so
[SPEAKER_01]: enlightening to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see so much different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see so much different families that I
could love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, for me, being a musician
is, I think is everything that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's worth living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been an interesting journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then music videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been shooting music videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shot some in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like four or five videos,
maybe six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause most of the artists that collab with
me on the album is from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to go meet with them to shoot the
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also to record.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll also, it was a blessed visit to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of, you know, good runnings
with some of the legendary artists that I
[SPEAKER_01]: knew from growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, relations good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica is a nice place to visit always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been there in a while,
but I'm ready to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to take you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch of friends over there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm ready for us to make a trip down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people in the cannabis
industry, you know, look up to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: James, and it's a blessing that wherever I
go, I could hear your name mentioned in
[SPEAKER_01]: positive ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, Jamaica is just one of those
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to make a trip down there soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see what we're going to try next.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some, oh, we got some really good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sour cherries from So Cal Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it live?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's a, it's rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this stuff is just special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as the orange turbo is special,
this stuff is just as special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got this nice cherry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, lately it's been nice to take a
dab since I have my rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were talking about how we
don't dab very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are, episode number 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 episodes later, we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I enjoy, I enjoy this rig a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Milo was in town, Sam from Focus V
came and gave me, gave me a rig and was
[SPEAKER_02]: telling me it's, you know, it's really
good and it works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of skeptical usually of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really like the way it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a solid piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's is very convenient to cause,
you know, sometimes you want to smoke and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't blow clouds in certain places,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried it on the airplane yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we go into Jamaica, we probably try
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these are efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I read some of the
comments online about the battery not
[SPEAKER_02]: being very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: My battery seems to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had problems with it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the lemon flavor in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon and cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, so it's our cherries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's definitely got that cherry kind
of like citrusy, cherry, smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way they get the turps in when
it's live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really hits the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like this is just so smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like taking dabs or hitting
pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a rosin cart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I go to the gym, I take one good
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeps me focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I prefer doing dabs typically
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these aren't even like real dabs,
like not like we used to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're heating up some nail and then some
crazy nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people looking at us funny like
we're doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it's nice where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could dab in my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the extracts are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fits in your cup holder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I smoke and drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I like everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got an army green one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forest green, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a black one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black one's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one that changes all the
colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's, I think they all do that though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's changed color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe all the focus twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it set on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the Carta twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it set away, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate some mushroom and then I was dabbing
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lights was just changing moods.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about all the mushroom
products that are out right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like mushroom a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm all for the mushroom,
the new products that coming out from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are pretty good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've had some nice chocolate
bars that really not too harsh and not too
[SPEAKER_01]: mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just right, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for the mushroom products right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of liking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely taste better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy on everyone to, you know,
get some vibes, have a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now you don't have to worry about
that taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still like eating the mushroom caps,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting those mushrooms stuck in your
teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that I still do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cardboard and sunflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've grown to, you know,
appreciate the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after the taste comes a beautiful,
you know, moment that only a person or
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom can appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like eating the mushroom still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to launch some more
genetics too in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we're trying to get some
blends together and make, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow out some stuff and make sure that we
have the right, you know, we put out
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, but we always put out the best
that we have, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ganja farmer seed is definitely coming
stronger in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can expect to see more stuff on the
James Loud genetics website and also
[SPEAKER_02]: through distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking to maybe some distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds here now has some of the stuff and
we'll be launching some new gear really
[SPEAKER_02]: soon.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you guys can look out for
is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last dab there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a good one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause let me tell you this, it changed the
mood and the high that I was feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is definitely a nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we got some BP times Wilson that
was given to me by Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met one of the events they had BP plus
from Rosentek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: BP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that's blue power.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be any number of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cream too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give the last one a 10 on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the one that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For flavor in like, I still taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year is been your most productive
year ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many tour dates are scheduled and have
you done this year like combined?
[SPEAKER_01]: This year was my most productive year,
even though I had to do less shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do less shows this year to
facilitate the recording and all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff for this new album.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coming up, I got a lot of shows coming
up to finish the year cause the album is
[SPEAKER_01]: finished now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started taking bookings again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that I'm kind of,
I've been missing performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I had my first show a few last
weekend and you know, it was, it was real
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The band was sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was loving the music and the
feeling of being back on the stage again
[SPEAKER_01]: was very, you know, it was overwhelming at
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt so alive, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely going forward, you know,
on tour, we had a conversation with my
[SPEAKER_01]: booking agent and we now looking to put
together an album run, tours for the
[SPEAKER_01]: album.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, definitely it's going to be,
tour dates starts from July 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be back on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back on the road, July 22nd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Till the end of the year.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already been getting bookings for
February.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer is always a nice time for an artist
to be around, you know, cause we got some
[SPEAKER_01]: nice shows out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Caribbean, you know, Canada,
Europe, Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a, it's going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to be back on the road,
you know, traveling, doing music on the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's, it's going to be fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like old times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is burning up the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one is strong.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to be giving that one
a 10 too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much for flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as flavorful, but no,
but it's, it does have good flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of strong too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the strongest one so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far we did it in the right order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is by far the strongest one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what determines the potency in
the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just like with the flowers,
the cannabinoids and the terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage effect between the two of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that high THC does now is give
you the strongest high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these, yeah, definitely these
terpenes and flavonoids affect your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your high significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the terpenes and flavonoids
enhance the high because of the flavor and
[SPEAKER_01]: taste that you constantly get in your
palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We going to do 10 more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I could do 10 more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, we, we kind of pace
ourselves differently over the years when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we would dab back to back like for
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd just sit around and dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high was crazy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then it would be like, I feel like we
had a high tolerance too though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd sit and shoot the shit and drink warm
Heineken's or warm Guinness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot Guinness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Guinness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a tradition that goes back a
long time in the Caribbean, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well in the Caribbean, people think that
you got nothing in your stomach that is
[SPEAKER_01]: cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have no refrigerator down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard, I heard from somebody down there
that it's like a Viagra.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's a liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have nothing cold down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you drink something cold,
you have to heat it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body will have to heat it up before
you can even use what, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you just drank cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you drink it room temperature
now, it goes directly to your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just, it just gives you that boost
of energy and you know, it makes you
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I like drinking it warm because
you know, I sing and cold stuff kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: mess my vocal up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a hot Guinness is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Guinness and tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your secret with tea?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got a secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honey and lemon, probably some peppermint
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tea, you know, is very important to relax
your vocal, you know, cause sometimes we,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a singer, you're not really supposed to
be talking all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having your vocals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you end up talking and smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I am that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to interact with the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, you know, so I always find
myself in the crowd talking with somebody,
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking before a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely helps me to have a hot
cup of tea before I go on the stage.
Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daven just reminds me of we were at the
ketchup fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing with ketchup fire in San
Francisco and we go backstage and these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys have like the old hot knife rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, they were crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They Daven like they just found out about
the evolution of Daven.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 1995 again, you know, like we used
to do hot knife hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through a bunch of my parents
knives, even when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_02]: we would take them and put them on the
burner and get a red hat and put,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, old school hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosin doesn't work like that on those hot
knives.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't heat them up that much,
but man, and then we'd use a cardboard
[SPEAKER_02]: tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you weren't used to doing it,
man, it would take you out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot dabs was definitely crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot knife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I must say, ketchup fire and seeing
them dab in that way brought back a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: memories because, you know, when we were
just starting, we would not know that we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to dab on a hot nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, we started to realize,
oh man, we should make it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ketchup fires from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it was, it was kind of strange to
see it there, but then it brought back the
[SPEAKER_01]: memories of, I wouldn't normally do one of
those dabs, but they were so into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in Rome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing it like, like it's
nothing, but for me, they were dabbing bud
[SPEAKER_00]: like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on the hot knife, pressing the hot
knives together with the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they had a tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I couldn't see myself doing too
much of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that ruins your throat too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the heat was not good for any vocal
after that, but it was nice though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they do it and sing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trippy, but I guess, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Willpower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people want to find out about what
you're doing, where can they go to find
[SPEAKER_02]: more about your tour dates and everything
else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Instagram the best place or website?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, any, so any media platform,
any social media platform, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I always make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a pretty big Facebook following
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you got like a million followers
on Facebook.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I always try to keep my fans and
who's interested in what I'm doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I always try to keep them
informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put up a lot of content on what I'm
doing, when I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone who knows Marlon Asher knows
where to find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Marlon Asher, Instagram, you know,
Facebook, Marlon Sobers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Marlon Ganja Pharma Asher, Facebook,
you know, so everyone knows where to find
[SPEAKER_01]: me on the social media platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, you know, I'll keep,
you know, putting out the info there and
[SPEAKER_01]: hope, hope it reach, you know,
the broader mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when are we going back to St. Vincent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, we should go to St. Vincent soon
because, you know, I'm going to Trinidad
[SPEAKER_01]: with like within the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go down there and do some
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to have some seeds back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do a few experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I want to see how the average
person will grow the seed down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not the guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've given out quite a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always grow the weed down in
Trinidad and smoke it and then say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God, the weed was good, but this is
the first guy that actually saved some for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that was, it's nice to see that
it grew so well, but I would also like to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how the average person, I want to,
I want to give some seeds to just some
[SPEAKER_01]: random people who, oh, I got two trees at
home, you know, just to see how it would
[SPEAKER_01]: grow with them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will definitely give me an idea on
how, on what seed to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what seed to use down in Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny thing with that is they,
a lot of people want the OG Kush down
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, not that there's anything
wrong with OG Kush, but I think breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they have the experience
with OG as yet to... Climatizing that
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic to that environment is kind of
rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It don't really grow down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays short on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure how, you know,
the people down there perceive the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: of OG, but I can tell that they don't
really have the experience and the strain
[SPEAKER_01]: is not really climatized for that weather
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think over the next five years,
they're going to get a lot more stuff down
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the banana is going to do good
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch of banana for, specifically
for St. Vincent, maybe some for Trinidad
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banana crosses that I think will do well
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely more on that tropical
equatorial leaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, we got to, we got to definitely go to
Trinidad right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I've been asked a lot of
question about soil content and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it'll be nice to go visit a few places
and you know, kind of give them an insight
[SPEAKER_01]: on how to really neutralize and keep their
soil alive for planting, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you watch the Scott Scamness from Crest
of Soil episode, he was talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil and microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that stuff is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to know what's in your soil,
especially over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have a lot of fertile soil
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's still a lot of fertile
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have fertile soil because we had a
lot of agriculture in Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I don't know what
they were using to grow as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but the soil is fertile, but I don't
know what the farmers were putting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil while they were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why, you know, it's very
necessary to test the soil down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see how, you know, what is in there
and what needs to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for coming on as a guest
for the 10th episode, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you on the 100th episode as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a snap click and a jump
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must say, you know, it's always a
pleasure to sit with you, James,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, love you as a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll always be, you know, sitting
together and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got really hot, like I'm high as fuck
from that day from that third day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that last one was like, oh,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
No, no, no.
