[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Lab podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, my guest is Autumn from Cultivo,
from so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like the Ryan Seacrest of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too much responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to peel a couple drops
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take it down a couple notches,
but literally, I feel like you are
[SPEAKER_03]: well-versed in so many different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've known each other for quite a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even know how many years at this
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen different places together,
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been to events together,
lots of shows, lots of expos, cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: science, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of mutual friends,
Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to love Ed and Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love Ed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so tell us a little bit history,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll touch on history a little bit and
we'll dive into some fun stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but your history, how you got started with
cannabis, where it all began.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got started in cannabis actually
right down the street from where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: now off of Fruitvale in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my first grow house there about 20
years ago and set it up with eight lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and a tray of train wreck and grew a pound
and a half per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first run, which was really good at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's embarrassing to say now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a pound and a half, you were doing
it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think women sometimes for
whatever reason have this association with
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant and they get better results
sometimes right out the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's kind of like a chef,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our attention to detail and the
ability to multitask a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things at the same time and kind of keep
that mental list of all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely seen some amazing female
cultivators come out recently where it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't use to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I met another female grower
for probably 10 years the whole time I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was the rare women like
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: My aunt, she was growing for medicine back
in the 90s, probably even in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was definitely mostly men.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were one of those boundary pushers
who kind of had to be the first in a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of regards as far as consulting and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the only female consultant that I
knew of back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm an owner's rep, not a
consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to explain the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consultants in the cannabis industry
typically get a bad name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that one of the reasons for
that is because they double dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take money from their clients and
then they'll take money from everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's incentivized all the way up that
they recommend to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we set up our practice was to
be an owner's rep, which is traditional in
[SPEAKER_00]: construction world to kind of back the
client, get them the best possible price
[SPEAKER_00]: and not take any incentive sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it's consulting of sorts because
you are guiding the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was just everybody used
consultant back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's really evolved into something
much bigger.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't even know what a consultant
was when I started consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no position called consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, our mutual friend, Ed Rosenthal,
kind of pulled me up to Canada and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were working on what was the largest grow
in the world at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three hundred thousand square foot
facility in Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first time I've ever met
Ed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I met him once here in
Oakland before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ended up going to Canada and
working on that facility together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of snowballed into what
became Cultivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I started for ten thousand dollars
that I basically maxed out on credit cards
[SPEAKER_00]: and then became what it was was built to
be, which was one of the largest design
[SPEAKER_00]: build firms in the space, certainly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just as far as a reference on
time, that was almost 10 years ago or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe probably about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consulted for a couple of years other
under another company and became their
[SPEAKER_00]: director of construction under their brand
and then started my own about three years
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you work with some of the biggest
brands out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jungle Boys, you know, Mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pretty tight with Mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much you've done with
them, but you're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we I can't take credit for anything
that that he's done, but we definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: have our friend group that we bounce ideas
off of each other and what's working and
[SPEAKER_00]: what isn't working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, you're part of the
Netafem crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the Netafem class.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still still talk to Alistair all the
time, still buy Netafem products all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was the the Fresno crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was me, you, Plum Dog, Mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mango was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really cool class.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got really high pretty much the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took good notes, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have my notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still use a lot of Netafem products that
I would never have used like the four way
[SPEAKER_03]: manifolds that you can stack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned about those in that class and I
still like those manifolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually talked to Alistair the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, can we put together another one
of these classes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to send my whole team down
there and, you know, learn how to use all
[SPEAKER_00]: the MCs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's like, no, now we bring
the class to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you set it up and you buy the
system, we'll come.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come out and we'll set you all up
and we'll train your whole staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better to do it on a working facility
anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, instead of showing you how to
do it in their environment, they could
[SPEAKER_03]: actually do it in your environment and
kind of set you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test all the pressures, make sure it's
working appropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Micah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love talking about Micah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's Micah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Micah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a very dear mutual friend of both of
ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really close.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's like family to both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I started breeding with Micah
and you started growing with Micah to a
[SPEAKER_03]: degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how we know each other,
the same circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did Micah, were you growing before you
met Micah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was growing with a couple of their
friends, several of their friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I met through Micah and we had a
mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't really want to introduce me to
Micah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we randomly met.
[SPEAKER_03]: We met at a restaurant and then we've been
friends ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was 20 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him originally in 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 98 maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known Micah since fourth grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was my older brother's friend and
friends with Ryan Gatika and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other guys that are all kind of close in
our circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he was growing plants when
he was like 16, like out in the hills of
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Barbara or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he always had this wonderful
relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved to San Francisco Bay Area
when I was like 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Micah was kind of one of the only
people I knew here and saw his set up for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time, which was basically him
and his couple of roommates had octagons
[SPEAKER_00]: set up in their basement, you know,
with the tube lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was probably 98 or something like
that because he lived in Oakland in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakland Hills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had octagons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him because he came over and helped
build an octagon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we both like partying back then and
good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he always had like the sour and the
chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
The dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: The OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: DAWG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about it on my last podcast too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to talk after the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everything's got to go through tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like we're putting
everything through tissue culture to clean
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the stuff, if it doesn't have
hoplite and viroid, it has other,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, systemic bacteria and other
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we try to keep every, start clean,
stay clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Justin's motto.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you're a purist and you like a
lot of the same old school gassy stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you, is that a part of your
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of bringing back these kind of older
genetics through tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: re-vigorating them?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that gas will always come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that these things for
connoisseurs, they like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, and the thing is that some of them
may change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we have, you know, the Chem D was the
original like super foul gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then GMO is just like a brighter Chem
D, but it's, they're both amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think these things will change and
people will breed gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think right now, at this moment in
time, people want color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just such a weird thing that like
they put a high demand and high price on
[SPEAKER_03]: color that you've got to have color in
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's gassy stuff with color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even like jokers, the strange
jokers, that has a strong gas and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will always breed with gas and go
back towards those things because those
[SPEAKER_03]: are the things that I enjoy the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're nostalgic because they remind
me of childhood or growing up,
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging out with Micah back in the day or
hanging out with certain friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds like anytime I smell sour
diesel, it reminds me of Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Josh would have these pounds of
sour diesel and they were outdoor and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were so sticky and you'd open the bag and
it would just hit you in the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't, you don't really see
that as often anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the, even with the best stuff,
it's, it's very rare to have stuff where
[SPEAKER_03]: you open it and it's just like this bright
punch to the face with turps, turps and
[SPEAKER_03]: thiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember like back in the day,
you know, you'd have a specific grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: they maybe grew two or three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is my two or three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, purple Urkel and sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had, you know, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that there's anything wrong with blue
dream, but people really perfected the
[SPEAKER_00]: process because they didn't have 10,
11, 12 strains in one room that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to acclimate to the same lighting
and different ones every cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're growing the same thing
over and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the best growers are the ones
that have really perfected that specific
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in the future, there's going to be
directions that come with your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get it from a, you know, either tissue
culture or whatever the facility that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're getting that clone from to grow it
out or seed from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can give people directions like
you're going to need more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need more of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I think these harvest
windows, they're great, like 70 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's also specific to the
environment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lighting too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be nice when we can kind of fine tune
those spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are certain cultivars
that just suffer under LEDs and don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you're able to play with
that spectrum, along with the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really fine tune it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's, I mean, that's the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's, I keep on talking about
data points a lot with people and even on
[SPEAKER_03]: the show, but collecting the more data
points we have, the more we can improve
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, including our pallets, including
the way we do lighting, including
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like data points are just so huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big on data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that, but... Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're big on taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good note taker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a good note taker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, data points specifically,
like now we've got, you know, we're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor this year, so it's... Outdoor's a
little more difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take all the best notes in the
world and the next year could be
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: God's just like, nope, we're going to
start in early rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a, you know,
hurricane in August.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurricane in August, and then we're going
to have humidity of 85% for the next two
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was amazing because we're on our
last bit of stretch before everything
[SPEAKER_00]: flips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've loved this weather so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just drove down from Oregon and we had
like torrential downpour coming into
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for the air quality for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any rain's good for California,
but not necessarily for plants at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those early October rains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you grow really big buds and
you get the issues, botrytis and other
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing more row crop style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more plants closer together,
less volume or mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer that, especially at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know there's guys, Mendo Dope,
these guys growing these, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 pound plants that are 25 feet wide by
20 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's awesome.
It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everyone's got their own style and I'm
not one to knock anyone's style,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do feel that it's partially left
over from the 99 plant count limit days
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, you had to grow the
biggest plant as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get one harvest a year and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could only have six plants and
you're like, I'm going to do the six
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest freaking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest plants I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you try to process it and take
down that mass, again, botrytis,
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then even processing it, like 75% of
that plant is junk, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're still only pulling your top
buds and your outliers and then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: all this mass in the middle that's
basically worthless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take on autoflower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, autoflower, I look forward to
the future of autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's there yet, but I think
it's getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for, you know, it depends what
you're doing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making extract, products,
carts, edibles, like definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely a place in the market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run them next year and see,
see how we like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might give you a call for some advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely have some autoflowers
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think at scale, when you're looking
at doing a hundred acres or 200 acres or
[SPEAKER_03]: 300 acres, autoflowers definitely make
sense because they're very predictable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in the right place,
in the right use, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're getting very, distinct profiles
and we're getting stuff that's so much
[SPEAKER_03]: more consistent where there's less
phenotypical variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, but, but again,
I think there's more work that needs to be
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's getting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if you look at where it is now
compared to 10 years ago, it's a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: different ball game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, you asked me 10 years ago,
I would have said, nah, I'm never touching
[SPEAKER_03]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to breed that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Spain looking at plants that were
this tall, that were yielding like seven
[SPEAKER_03]: grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why would you grow a seven gram plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, unless that's all you can do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grow them 12 inches apart,
totally all the way down and then double
[SPEAKER_00]: stack rows vertical, you got an outdoor
sea of green.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about Chevy volts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love my Chevy volt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best kept secret in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a secret anymore because it
doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause what year was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 2014, 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2013, 14, Micah drives up with a Chevy
volt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, it was a Leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally, it was a Nissan Leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Leaf first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then best kept secret in cannabis
because they were reducing your kilowatt
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought one of these electric cars
for a period of eight hours, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: it took the car to charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they reduced it from, I don't know
what we were paying in kilowatt hour back
[SPEAKER_00]: then, but it, it, it was less than half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you went out and got one of
these cars, the car paid for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically you got a free car and your
power bill was cut in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's how the math worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like I was, everyone, it felt like
we were stealing power, but it was legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was this legal loophole.
[SPEAKER_03]: But literally all our friends within the
period of six months went out and got
[SPEAKER_03]: Chevy volts, Nissan Leafs, all these
electric cars for these rebates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like literally everyone's driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are guys who can afford nice cars,
but we all drove, electric cars and better
[SPEAKER_03]: for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't want a nice car when you
were a grower back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's a recent thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flex was different back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, 10 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, if you had a Toyota truck,
you're like, hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the nineties, we all had Honda
Civics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was the occasional guy that
got the Accord and it's like, dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check your rear view mirrors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, seriously, we're all driving Civics
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to blend in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the most popular car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody got, you know, some of these
guys are making crazy money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're driving money where,
you know, I mean, we didn't really wear
[SPEAKER_03]: watches back then either as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing fancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and it was more about the weed back
then too, I think to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people that were in it were in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, remember when we used to
cure in these jars and like burp the jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd get like a box of these
jars with just the dankest weed you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever smoked in your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently transitioned from jar for my
personal, I went to the turplock bags
[SPEAKER_03]: after doing side-by-side tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like turplock.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they do is they control the humidity
and they off-gas the CO2, whereas like you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't get that with the glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing is, is like the only
disadvantage to the turplock is the,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you put it in your backpack,
you can have squished buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the shape of my buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can always put them in a glass
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have tons of jars if you need to
borrow some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were using the jar method for your
personal up until like a year ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, up until less than a year ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I've still used jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then putting the jars, keeping them in
a cool environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps your buds from getting crushed
for one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks cool because you can look at
your product too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, now we've got the infinity jars
that are UV, they're black.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work really good at keeping all the
turps in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like the infinity jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there's so many options now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the beauty of the legal market is
the options.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's options for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's sensory overload to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I remember feeling like I was set in
my ways and not learning anything for 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I started working in the
legal market, I learned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned something new every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned 10 new things every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do too, but I forget about five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you retain the other five, you're doing
really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you got to take notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you got to have notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you can record it and have it
dictate to the notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: AI is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scary and amazing and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digitize everything now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can record conversations directly to
notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this stuff is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still old fashioned though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still pull out my notepad and
transcribe it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it helps my process to think
it out and have a notepad, even though I
[SPEAKER_00]: can type faster than I write.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I still take notes by hand too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to scan them in with AI and
then it'll put them in nice notes for all
[SPEAKER_03]: your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I still digitize them
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us about what you're doing now
because you're doing all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during COVID, I was working in about
three different states and the airport
[SPEAKER_00]: shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for my job with Cultivo, I was the
main owner's rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of the go-to for most of the
project management and structure of how
[SPEAKER_00]: these buildings rolled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would take on four to eight
buildings at a time and I'd be juggling a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hundred thousand square feet of
building at any given time in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was on a plane pretty much every week
for about eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when COVID hit, I couldn't get on
the plane anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had all of these, I usually would
take all the projects around the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had all these buildings wrapping at
once and then a waiting list of about
[SPEAKER_00]: 600,000 square feet of building to pick
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just couldn't pick up the phone to
take the call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of people reassess their
lives during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building facilities is such an intense
process because you're not just building a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, you're building an entire
business model, at least the way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to know exactly how many plants
you have in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll calculate your clones off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll understand how much cuts you're
comfortable taking off of a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything is built from the
inside out, where typically in
[SPEAKER_00]: architectural design, it's built from the
outside in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you become a part of the staff
augmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You become a part of every part of the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the person that gets called at four
in the morning if any irrigation system
[SPEAKER_00]: goes out in Florida or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a lot, but I loved it and I
really enjoyed my job, my career,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that I built.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just got kind of tired and burnt out
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sitting at home for like two,
three months going, I really need to take
[SPEAKER_00]: another job here, take another client on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a partner that I worked with
previously that was a client kind of said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I think I'm starting a farm
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to come full circle and go back to
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of evolved into looking all
over California, understanding the tax
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and all of the 400 plus
jurisdictions and what they were doing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the local tax level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came across Lake County for the growing
climate, the tax structure, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picked up these properties and we have a
67,000 square foot manufacturing facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is all solventless and allocated to,
it's about seven different buildings that
[SPEAKER_00]: make up that score footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a drying structure that's
just allocated to drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a manufacturing component that
we can run solventless at scale and big
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of brewery equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got automated packaging,
bagging, pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've automated everything in the facility
with the best possible equipment that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind that model is to,
there's so many small farmers in my area
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're, you know, I talked to some
people and they're still trimming last
[SPEAKER_00]: year's product, you know, husband and wife
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like if we buy all of the big
equipment that the corporations have,
[SPEAKER_00]: these small farmers have a chance to
compete at that level if we can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: their cogs down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lake County is a special area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Lake County, I guess four or five
years ago now doing some seed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's a beautiful place and
there's still boutique farmers up there
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the environment's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's not a lot of great
restaurants up there, but there's some.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not a lot of great restaurants,
but there's a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I moved up to Lake County,
packed my bags in LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been talking about this for a while
though, in the whole consulting thing
[SPEAKER_03]: about like getting your own grow and
growing, getting your hands in the dirt
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea behind Cultivo was,
always to get my own facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that Cultivo would be a
catalyst to entering, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal realm with my own facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it happened almost overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember like back when we were putting
our garages together, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you'd spent 20 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Colorado came online with these
bigger buildings and these guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: spending a hundred thousand, 50,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden these buildings
went from a hundred to 200,000 to build
[SPEAKER_00]: out to 20 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, okay, that's a lot of
plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, that was always kind of the
driver behind Cultivo, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really love building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved being able to walk away from it,
give someone else the keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, this is your baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was fun for a lot of years,
but now it's fun going through the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process again, building the staff,
you know, driving the race car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And doing it all for yourself too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And helping other people in the process,
like the, you know, but yeah, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely still growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our throughput, you know, would be
like two weeks in that facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well the licensing process of there isn't
easy necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little challenging for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a program called early activation
where it was designed to help small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers get to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would give them a temporary
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened with that is I
think everyone kind of thought it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: building permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started grading and doing major
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the county shut down that program
and then made everyone go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, which is about and this is,
you know, someone who expedites plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken us two and a half years per
project to get through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much different than LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: LA has got its own challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA will take you three years just to get
your power drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they've all got their different
challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys are planted this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're planted on two acres roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of our what I would call
our R&D farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we'd probably run autos,
run different genetics, cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what we want to put in rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're building kind of another
farm up the street from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be going in probably next
year, 2024.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, do you want to try one of these
pre-rolls?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, but I'm going to get a high spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually some Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's mild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a ceiling, so it doesn't get you
too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: My business partner, he doesn't smoke
weed, but I started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been working on these pre-rolls,
getting the right tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the bamboo crush in here from
Organotips, the right paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like rice paper actually better than
these, but I do like raw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like supporting raw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love them or hate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the company too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like the way rice paper tastes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's not as harsh as hemp
papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been working on the right
temperature to where like I was doing real
[SPEAKER_03]: fatties that were bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these ones actually, you can dry hit
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these all like Knox boxes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, these are all hand rolled and we're
going to have them numbered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Per one of X amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a fun product and it's
going to be a while before we launch
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really enjoy the flavor and it has
if they're too wide, they burn too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're too narrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get as many turps because
you're just not able to draw in as many.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so I feel like it's the perfect
balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the three point five grams is a
nice round eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always come with the big fatty joints
in the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch me get real quiet really quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way they smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the flavor is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have good flour, you can refire
it at any one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put it back in the tube that it
came in, let it sit for a day or even two
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's really good, you can fire it back
up and it still tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably like the best joint roller
I think in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a title for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like every time I read into you,
you have like this perfectly rolled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like how I like to smoke too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I really put a lot of attention to
detail into what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but yeah, there's guys that do better,
professional joint roller and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on the podcast and he does really
good stuff and that's he can roll one
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred and twenty five of them a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really bad at rolling joints
still even 20 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a mental block for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always buddy up to someone like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, you roll a joint as long as they
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could make it happen,
but it's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally looks like a bent toothpick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about five to six months
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's better to try and have
failed than never to have tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we we almost died in a private
jet five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The P.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: incident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're flying out of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was in L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Burbank, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was the the private jet airport
in Van Nuys there next to Burbank Airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wealthy client.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't our private jet, just no,
no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we we were going somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still tell that story when people tell
me they're afraid of airplanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, what I remember about it
was that we flew up to 1500 feet and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we fell out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wearing my seat belt loose because I
remember my my butt completely off of the
[SPEAKER_03]: seat and my cell phone hit the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then flew to the back of the plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my coffee cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your coffee, I think your coffee went
all over you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my coffee cup went up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a couple of three sixties and
landed on my head and landed on your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One on my lap, one on my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coffee in mine, luckily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was because I had to go take
a shower at the airport because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were just taking off from the
airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we just dropped like it was at
that moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like we fell five hundred feet out
of the sky, literally five hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were only fifteen hundred up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not very far.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like a roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but way crazier.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess what had happened in that area
in Burbank, like by the airport over
[SPEAKER_03]: there, you have to coast because there's
all the houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they actually take up to a certain
to a certain elevation and then have to
[SPEAKER_03]: coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the pilot was going up to fifteen
hundred feet, she pushed the autopilot
[SPEAKER_03]: button and we didn't go into autopilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her knee like knocked it out or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember she tried to explain the story
like three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the real story came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our buddy was kind of new planes and
was prodding about what just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that was that was really it was
that moment where you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is what seatbelts are for on
airplanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no, if you fall out of the sky,
you're going to want to be in a seatbelt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can break your neck on the roof of the
plane very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I get into an airplane now,
every time I sit down, I'm buckling the
[SPEAKER_00]: seatbelt, tightening it like that's that's
that's definitely your best friend in this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was freaked out about flying
for maybe six months, a little bit after
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I kept I was working everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was having to fly Europe and I was
having to fly to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: And flying all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had to fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like takeoffs and landings,
I always like the shaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some trauma from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I had some serious trauma for
like a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't get it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like because I I literally had to fly
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two days later, I had to fly
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was flying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I literally would like be holding on
to my seat like, oh, shit, like mentally,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was my second plane incident,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one previous to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a Southwest flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I won't fly Southwest anymore,
but I'm not afraid of flying like I really
[SPEAKER_00]: do love being in an airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like Southwest either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going from L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was with Tracy Ryan from Canna Kids,
you know, and and she's always high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity to travel with anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got her daughter at home that like,
you know, has cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're on this plane and I
just smell burning wires like electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole plane, like, kind of fills
up with smoke and there's electrical wires
[SPEAKER_00]: burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we the pilot comes on and he
goes, we're going to have to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency landing in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, my God, we're on the way
to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, the Las Vegas airport was
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked back to the little stewardess
cart and I grabbed like a bunch of mini
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles of alcohol, like an atrasium like
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to die today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're drinking some whiskey first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so threw a couple of those back,
you know, landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all it was all good and fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I won't fly Southwest to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was on a flight flight last year
and it got hit by lightning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I literally saw the
lightning coming in and the whole sky got
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't travel together anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take separate flights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it got hit by lightning,
I was like, oh, shit, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy like two seats over,
he was like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: These planes are designed to let the
electrical current pass through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's like, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he went on to tell me about the
supercell that he went through when he was
[SPEAKER_03]: landing in LAX one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got hit like 40 or 50 times with
lightning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Designed to go right through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lightning is designed to go right
through the airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you filming?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have another season you're
filming or how's that stuff going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working like 100 hours a week right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm building out our whole facility and
doing all the construction management for
[SPEAKER_00]: it and also kind of managing the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was just no time with all the
development we have going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, you put a lot of production work
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, I'm just laser focused on
getting everything built out up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running, you know, surviving the
California market, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a rough time for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot rougher than we we've both had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know, it's still been tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a lot of navigating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I just I remember now that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we didn't always do really well
at this, and it was a struggle for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time just getting started, getting going,
making cultivation make sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: being the, you know, the buyer,
the distributor, the salesperson,
[SPEAKER_00]: every part for your brand, like when
you're coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't know if I've just gotten
tougher over the years, but it hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it could be a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were really tough back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've always been tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really have to be to be to get to
the point where you're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot of toughness, mental
toughness, attitude, being able to say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think those are all important
and it's good lessons to learn for
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, being able to say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things don't serve you, even when
they sound really good is is a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: my philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just listening to your your gut
instinct and kind of backing yourself on
[SPEAKER_00]: those plays when they don't feel right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you had any advice for your younger
self that was maybe one to two years into
[SPEAKER_03]: this, what advice would you give yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Save the money doesn't last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah, I think when back when we were
growing, even small scale, the the packs
[SPEAKER_00]: were worth exponentially more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So totally running a 12 lighter was like
running a 50 lighter now or whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent is to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe more, maybe 100 lights bigger to
make the same amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No advice to my younger self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think better management of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've really learned that in my
like later later in my career.
Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you have to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when we just had this
recent crash, you know, everybody did
[SPEAKER_00]: these rapid expansions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's why we have a lot of
failure in the industry right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people thought that this model,
this price point was going to last forever
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the market share was infinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people scaled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people scaled.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got money from the government,
not necessarily in Canada, but with
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, even restaurants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a lot of stuff that people thought
it was going to last forever or that they
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't going to have to pay their money
back that they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like you'd have the the best CFOs
in the world making these calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't blame them for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're looking at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The expansion makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll at least make your money back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what everybody thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody thought the same thing
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all went big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I saw some completed projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I saw a bunch of half finished
projects where people realized,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, because the project took so long
that this isn't a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, all over, you know, and I think
I get calls every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Washington went through the second
round of consolidation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I didn't realize there was going to
be a second round.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think a lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a third.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there probably will be a third.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think we saw that consolidation in
Colorado Washington, Oregon, anywhere you
[SPEAKER_00]: had, you know, the ability to get a
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a saturation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except California is over 40 million
people or 39 million people, whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is about four million people in
their program started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing a small country instead of a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a difficult market to track,
even if you've worked in multiple markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting with these international
markets going online to see what's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to happen with places like Germany as they
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, even Colombia is still I
mean, they've been around a while,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're in their infancy to a degree
of the whole legalization and how they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do an import export.
[SPEAKER_03]: Places like Portugal that really are
banking on places like Germany for import.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if Germany doesn't allow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal's got the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal totally has the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be like top of my list to be
worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're talking about countries like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go the way of anything in
ag, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it splits off and you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: These large commodity producers that are
just cranking this stuff out for pennies
[SPEAKER_00]: on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully we have our home
breweries that are farmed to table and
[SPEAKER_00]: have that whole ethos and vibe behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why people buy organic food and why people
are are caring more about their health and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they put in their bodies these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the same thing will happen with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I'm heavily banking on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic diversity is going to come back
into play, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then terroir, we start talking about
outdoor farms in Humboldt and Mendocino
[SPEAKER_03]: and Sonoma and Oregon, where it is like
the microbrewery model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they can do them vertically
integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see a lot of that going on
where you can go to the shop that they
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: from the last episode, he was talking
about he's vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think outdoor farmers, indoor
farmers, but having the small boutique
[SPEAKER_03]: model, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so much more attainable for the
average person that loves weed that wants
[SPEAKER_03]: to be in the industry or younger person
coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that it's much more attainable
than owning this huge mega million dollar
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we don't want to ever get rid of
that boutique model, because that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality lies is in the boutique and in
the passionate people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all boutique product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is product that's really good
grown at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's always the boutique stuff,
which I love boutique farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the most passionate people,
too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should be no different than,
you know, tasting rooms for wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see tasting rooms all over
our county at different farms where people
[SPEAKER_00]: can come up and visit and learn about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, have an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the end of the day, it's all about
experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and what better way to have an
experience than smoke a good joint of
[SPEAKER_03]: someone's stuff or be able to experience
their facility and the stuff they go
[SPEAKER_03]: through harvesting and being able to see
big plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's just something to be said
for big plants also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beauty of what a big plant actually
looks like, like back when we were up in
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma and they'd be, you know,
12 feet tall by 10 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to, but it depends how you
scale what things make sense at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have to do what works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at Cultiva, we built every model
of every type of grow, hydroponic,
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pretty much were able to test out
pretty much all the different systems over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you worked in almost every state,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every state, but in most of the legal
states up until recently, it seemed like
[SPEAKER_00]: you had... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a footprint in most of the legal
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a few we've missed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were doing licensing and you were
doing all kinds of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, by default, in working in some of
the more restrictive states where
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing, you know, sometimes it costs a
million dollars just to throw the paint at
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall and see if it sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have a full set of plans
going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have your board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think New York applications were
like a thousand pages or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they put word count limits after that
because people were pulling up in U-Haul
[SPEAKER_00]: trucks just dropping their applications
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd have to have 10 copies,
like one for each reviewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just like U-Hauls with
stacked binders of SOPs and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually my least favorite part of
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to pick anything in cannabis that
I don't like doing anymore, it'd be the
[SPEAKER_00]: application component.
I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's doing Lord's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having to deal with the people that you
have to deal with, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people that, you know, as far as what
I've seen and experienced a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: actually from you back in the day,
having to re-educate people about their
[SPEAKER_03]: own laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're the government entity that
should understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're actually having to go through
the educational process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you build this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it classified as?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do in this facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so you can't just flip rooms and
take your commercial kitchen and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I like the plan part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the construction management part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like actually physical building the
facility and watching the progress as it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes together.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the planning process is always
the biggest hurdle, I think, at least for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of all the projects you've done,
which one stands out the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, there's so many for so many
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my newest project is always my
favorite until I get the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't look back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's facilities that I would say the
majority of the facilities that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: designed and manage of the construction,
I've not been back inside once they were
[SPEAKER_00]: operational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you never get to see the actual...
Sometimes I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority of the time I'm working
on the next thing and I'm moving on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next thing, like I'm really passionate
about only seeing what's right in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like look back and reminisce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull things that evolve over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking over the years about
different parts that I like of a
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, how you walk into a gowning
room, where you place certain things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just becomes like second nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us a little bit about Israel and
you did some cool things over in Israel
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that'd be great to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started traveling to Israel with my
friend Tracy Ryan that I almost died on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Southwest flight with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her daughter Sophie has what's known as an
optic pathway glioma tumor, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: tumor that wraps itself around the optic
nerve of the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a really high survival rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like a high risk cancer in
that respect, but they also have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: high recurrence rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inoperable tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it wraps itself around the optic
nerve, the child slowly loses their
[SPEAKER_00]: vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Tracy was told that, you know,
by the time her daughter was two,
[SPEAKER_00]: she was going to lose her sight
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: She started her on cannabis at eight
months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was pre Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was before anyone was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no Sanjay Gupta.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just got all these random signs to
give her daughter cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her story, the way she tells it is
much more eloquent and incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gathered all these medical connections
and started doing research all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found or she found this Dr. Deti
Miri, who is a scientist out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Technion, which is Israel's
basically equivalent to MIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working within a hundred million
dollar lab at his disposal, and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all this cannabis research that we
had not done here before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually from her daughter's prior
brain surgery, Tracy was able to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: live sample and basically take it to
Israel and had to declare it and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we met with a doctor that was
going to take the sample, put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they pump human blood into the rats
with the same mutations or same specific
[SPEAKER_00]: type of tumor and then test that tumor
against different cannabinoid profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that may help fight the disease and cause
cell death around this tumor, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first trip to Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met Dr. Deti Miri and I was just
blown away by him still to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the man publishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You introduced me to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper after paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the first time I met him,
I'm like, I will quit my job and come and
[SPEAKER_00]: mop your floors for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I just want to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, he's kind of my
connection over there to the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of pop over there and see what
medical science is doing and how that all
[SPEAKER_03]: works.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stuff they're doing over there,
as opposed to the process that we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: go through for drug discovery here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much red tape involved that it
makes it difficult, almost impossible to
[SPEAKER_03]: do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas over there, most of the studies
and stuff, if you want to do a double
[SPEAKER_03]: blindfolded study is a phone call away and
the government's very supportive of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the opposite up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the polar opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polar opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slowly changing, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Hemp's opening the door for a lot
of that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main reason behind it for people
that don't know is that you cannot bring a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one substance onto a university
property where all of the grand labs are
[SPEAKER_00]: without putting their federal funding as a
school at risk, even if the doctor on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side holds a schedule one research
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been this weird oxymoron that we
cannot study cannabis through our
[SPEAKER_00]: universities unless it came out of the
University of Mississippi, which we kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of all know what happened there as a
federally funded grow that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: growing trash, trash product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the only place that scientists
could legally get cannabis from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've heard since then, there's a few
facilities that have come online that have
[SPEAKER_00]: better product and actually care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that work is just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're at a very nascent stage where
Israel, because it's a small country,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of people, you could do these
micronized studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I know there's more now,
there was only eight licensed grows in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could actually track back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know they did an autism study and
they had these kids who were violently
[SPEAKER_00]: autistic, like to the point where they
would attack their parents and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Daddy Meery put them on schedule
regimen, same strain, same dosage,
[SPEAKER_00]: same everything, consistency, grown out of
the same greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemovar specific.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got a phone call one day that
one of these kids out of a year and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: of studies had attacked one of his
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got another call, the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he immediately went over there and
looked at what the dosage was and then
[SPEAKER_00]: takes it back, tests the product,
goes to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you replace the strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, no, no, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through a series of conversations and
tests, they realized that he actually lost
[SPEAKER_00]: that specific cultivar and replaced it
with something very similar, which caused
[SPEAKER_00]: this complete outbreak of multiple
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about medicine,
that's that's that finite, that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come back to the States and
people are just making wild
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations about dosing on people's
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, you know, it's it's a fairly
safe plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a ton to learn on that level with
chemovars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also the nutrition and environment
that dictates the cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there could be a change in their
environment like they got a new fan and it
[SPEAKER_03]: could produce a different chemovar.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time in Israel, it was all
greenhouse, mostly shade structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But throughout the year, you could if you
have lighting from the sun, you could have
[SPEAKER_03]: a different product, an end product that
had a different profile potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still don't even understand some of
the there's so many cannabinoids that we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't even understand all of them because
they're in such small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the future of medical for the
scientists that really care and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that really care I'm looking forward to
people feeling like they're more dialed in
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a different consumer
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to so many people that are like,
tried that devil's lettuce once and wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost ended up in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought, you know, most of the time it's
anxiety attack from overdosing or taking
[SPEAKER_00]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the more educated the consumer,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we know we can't go buy a bottle of
whiskey and drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could, but you would like the
end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you eat it, you shouldn't
eat 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we didn't measure that stuff back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we know and now we can eat 10
milligrams and see how that response or
[SPEAKER_03]: five milligrams to see how that responds
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you just hope you didn't get the
wrong corner of the brownie and seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong arm of the gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continuity is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people want to know more about you,
your brand, where do they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at Instagram autumn underscore
cultivo c u l t i v o.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have our alchemy 29 Instagram,
which is our manufacturing and processing
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's alchemy dot number 29 on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the same as the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alchemy29.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be open in October for drying
services, pre-roll services.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do full white labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pump out, you know, thousands of
bags and products per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I really appreciate you coming on
the show today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do it again sometime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to be doing some live
shows from farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe at some point we can come check
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come see us in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also got a lot of cool partner
farms in the area and you could do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole little tour through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be really fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
Yeah.
Yeah.
