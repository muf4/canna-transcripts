[SPEAKER_00]: Really with our solventless line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want it to be as clean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yeah, nothing touched it but ice
cubes and water How's it going everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome to the James loud podcast and
today my special guest is Nate from jetty
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today Nate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great James.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to have you here at the facility
We gave you a nice little tour of kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're doing We're kind of really
getting ready for production here in a few
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This place is sick I'm yeah kudos to you
and your team for pulling this off man The
[SPEAKER_00]: build-out is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked to see what you guys do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, so we go back a few years like
four or five years and you guys have been
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it do an extract for quite a while
Ten years our ten-year anniversary is
[SPEAKER_00]: jetty So ten years we've been doing
extracts and we started way back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: two fifteen days and you know,
we started doing Co2 when the reason we
[SPEAKER_00]: started with co2 even though it's not like
the best extract method We just saw a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people getting charged Getting hemmed
up because everybody's open blasting and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know tons of butane Canisters
everywhere dumped on the side of the road
[SPEAKER_00]: and just we thought it was a cleaner safer
method of extraction You know fast forward
[SPEAKER_00]: we learned a lot about terpene terpene
preservation in the extraction process So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know from there, you know evolved to
ethanol and distillate and you know live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin and hydrocarbons And you know now
it's full circle back to rosin and
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless and washing hash like we were,
you know 15 years ago, so pretty amazing I
[SPEAKER_02]: think the industry's come a long way since
using straightening irons to make the
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, that was certainly some
rudimentary tech, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it got us where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So totally It's amazing and then coming
back from bubble hash, you know in the 90s
[SPEAKER_02]: to seeing where bubble hashes turn You
know, it's turned into rosin today and now
[SPEAKER_02]: these rosin carts, you know, you know It's
pretty amazing that you can put rosin in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cart and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean, yeah, like you said back in
the day it was you know before like the
[SPEAKER_00]: really the extract craze really hit and
you know, I had to spend three years in
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego in like 2009-10 and our
concentrate shelf was tiny and the only
[SPEAKER_00]: things we had was You know, it was full
melt three-quarter melt It was all just
[SPEAKER_00]: different bubbles and caviars and sifts
and things like that and just right seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole evolution to where it is today I
mean we couldn't even smoke a dabbing like
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't know how to even smoke oil when
it first came on the scene, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, we're like putting it in joints
Smoking it on coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all kinds of you know, yeah Yeah,
I mean, yeah all sorts of ways and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the swing arms and the bells And all those
funky devices came in the huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were talking this a couple
podcasts ago, but yeah the giant dab rigs
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now we have small Yeah, you know
portable electronic ones that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to you know, use a big torch to light
up Yeah, the whole scene's come a long way
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, the tech has obviously
evolved immensely as well So it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool to to witness and be a part of
yeah, it's wild It's wild and it's even
[SPEAKER_02]: more crazy the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think it's starting to stabilize
a little bit But there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: potential for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is I mean, it's you know this
space in this industry is always full of
[SPEAKER_00]: innovators and people thinking like how to
preserve and More terpenes how to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoid ratio out So,
you know, we're gonna see some cool stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally So let's go from the future to the
past and we'll talk about your Your origin
[SPEAKER_02]: story how you got into the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know teenage years 14 15 probably
started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in upstate New York In Buffalo
and you know, this is you know before we
[SPEAKER_00]: really got like the beast or bc bud kind
of that was a big thing and like later on
[SPEAKER_00]: in my years, but when I first started
smoking it was like Maxi swagweed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know seeds and stems brown gnarly
stuff brown or green Yeah, not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly Yeah, and there was there
was options as far as green but a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't even have names Yeah,
we're gonna call it strawberry because the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of it or you know, whatever Well,
yeah when we first saw like good no seed
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, I would say like that was kind buds
That's what people called it where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah kind butter swag, you know,
there's no other option, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the brown bud was interesting You
you know, I would definitely get you
[SPEAKER_02]: really high give you a headache too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty funky I mean Imagine
having some of that stuff now and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: it through some testing regiment and see
what was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be pretty written pretty gnarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure What's hard to say, you know,
the pesticides were different back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sure I think they were real limited
with pesticides and they probably used a
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy concentration of whatever they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Or they just didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm pretty sure I saw some weed
a few times That was like people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh look at the crystals, but it's just
mold man Heavy mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day before a lot of people
knew what p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was like, oh, yeah, it's extra crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly So when was the first time you saw
hash hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, I saw it growing up
like upstate New York It was really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to get but the first time I went to
Amsterdam was when I saw Like good hash
[SPEAKER_00]: and variety of it and that was probably
like late 90s 2000 right around there Wow
[SPEAKER_00]: nice did a trip out there and like You
know, the the bud was impressive but the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash at that time I think was like really
what blew me away I was never a big fan of
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam weed except for the California
stuff for American stuff over there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like that definitely the hash was on a
whole nother level Yeah, I think you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: brought a lot of game to Amsterdam all you
guys that went over there back in the day
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure genetics wise and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the good genetics really
originated here and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had their they had their run with the
seeds and with the genetics and You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to a degree they they started
doing stuff at scale long before they did
[SPEAKER_02]: in the states as far as You know seed
companies, especially yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah pushing the envelope with stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I no doubt they've had,
you know a lot of influence on where we
[SPEAKER_00]: are today, but yeah, I think that's kind
of no offense to anybody out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, but Yeah, I think we've always
had him beat on flower for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and quality quality flower I feel
like we've really had like that and just I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like you know in certain places of
the world There's things where you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that they originate like I feel like
California is the epicenter for quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for new genetics I feel like a
lot of it's you know, and not that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not coming from other places too But I
feel like the starting point a lot of it
[SPEAKER_02]: has come from Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the building blocks of it all man for
sure for sure Absolutely, and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of passionate people, you know I give
a lot of credit to the Grateful Dead In
[SPEAKER_02]: here and kind of the you know I feel like
there's some connection to the Grateful
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead with everybody that's been around
here long enough Yeah, I mean I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about that with my friend the
other night and exactly like that That was
[SPEAKER_00]: a foundation and really like touring and
all that stuff really spread a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties all around the country Which is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely and even bubble house in
the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know totally totally I really
like that 90s bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was even before bubble bags I
think people were using like we did silk
[SPEAKER_02]: screens and we were we were drying them on
the screen before we'd scrape it off the
[SPEAKER_02]: screen right hand stir for 15 minutes one
direction and then they had a recipe that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd follow It was amazing like when I
you know, cuz I was like Fast forward a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years from like when I first
started smoking but I was living in Utah
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were selling cannabis and you know
a lot of the Cali guys would bring packs
[SPEAKER_00]: over to Utah and Right, you know,
it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we had a very limited market
We had really good weed and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get rid of the bubble hash So it
always be like sell these couple peas for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a quarter pound of bubble
hash and to me I was like, I like totally
[SPEAKER_00]: want the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, it was interesting like just how
people used to do it back in the day Just
[SPEAKER_00]: from trim and just get rid of it and it
wasn't as valued as high for sure There
[SPEAKER_02]: was a point where trim was free like you
would get trim for free and a lot of us
[SPEAKER_02]: did We'd trim wet and so trimming Wet you
get a you know, you get a lot you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of sugar leaf, too You know some of
the stuff we just mix it all in together
[SPEAKER_02]: But like we that's how we get great fresh
frozen because we trim wet and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: just throw it right in the freezer We make
bubble hash from that that stuff was
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember getting some amazing cues of
bubble hash You know where you have like
[SPEAKER_02]: the orange colored bubble hash that was
just from purple weed or whatever Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the really nice blondes to like the sour
always made that really nice blonde bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah and long before we had freezers
the Harvard Rights to get blonde hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were getting some good blonde
bubble, you know Keith and get bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm Yeah, yeah I mean love those days
and just kind of the old stories and
[SPEAKER_00]: people taking Maytag washing machines and
hooking them up and trying to get pricking
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it automated and not hand paddle
and five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I started with five gallon Home
Depot buckets, you know, totally Same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing with the bubble bags too with the
five gallon bucket with the bubble bag
[SPEAKER_02]: sets and I never I didn't like using all
Seven bags or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's it was a lot of work to
pull all those bags for you know Not that
[SPEAKER_00]: much reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah Yeah, I mean there was a point
where we had a bunch of bags on we had a
[SPEAKER_02]: big tree in my backyard and we had Five
bags set up at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where we are or five five buckets I
put where you're pulling you could
[SPEAKER_02]: actually tie it off So it drip because
they're lifting a heavy bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like just wears on your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm too old for that shit now Yeah,
it's a lot of work, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we always say it's yeah,
it's a young man's job even like With the
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy automated washers we have now these
days It's still you know, there's big bags
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of water in those bags and just
sifting through it's just yeah So you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are still manually doing some of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of yeah Like kind of
the sifting of the bags and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that getting the water to drain all that
stuff done manually So, you know when you
[SPEAKER_00]: got, you know Five gallons of water in a
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's heavy and you know, just
cleaning out the machines, you know We're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing you know, 15 pound runs and things
like that 15 pounds of wet soap cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Well 35 pounds doesn't seem like that much
weight but try shaking 35 pounds up and
[SPEAKER_02]: down for a while and then like Doing it
again and five minutes later ten minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: later and I'm the same man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an old old guy It's hard work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the young guys in there just
yeah, they're stoked to do it and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: all They're all feeling good, too Yeah,
and to a degree some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's still considered
innovative I feel like we're still you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I mean especially with the automated
systems that they're doing today where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can do it at scale because That's a long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a that's a lot further from
the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, I mean that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said like it's still pretty
labor-intensive it's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as like our solvent list
departments our biggest team or You know
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal throughput compared to hydrocarbon
or ethanol extraction or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that So, you know the manpower it takes to
produce, you know a kilo of live rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a kilo of you know live resin is
Drastically different so you guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: still doing live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah we do You know, it's not a huge
category for us But you know we do it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the one good thing about it is
like the strain variety You can basically
[SPEAKER_00]: put any fresh frozen, you know in a butane
extractor and you're gonna get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: product out as long as it's good coming in
where the solvent list genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the rosin genetics are a little
bit harder to Find the ones that hit
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics play a huge role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know in yield especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yield is you know It's hard because
the consumer want you know They don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay a hundred dollars a gram for
certain things and you can't charge them
[SPEAKER_00]: more necessarily for stuff that doesn't
Yeah, they don't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few brands that I pulled that
off but it's a it's a tough thing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ultimately, you're just seeing you
know when you look at the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Unfortunate but you know the more
price conscious brands and value brands
[SPEAKER_00]: and value products are what's kind of
pulling off the shelves these days
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in with the recession and all
that stuff, you know, yeah people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have as much money anymore and Some are
willing to sacrifice quality for quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd say the majority of the
consumers are like that, unfortunately So
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we're just really trying to you know
a big focus for us with the solvent list
[SPEAKER_00]: play is getting you know stuff that hits
at least 4% to wash and if we can do that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can keep our price point like Somewhat
competitive with everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your opinion on live resin
versus live rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen COAs comparing the two where you
actually get more more terpenes Obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: water-soluble terpenes get lost in the mix
when you're washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's your opinion on the whole
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, I mean You know, I'm not like
religiously, you know one way or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a good product at the end of the
day I want something that tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Certain profiles and certain
strains that I think come out great with
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbon We just won Emerald Cup for
first place for our super lemon haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is classic strain Well, that would
never come out in the wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would never be able to like taste That
strain that way if we didn't run it
[SPEAKER_00]: through hydrocarbons So right so,
you know just having the optionality to do
[SPEAKER_00]: both I think is good and just kind of
doing the plant justice and you know again
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like as long as you're doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purged, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe at the end of the day,
you know I really have no problem with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's my opinion It's all about do
you put a blindfold on and like what
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes good and yeah, you know,
it's clean You know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something just I think even
The analytics like what we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're only testing for 40
something terpenes these days They're not
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for flavonoids esters any other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know aromatic compound Yeah,
so so I think there's like, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is like a complexity to like
rosin that like you can't really put your
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the data you can't really see it
in the data, but you know, it's there
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like something really flavorful
when you rosin hits hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it hits hard You know, you just have
more compounds a fuller spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, which is mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think You know does something to your
cb1 cb2 receptors, whatever up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, you know that yeah that you know
hits you in a different way We're not even
[SPEAKER_02]: sure of yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so much new science that's
yet to be discovered So, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we got a bunch of receptors and
we're still figuring out how they all work
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty awesome Yeah, and what terpene
and then the terpene matrix with this
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene and how those things affect it
synergistically it's so yeah a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: really amazing cool stuff that we're just
learning and still discovering new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids like dude with the You know
now with these hemp conversions and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just feel like there's a new
cannabinoid I see out at and they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: gas stations and wherever the Midwest,
but I have a feeling the farm bill next
[SPEAKER_02]: month Which might come out around the time
this episode airs is gonna change some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean I think Because i'm seeing
that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we're you know, there's all
these different versions of thc And it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're all they're they're not
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're you know, yeah conversions
some of our you know synthetically derived
[SPEAKER_00]: and all sorts of crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think we got to be like a
little careful on you know What we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and how we're putting things out and
try to keep it what we're true to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mama nature if I can, you know put out in
the plant in the first place in those
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's anything wrong
personally my opinion on the conversions
[SPEAKER_02]: like Delta-8 I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using good starting material and
you're using the process correctly It's if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just taking pure shit and you're
you're basically converting that And
[SPEAKER_02]: calling it Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you're gonna get a good end
product necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, and there's some powders and
catalysts, you know that are used in some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those conversions and just making sure
it's clean and you know, you know A safe
[SPEAKER_02]: product for the consumer at the end of the
day Yeah, I mean i'm a big fan of pure
[SPEAKER_02]: taca, you know to ingest pure t it doesn't
get you high It doesn't give me high but
[SPEAKER_02]: it you know, you get the medicinal
benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the medicinal benefit of it Yeah,
i've ulcerative colitis and it's just it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Nice Yeah, and Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Delta-8 for sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's a fifth the strength of You
know Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got a yeah, I kind of intro,
you know, because CBD it's just like it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't you don't really feel anything,
you know, but so some of my family members
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like kind of new to the scene I'm
like kind of give them a little Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like just kind of in between,
you know, like kind of the starter stoner
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what I really like is cbg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I really like cbg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like smoking cbg even I haven't found
really good tasting cbg yet But I really
[SPEAKER_02]: like the relaxing effect of cbg where cbd
kind of like just makes me tired I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get a lot out of just smoking good cbd
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although cbd good I've tasted some really
good cbd flour and joints cbg I've yet to
[SPEAKER_02]: taste any so if anybody out there's
watching and they have some good cbg
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics that tastes amazing I'd love to
hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree That's you know,
one of the cool things That you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and just you know, bringing these
kind of alternative kaminoids breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: them up Having good terpene profiles
because like you said, you know cbd
[SPEAKER_00]: generally was hemp and it sucked and now
there's cbd varieties out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like sour diesel and look beautiful
and thank you like holy shit and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a market for the genetics I think
the cbd, you know I think there's a market
[SPEAKER_02]: for everything for the flour for the
genetics for all of that like good
[SPEAKER_02]: high-end cbd flour that's smokeable and
there's like Huge market of people that if
[SPEAKER_02]: it tastes great and they had access to it
and they knew about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I mean You know Tobacco is one
thing but yeah, if you can smoke more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal herb and yeah You don't get high
or a little relaxed just like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a square freaking Newport whatever
but it's way healthier for you like why
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't you you know, so I think there's
a You know, we can talk conspiracy and big
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco and all that stuff later But sure,
you know, I'm sure they're a little scared
[SPEAKER_00]: or also trying to get in the game,
you know natural menthol cbg I mean those
[SPEAKER_02]: are things that can be bred in for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen menthol come out a lot in
cannabis You know, we used to call most of
[SPEAKER_02]: this the menthol stuff because I feel like
menthol isn't necessarily Desirable
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it can throw off all kinds of
other stuff interesting interesting So is
[SPEAKER_00]: that just a terpene?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I I think it's more in line
with a thyle Okay, then a terpene but it
[SPEAKER_02]: could be terpene specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not sure we need to identify
COAs because we just usually you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not Like I'm looking at the COA and
pulling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just pulling them because I'm like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it Yeah more just more
analytics more standards because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know for you know What are we
testing 20 cannabinoids and 44 terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's just the tip of the iceberg
Well, and not all terpenes are created
[SPEAKER_02]: equal so you can have one that's in high
concentration that basically That is that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't taste very much of whereas
something in a small concentration is
[SPEAKER_02]: super Super potent and pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we're seeing That like,
you know in a lot of the extracts we do
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know the more we can preserve the
monos through our process Like yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're minor but they make a big
difference in how everything tastes versus
[SPEAKER_00]: like we can tell if We added a little bit
more heat to the press or this that the
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing, you know It's just like night
and day as far as flavor goes you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the jar tech a little bit
basically taking I mean The simple
[SPEAKER_00]: rudimentary way is just taking live rosin
you want to deep basically to put anything
[SPEAKER_00]: in a vape you need it decarboxylated So
getting the oil to the right consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: the more THCA you leave in your product in
a vape, you know more poorly it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: function so we want to You know
decarboxylate that oil With while
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving the terpenes like that's kind
of the art in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know with jar tech Take the rosin
put it in the jar heat it up slowly some
[SPEAKER_00]: people eat it up fast You know,
you have your own kind of recipe as a chef
[SPEAKER_00]: you would know, you know, just sure
Certain things certain heats and pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally, you know, so, you know kind
of figure that out, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing Yeah, that's what I mean the you
know, it's like the building blocks are
[SPEAKER_00]: still there from like the old-school
methods We're doing especially on the wash
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that But you know just
little you know, and these are things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty common I think as far as you
know, you talk to you know people that
[SPEAKER_00]: work and you know the chemistry industry
of science and you know work in different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of extraction methods like oh,
yeah, that's super simple and makes total
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, but it's still Relatively new to
cannabis as we kind of bring bring new
[SPEAKER_00]: processes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean holy water I don't know if
you remember holy water back in 2013 we we
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was with loud seeds or we had loud
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought that to Denver We had two
booths and we entered holy water with the
[SPEAKER_02]: holy water guys big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep Yeah, yeah, they they did not know how
to judge it and they apologized because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was amazing and They had given me a bunch
of samples and I was literally I had a rig
[SPEAKER_02]: with an email and was literally pouring
Yeah, it's everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know and that was like some of
that stuff was like 30% 30% Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that stuff Yeah, that was freaking
amazing what they they came up with back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day and definitely You know set the
trend to the HD and all that good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I wouldn't when it first came
out as game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was a game changer now There's
definitely other things that are amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's it's funny all these stages
We've gone through to get to where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: at now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's what's exciting about You
know keeps us I think all charged up for
[SPEAKER_00]: the futures new genetics new strains new
profiles new tech I think we figured out a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the tech now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay Let's get the genetics
dialed in and then they may come out with
[SPEAKER_00]: new tech in the future That's kind of
really what we you know, we could talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that internally like what's the new
tech?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a new thing coming out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like what we're all excited
about is like what are the new profiles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like we were talking
earlier I just you know, what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know can finish a little quicker as a
different profile because we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking sick of GMO and You know all kind
of the normal hash strains totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think the new flavors are
for hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: The big washers gonna be I mean,
I think I seen the Banana conda banana
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreos some of some of those banana lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the banana lines are definitely,
you know that one like definitely fan
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite We've been running different,
you know banana creams banana punches and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff for the last couple years and yeah
You know, those are the ones that always
[SPEAKER_00]: win the awards, you know, like they just
have a you know You look at the analytics
[SPEAKER_00]: to just a different terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, I'm seeing some more
Oranges, I haven't seen like citrus really
[SPEAKER_00]: come into play So I'm curious if we can
get like I said like super lemon haze not
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know, just different citruses
Yeah, it's a tough one doesn't really wash
[SPEAKER_02]: that well, but but is it possible to breed
it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or is it the specific?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes they give the resin the structure
that it has you know where you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the trichome heads and that's a big
part of it It's hard to say we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: really kind of also geeking out on
trichome morphology and just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: different trichome structures and What
makes a washer a washer and you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbous head and you know How thick is the
cuticle and will the cuticle just get
[SPEAKER_00]: crushed by the ocean water and all the
resin just washes through the bag Versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know just one that has like the right
head the right neck stem all that
[SPEAKER_02]: structure So what is that if you don't
mind sharing or is that I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't have like we're you're
still working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're we're we're definitely
studying it we unfortunately, the market
[SPEAKER_00]: is Slow and that costs a lot of money to
do like a really good research program and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow out a bunch of strains and really get
Good trichome morphology data,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have hunches of what's making
washers and we're you know, keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind With you know our farm partners
and things like that So so I get a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: chapter in the book that's coming out
later this year on breeding cannabis nice
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah, there's a whole chapter on on
I'm trying to get as much data as I can
[SPEAKER_02]: we're in the final stages of the book,
but I feel like it's such an important
[SPEAKER_02]: thing and It's kind of like the future of
breeding is all not not all of it But
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a good chunk of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like how do we breed for
extraction?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know depending on the
method I think you know, cuz like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: with hydrocarbon you can Pretty much put
anything good in and you're gonna get a
[SPEAKER_00]: good product out Right with you know ice
water has certain sifts certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know You can talk about crazy
extraction methods using sound and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, but electrostatic
electrostatic is a new one that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think a lot of people even know about but
let's just it's almost like old-school new
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we We did an entry for that in the
Emerald Cup It's very hard to scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: but a really cool process to see and do
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so there's the way with the glove
where they brush off the glove Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it seems like it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it is but you know, like I said like
at some point somebody's gonna you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the hair straighteners at the
beginning like somebody might figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to Scale it with some crazy,
you know frickin scientific magnet frickin
[SPEAKER_00]: thing or something And all the heads just
come out and stick to it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how cool would that be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where you can turn the magnet on and
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally So yeah, I mean,
you know, those are a lot of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been tracking You know nitrogen is
interesting some people have messed around
[SPEAKER_00]: with that haven't really cracked the code
But that's one I've you know when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of first pitched on some nitrogen
tack It was like we're gonna bring a big
[SPEAKER_00]: giant air gas truck full liquid nitrogen
out to the farm and we're basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna frickin blast everything with liquid
nitrogen and we're gonna harvest all the
[SPEAKER_00]: heads take all the heads and you just
Leave the farm with instead of with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass That we end up tossing at the
end of the day all the post-ran stuff all
[SPEAKER_00]: that waste material stead stems and leaves
and etc All we leave the farm with was
[SPEAKER_00]: just heads and trichomes, you know,
so so there's some interesting methods out
[SPEAKER_00]: there I think that we'll figure out which
one's real and which I think that makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of sense though I think whether it's
using that that method of extraction But
[SPEAKER_02]: but field extraction where you're
extracting on the field to a degree where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not having to leave and put this
stuff in a huge warehouse Super
[SPEAKER_00]: inefficient, you know, we got freezer
trucks and freezer containers all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: goddamn state It's like it's yeah if we
could just have the trichomes because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going for as extractors
you know, that would certainly be a Be the
[SPEAKER_02]: way most people don't realize how
expensive it would be to refrigerate a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred thousand square foot warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, just the cost it's it's not
cheap and yeah talk about when you're you
[SPEAKER_00]: know The power goes out and you know a
freezer goes down or truck breaks down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the side of the road and all your material
turns to frickin mush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's It's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Redundancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, life's about redundancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Those in place, but you learn
from your mistakes too, and it only takes
[SPEAKER_02]: a few of those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely I feel like we made
everyone in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll keep making I'm sure but Me
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like but I feel like I've learned
from a lot of mistakes That's that's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of my growing process have to man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't be here if we didn't you know,
yeah for sure Yeah, especially as you
[SPEAKER_02]: start getting into scale It's better to
make your mistakes early on than to make
[SPEAKER_02]: your mistakes small mistakes are much
easier To recover from the big mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's yeah, there's certainly a
lot more consequence now than ever before
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah, we've learned so, you know,
we've made that mistake too and yeah learn
[SPEAKER_00]: to start like small batch pilot and just
make sure everything's right before we go
[SPEAKER_00]: into big production runs totally Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah seed reversals doing reversals making
sure you have redundancies for those those
[SPEAKER_02]: are always important seeds is like having
some sort of redundancy if you're making
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds because What if that
reversal doesn't happen and you've got all
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: That are in veg that need pollen when
they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true Yeah, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a lot of things that can go wrong if
you're not planning for it You're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: end up getting nip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of products you got here
today to share with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I you know, I brought you a couple vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is The jetty solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Amorello This one's in a different
package because it's okal certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know okal,
but Basically, we can't say anything's
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA organic in right cannabis So the
state love them or hate them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they came up with a program That
mimics comparable to the USDA organic
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a little more strict There's
a couple pesticides on there that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: even on the USDA Organic list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and You know our farm partner cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of starts with them our farm
partner coastal Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they've been working on
Regenerative soil and organic practices
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a blueberry farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is organic USDA organic certified on
their farm so they're in the practice of
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of doing that and all that upkeep
that and just kind of you know using all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of natural pest mitigations and all
that good stuff, so they're in the habit
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing that so they got certified and In
that program manufacturers can get
[SPEAKER_00]: certified, you know, if you're using
solvent stuff Well, you can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: certified but a non solvent process you
can so We got the okal certification So
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're slowly switching all the lines
to like basically us comparable to USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: organic So that's why this one's in the
white package to kind of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiating it We're just going to
market with it But you know, it's as
[SPEAKER_00]: organic as it can be, you know beyond
organic really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's regenerative It's it's it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know really with our
solventless line We just want it to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yeah nothing touching it,
but ice cubes and water in the process and
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just a really awesome
Process and a really good program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just generally what I eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to eat organic I try to you know,
same stay on the healthier side of life
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gnarly the shit They put in
food dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seriously and I mean if you're eating
bananas might be okay, but other stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like lettuce Yeah,
any sort of greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should be eating organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally berries berries another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one If you're eating
berries, you probably think like the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: industry or grape industries like the
biggest consumer of micro butanol like on
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet like Spray needle 20 all over
everything, you know, and then we're
[SPEAKER_02]: eating it, you know, so Hamel on the other
hand, they're in Sonoma and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: biodynamic and they do not use any of the
bad stuff And I really like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I drink a little wine now and
then but Hamel is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a bunch of amazing there
So yeah, there's some some heady folks out
[SPEAKER_00]: there doing it the right way, but you know
the big box People are just yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: just crushing for pesticides everywhere
monocropping, you know It's another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys do is they're you know rotating
crops and things like that So it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not you know monocropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of our packaged food if you're
looking at you know packaged food stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that's pre-made most of it is made from I
Wouldn't say great quality ingredients
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so yeah I mean that's kind of like,
you know our way and just you know I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we just all want to live like a good
healthy life I believe food is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe cannabis is medicine And whether
you believe it is or not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah want to make it as clean as possible
And you know the old cow certification
[SPEAKER_00]: just adds a little you know, we can
differentiate product that way There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other rosins out there,
you know, we're it's a little more costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to pay the certification fees It's
a lot more of the logging and cleaning and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that in between the processes
But you know where we just want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: that to the consumer like at the end of
the day Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan of all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these give me really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is another Jetty's solventless
cart and then here we could doing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasting flight, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing like these little half
grammars kind of like a flight of beer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so you get to taste all the You
know some of our favorite flavors things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some really nice cold cure good
stuff a lot of fun and I feel like a Half
[SPEAKER_02]: gram goes a long ways for a lot of people
like me I do cold start when I do Dabs,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah cold start I use small amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like tasting turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like flavor Yeah, so at the end of the
day, I mean I like the effect dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong The effect is
important, but I also like flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: especially I might take five or six.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was it's great to have different
flavors Variety is the spice of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're just trying to offer that
and that was um you know, so I was like it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems simple but like metric and
Compliance and all the bullshit to put
[SPEAKER_00]: four different skews in one package,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a nightmare, but It becomes a big
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but yeah at the end of the day It's
just we kind of wanted to offer something
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's two grams total half grams They're
in these cool little like pop vac jars,
[SPEAKER_00]: which actually like vacuum seal themselves
So really good for terpene preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and is there a lot of diversity between
each product or you similar ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean there's you know, we have all
the profiles underneath but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's like an orange There's a
papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you know, something that's a
little on the sweeter side a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: on the gassy side So we tried to be you
know as diverse as possible But that said
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where like I'm hoping your breeders
come up with even more diversity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so what are the most popular
flavors right now that you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing, you know It's like what are
we like and what are we smoking on and
[SPEAKER_00]: like what is like the general consumer and
the data kind of tell you it's Vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like what the heady crew and like
really heavy users are you know on and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I think the traditional market always
moves A little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's new strains out that You know,
I'm getting but we can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialize them or get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean not in the solventless side,
but you know fat So is one that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sells really good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean GMO as much as we all like see it
everywhere It is similar like they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of similar profiles We did a cereal
milk recently that's sold like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that one washed though?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the greatest but we got It to hit
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there I think there's certain
phenos of it that will I got a cereals
[SPEAKER_02]: cross that I think would work really well,
but the same thing It doesn't yield crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah flavor profiles and that's kind of
it, you know, we'll like make exceptions
[SPEAKER_00]: if it hits a different bucket on the
terpene profile, you know, so You know as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as kind of our average yield when
we're watching like a bunch of strains in
[SPEAKER_00]: a month kind of hit those numbers where
we're okay, but Yeah, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on like What the flavor of the
month is but yeah, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know You're talking about
cereals and you know, the new banana
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses and things like that are like
things that we can't Get commercially yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumers used to kind of what
we're feel like smoking a year or two
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago Sometimes right LCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally totally, you know the data
and you know when you look at like BDSA
[SPEAKER_00]: and like these big kind of like,
you know Data aggregate companies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like blue dreams still hold strong in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's freaking crazy I made blue dream
crosses last year that I'm about to
[SPEAKER_02]: release nice on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think People like blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah people like blue dream and whether I
like it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean as far as like I Think it holds its
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's something I can enjoy every
once in a while I think that the Terps are
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect is just very subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the effect of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cuz it's more more mild Yeah,
it's lightweight for sure tastes good like
[SPEAKER_02]: the extract tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm Yeah, and it was like always a fan
favorite for like Cultivators back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, but I think we all just blew it up
and grew so much of it 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like totally so beat and I just
yeah, it blows me away that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still trending and like, you know
when you look at just kind of the it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different consumer, you know, we're like
probably your viewers and like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people we talked to are just like so
inside it and like what's the new strain
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's the new flavor, but you know,
you kind of look at what Selling
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently and pulling off, you know
retailer shelves Dispensary shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like yeah, it's blue dream and no
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally It's crazy, you know sour
diesel and you know, like kind of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder how that's gonna go over in
metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've changed the name on that one a
couple even when I had dispensary freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 15 years ago You know, it's like being
bubble and this and that people just were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of offended by the name But man that
one like was another crazy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finished in six and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was frickin loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Yeah, so I had a green crack that
you I could grow it side by side with blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream and it grew almost identical like as
far as like it was a Ten plus weaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so 70 to 77 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and But the green crack was super
strong You would smoke it and but you
[SPEAKER_02]: would build a tolerance to it almost
immediately But like if you're smoking it
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time you give it to your friends
You're knocking your friends out and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like it was like a really short high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was it too Yeah, my buddy had a
fino of it in Lake County crushed it with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful And yeah, it was six and
a half weeks finished so quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was like pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, it was it was a crusher for
many many years You did great with that
[SPEAKER_02]: one Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think bringing back old flavors is
another thing that's gonna happen Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know because I think we still have
access to either seeds or people have
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved the genetics give the cuts Yeah,
yeah, there is you know, we recently Got
[SPEAKER_00]: the brand into the East Coast into New
York and you know, it's a slow roll out
[SPEAKER_00]: there but like The OGs that have been
there for a while and like, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem and like the kind of old East Coast
strains People still are hoarding those
[SPEAKER_00]: and have those beans have those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been sitting on so yeah,
it's exciting You know, it's like man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel like sour got lost out here
for a while But like there's in high
[SPEAKER_00]: demand right couple guys like with these
little closets, you know little small
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouses that are like, oh Just still
have like that, you know, great East Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: our man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool before we rolled the
cameras We were talking a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: hop latent and I feel like sour was kind
of the vector to a degree of hop latent or
[SPEAKER_02]: one of them and Sour diesel was amazing
and most people having been able to like
[SPEAKER_02]: lately have not been able to experience
the sour diesel like we used to get and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think a lot of it is due to hop latent and
there's viruses and also just age Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know some of these genetics are sold
if you think a lot of stuff was early 90s
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's not like It was today like the
91 is still pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it man And that's what's cool
about what you guys are doing here I think
[SPEAKER_00]: with that TC stuff and you know being able
to bring it back and revitalize those
[SPEAKER_02]: old-school genetics gonna be super cool
Well and being able to use for us using
[SPEAKER_02]: them for breeding, you know, we have the
nursery model too but I think really using
[SPEAKER_02]: them for breeding creating new stuff and I
think We'll be able to pivot in any
[SPEAKER_02]: direction the market goes because it's not
always about what I like because I like
[SPEAKER_02]: You know as a chef to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't always cook the food That I love
but I love cooking for people and I love
[SPEAKER_02]: making genetics for people and also I want
to bring the market what the market wants
[SPEAKER_02]: and everybody has different needs and
wants and you know, I think it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting kind of the way The
market is shaped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in this place where people wants new
stuff every two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not gonna be like that
forever I think there'll be always a
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in that stuff, but I think a lot
of the stuff will stabilize We'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's really amazing and then
companies will settle on that Is their own
[SPEAKER_02]: proprietary thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so and I'm looking forward to that
I'm also, you know in the sense where a
[SPEAKER_02]: company can do that But also where a home
grower can grow his own just like how a
[SPEAKER_02]: microbrewer can grow or brew beer Sure
home grower can grow his own and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the future is wide open to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah scary on some notes Yeah,
especially if you're in metric or yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're yeah, we're fully there and it
is scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a It's a tough place to operate man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, I think whether it's the
economy Whether it's over saturation of
[SPEAKER_00]: this that and the other thing it's it's
tough You know, there's a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_00]: laying people off and just you know kind
of hitting this other downturn in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market and people aren't going into
retailers like they used to and I'm part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it like we can Again like taxation
things like that, you know, we can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get into that taxation over taxation Yeah,
it's just like yeah, like let us be
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive with the traditional market
and you know We'll be able to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: product out to the people and you know,
everybody wins and then again,
[SPEAKER_00]: where does the tax money go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I still see freaking tons of homeless
people out and just like it the roads are
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and it's like it's a that's a whole
can of worms, but Yeah, you're in Oakland
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay scary to do I mean compared to
how it used to be and I've been in Oakland
[SPEAKER_02]: my whole life And I just don't like
Oakland anymore in the sense that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's freaking wild there,
dude Yeah, it's getting wilder and wilder
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah I mean there's you know,
we've been broken into and robbed plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of times and You know, I tell people that
come it's just like yeah, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Not a matter if but when your
windows gonna get smashed make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: take your backpack I like, you know all
these noobs coming up and you know coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up from wherever even San Diego LA or just
people visiting I'm like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: you yeah, do not leave anything in your
car like It's gonna happen, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean just stores just broad daylight,
you know tons of retailers Like yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the lady that was on the news that
got carjacked in the end of catching the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that's guideline Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she had cameras and they used the
cameras to Identify the the thieves that
[SPEAKER_02]: carjacked her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean that's Skyline Boulevard and
that's like the nice part of Oakland Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it doesn't matter where you got to
have your head on the swivel out there
[SPEAKER_02]: dude for sure But it's still a beautiful
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I still love Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great You know, it's home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great hub and like very
welcoming city with cannabis I think like
[SPEAKER_00]: In the two fifteen days when we were kind
of operating then and you know I took
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of raids whether that be in like
Nevada County and we started the company
[SPEAKER_00]: in San Diego and it was super conservative
there and right, you know, like they were
[SPEAKER_00]: just coming after everybody like we had a
Small grow my brother had a dispensary we
[SPEAKER_00]: converted it to a delivery at a four
lighter dude tiny little grow Five
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand scripts like a whole collective
backing a four later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy and they still came in raided
I'm charged him with a felony,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they had to get a wobble
misdemeanor all this stuff But it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know that it was night and day
So, you know Oakland was always friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis and you know had an ordinance
for extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, I Did a lot of things
right when it came to cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization From medical transitioning
into rec and the way they wanted to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: green zone They looked at the PG&E bills
and they basically based the green zone on
[SPEAKER_00]: the PG&E Structure they let people come
into compliance like you could operate
[SPEAKER_00]: there You know kind of under the medical
guidelines and then they let you come into
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance, which was cool You know gave
everybody everybody that was old-school
[SPEAKER_00]: that wanted to give it a try a shot,
you know, which was nice Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Oakland's Yeah, kind of the birth
of a lot of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah No, it's been the hub and just you
know, everybody coming down off the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain like that's it was the place to
go That's where you went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the other side going big,
you know, I think Carbicide it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: the real big as far as also the focus that
the government had on Dispensaries because
[SPEAKER_02]: they were pushing the limit on what they
were doing They were making all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were getting scrutinized and
they were the model, you know and like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah as a grower and extractor to get your
product on that shelf back in the day was
[SPEAKER_00]: like You know, you felt like you made it
finally, you know Oh, I have stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a pain in the ass to deal with
to a degree though, and they didn't pay
[SPEAKER_02]: you right away I like places where you go
in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd slap the cash down and it was like
a Transaction where it wasn't like you get
[SPEAKER_02]: a little slip of paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah in two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like come pick your product Yeah,
you didn't after everybody's bucking to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there But yeah saying when we got I
had a dispensary in San Diego and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: very much like that where you know We'd
pay somebody on the spot and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we call them vendors you guys were vendors
back in the day and come in with your
[SPEAKER_00]: duffel bags and a bunch of different packs
a bunch of different flavors and pick two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three of the best peas and Pay us send
you on your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Harbor site would buy some decent
quantities Of stuff too and it's amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: how much product they move through there
and how much money they made back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day It was an amazing model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was yeah, it was one of a kind
first of its kind and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's It's interesting the way it all shook
out now But yeah, I mean you got to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them props for kind of breaking the mold
and you know helping you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry moved forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then even like so we can talk
about Purple Heart There was Purple Heart
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you went to Purple Heart
at all I was I was down south back then
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, I knew of it for sure Yeah,
and so they weren't harborside.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing their own thing and they
were but they were All about helping
[SPEAKER_02]: people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had really knowledgeable people
working there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a good buyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm Yeah, I didn't like I wasn't up
here that much like we were just come up
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of just basically would coming up
and grabbing You know this like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the meeting place everybody would
come off the mountain I'd come grab a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of packs for so Cal dispensaries and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So didn't spend too much time in the
clubs, you know up here, but right
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly a Hub in an epicenter for you
know, a lot of transaction and trade which
[SPEAKER_02]: was always fun Yeah, when did you get into
hash making and all the stuff that became
[SPEAKER_02]: Jetty?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said Jetty's been around
for about for ten years now in October
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a tenth year anniversary which
I'm stoked down because we're still here
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people aren't so at a
dispensary 2009-10 that got shut down by
[SPEAKER_00]: the feds sometime in 2011 civil they gave
us a letter said basically my landlord
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like we're gonna seize this
property unless you kick out your
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana tenant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so gave us a 45 day to cease and
desist so we moved all that to a delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of mentioned a delivery model and
had a couple grows spotted up around San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego and But you know when I had the
dispensary it was like talked about like
[SPEAKER_00]: our concentrate shelf like, you know being
just you know some full melts and just
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble and things like that and then
Towards the end like yeah 10 11 something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you know You'd start to see
like oils are like damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is this like amber oil and
sometimes it'd be poop soup like dark
[SPEAKER_00]: gross shit, but We really didn't know how
to smoke it and what to do with it yet and
[SPEAKER_00]: then, you know, I saw like a really shitty
vaporizer pen like it was like with glycol
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cotton way Yeah, it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was just terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still have my gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, this is fucking cool
and it's gonna probably be something but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not something yet, but it really
sparked my interest right and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: really seeing like our concentrate shelf
at the dispensary go from like You know a
[SPEAKER_00]: little slice and a little bit of market
share a little bit of sales and it got
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and bigger and bigger and in more
variety and more offerings and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like weird like honey buds and this
and that and like all these different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Like fun stuff like people were
doing and it started evolving and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a lot of like the glass Blowing
homies were like, yeah, we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: blow like a fucking bong or a pipe anymore
Everybody wants these rigs do like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just selling these rigs and people are
coming in the dispensary asking for rigs
[SPEAKER_00]: and nails and bangers and this and that,
you know, and you know the the method of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and vaporizing and dabbing really
kind of took on and we're just like wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is like Becoming a huge category and
this is like there barely was any brands
[SPEAKER_00]: back then man It was just like strain
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple like mom-and-pop cookie
companies that were like edible brands But
[SPEAKER_02]: there wasn't really much branding then
when there's two big glass companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember is hitman glass and silica
Yeah, those two brands kind of had the
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm Yeah, they definitely did and like
I think yeah hitman Dougie and like though
[SPEAKER_00]: that crew definitely had a lot to do with
kind of like Evolving the method of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking which really helped evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah totally He's an amazing guy,
you know Chalice and yeah, he's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he keeps reinventing himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's back here He's doing some events now
to pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah kudos to like all them old-school
folks, man They really like helped pioneer
[SPEAKER_00]: and pave the way for what it is now and it
was really cool to see that evolution Like
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, but yeah, really that's kind of
how we got into it is like got shut down
[SPEAKER_00]: by the feds What are we gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to find a safe way to do
extraction because everybody's either
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing up their garages by open blasting
doing stupid shit or Getting like these
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy charges which was like I don't know
like the same charge you'd get if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: A meth lab intent to manufacture or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what it was but bad
felony So we thought oh co2 safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my partner and two partners back then
but you know one came in he was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Had some real estate money sold and you
know, basically he's like yeah I'll throw
[SPEAKER_00]: down for a co2 machine and we didn't know
what the fuck we're doing So that was like
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of the first thing and was this pre
like Eden lab co2 It was right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time those apex co2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like those were the two I think
the first co2 I saw was an Eden thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a we had a grow in a two-story
building But the tenant was like leasing
[SPEAKER_02]: it to all cannabis so apex had turps still
whereas the Eden was like crude Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the orange peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah some really weird Consistencies would
come out of that and like just how waxy it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah high pressures and the heat Mostly
wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh I got a huge yield and
it's like fucking 30% You know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, it was certainly, you know not
the best method of extraction but What you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, once we winterized it and it worked
really well, you know, it didn't have good
[SPEAKER_00]: turf profile But it got to a good
consistency or a pen and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: really got us like we're kind of just
focused on extracts in general But having
[SPEAKER_00]: that co2 rig kind of got us You know more
into selling more vapes and more pens
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the only thing we really
make from that machine So it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved I guess, you know naturally from
there Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so and that was ten years ago and
then you started out just doing co2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: that evolved you did that for five years
maybe yeah, probably, you know It was a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years of co2 and then you know kind
of went into the ethanol distillate thing
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrocarbon live resin because we had to
wait for like licensing and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know every couple years it seemed
like we evolved to a different type of
[SPEAKER_00]: type of extraction Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah as the market changed you were kind
of on the cutting edge of what's new and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying it out Tried to be you know,
like a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it was just kind of We you
know, we may have pigeonholed ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: into a few methods that you know looking
back on it it got us where we are today,
[SPEAKER_00]: but You know, the good thing is we never
like overbuilt for anything like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some Mega co2 labs or mega ethanol labs
that are out there that you know Basically
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting sold off for parts right now
because no one's using those methods So we
[SPEAKER_00]: were at least pivoting every couple years
knowing there's gonna be a new trend or
[SPEAKER_02]: new tech coming out, you know Yeah,
those are like the cool tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the quest was to really make
something that Tasted as good or better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the flower, you know So that was kind
of always the mission and why we evolved I
[SPEAKER_02]: think nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, would you like to try some?
[SPEAKER_03]: Banana skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude Nice some fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a Banana og times banana punch
then back to the skittles and phenyl
[SPEAKER_02]: hunted by My good friends house of
cultivar in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so they're doing all kinds of fun
stuff with extraction up there and I'm big
[SPEAKER_02]: fan of the live resin with this plant,
but it's it's very open bud structure I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if you remember Williams wonder
where it was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah nice Okay, where the Brax really
stuck up in Fox tail kind of like sour Fox
[SPEAKER_02]: tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that structure man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know sometimes You know,
like the nice tight pretty nug is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I like it when it does its own
thing, you know, kind of like weird Not
[SPEAKER_03]: bad, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely get the skittles in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah It's skittly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's The flower actually
smells kind of pungent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, but you don't get the pungency
with the extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me smell it
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got a little more skittles To
it for sure Yeah, and I like it skittles
[SPEAKER_02]: structure is always bad like If you want
to it's a hard one like to get to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: well, right for us and hit numbers But the
bananas definitely will work good Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a fine line with there's a little
banana in there I got more of the skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure Nice the plant when you
squeeze some of the expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just straight like banana og like
that really Banana og nice and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: banana punch those plants get so big so
you can you can really see the different
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you look at the skittles You take
the three plants because they definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: all have different structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're looking at the progeny you
can really see What was inherited from
[SPEAKER_02]: which parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't spend nearly enough time and in
the grow room in the fields as I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it's That's a cool thing about the
whole, you know how the extract seems
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving and how we're You know more in
cahoots with the farmer and the producer
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cultivator then than ever before
and just like, you know breeding more for
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction and saltless genetics and stuff
like that There's just a lot more data
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing and like, you know We're looking
at calyxes and we're looking at trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: together and it's fun, man Yeah and
breeding for specific types of extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like guns it's not like you're
reading for everything it's not yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: Across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, so there's some fun fun new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think yeah, that's the thing that
excites me the most is just What new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains are on the forefront, you know for
sure, you know, I think lemon cherry and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think these gelato Derivatives they have
their place, but I think I see over in New
[SPEAKER_02]: York.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really happy with the PIF They're
going hard with like some of this the
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa varieties these hazes Yeah,
totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great to have the
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't always want to smoke a haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to smoke a haze on this show
necessarily Done that before and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like one of these joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have a ceiling man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could just keep Some of them creep up
you on you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you'll smoke it I mean,
it just keeps you getting getting you more
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just yeah, we just don't see it
out here, man I wish there was more hazes
[SPEAKER_02]: available and there's little markets like
niche market like gold seal in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco They do their the Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that Congo's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good one It's a good one and I
think that would that hop late in two for
[SPEAKER_02]: a while and I'm not sure if they
remediated or not Yeah, we were you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a kind of some friends of ours
operating out of our facility Oakland
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts and they were really like
old-school Oakland OG's and pick up the
[SPEAKER_00]: Terran but Yeah, they were rocking that
gear for a while always getting the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: seal Congo and it was just man It had just
such a cool profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah gets you super stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm as yeah, it's it's strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strong in effect But that's one thing
where I had a I had a big bag of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: over the period of a week your body Really
starts to get used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even the strongest stuff you can
build a tolerance to yeah, absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and that's one thing like if you're
used to doing dabs or you're used to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking I feel like the difference between
the two if you switch to the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, I don't smoke flour for a while
and frickin ripped off a giant Totally
[SPEAKER_02]: nice smoke some skittles and also yeah But
but yeah, whereas I'm the same way whereas
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been mostly smoking flour lately
We've been going through a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a lot of selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm always trying new stuff So I'm
always getting high for that for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part But then I go to take a dab or I even
just hitting, you know Do it doing one of
[SPEAKER_02]: these cold starts that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I can get ripped off those
pretty easily Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally feel that yeah and even
strain to strain, you know just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: way you build tolerances is enough I think
we're just like learning more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: about and right, you know, but yeah,
I mean I'll switch smoke and whatever OG
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole time and then just switch to
something that's You'd think is
[SPEAKER_00]: lightweight and mellow, but just got that
different terpene profile or whatever hits
[SPEAKER_00]: you totally different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, when people ask me what was my
favorite thing to smoke is it's like I
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of different things But
whatever the best is right now because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a fresh product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like And they're usually
like obviously whatever I have that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: best is the one I want to smoke the most
of and I might have a bunch of Different
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors and then all of a sudden I get a
bunch of this I might smoke all of that
[SPEAKER_02]: before I go back into anything else Yeah,
just because I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way it makes me feel and yeah
Yeah, I'd say like gas man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know being in San Diego and so Cal
for like so long in the early days It's
[SPEAKER_00]: just og og og.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see cat piss back in the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: So was the cat piss more like og gas or
was it more like skunk like roadkill
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah more skunk by Little citrus to it
than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean there was like the so Cal
there was the nor Cal and everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: arguing over what cat piss is and My
argument is the cat piss is a flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: profile and I've seen it come up as
expressions and stuff a five for instance
[SPEAKER_02]: a five the a five haze is Definitely like
it's similar profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's yeah, I mean it's cat piss But
it doesn't smoke as pissy in a month It
[SPEAKER_02]: still has like but on the nose it is
ammonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that was cat piss was like
skunky ammonia without the gas It wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: gas like og or chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like this foul skunky Ammonia and
it would stink up a little tenth of a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: would smell the whole room up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love those Yeah, there is a couple
guys like closet guys back in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I grew up that had like that
funk and it was just yeah I don't it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'd walk into like a bar or crowded
room people be like what the fuck are you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd you know, and yeah, like you just
don't you don't see that you don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: that anymore now Everybody smells like we
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we're all used to it I don't get the
airport and I smell weed and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that me and then I realize it's
somebody else Yeah, it's so nice to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to go to airports and like I have to
worry as much Yeah, I don't know everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Oakland Airport smells like weed
Yeah, I mean I've seen people yeah go in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out of there and through TSA and
they're looking at it This that this bag
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed and put it back and send them on
their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's amazing So what do you see
as the future of the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot, I wish I had the crystal ball for
that one day me too Hard to say man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we're in like survival mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of the you know
regulated Folks like ourselves are just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to survive Well, you're still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're think ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean What's the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see just an Actual,
you know, it was crazy like back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day we were drug dealers and then it was
like a movement we're like fighting for
[SPEAKER_00]: just cannabis To be legal and now it's
like Here and it's legal, but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: in its infancy Like federal government
might be doing some rescheduling like that
[SPEAKER_02]: just came out which is I don't necessarily
like it They're scheduling it to a
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's schedule tobacco as a schedule
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's my opinion I don't want to be
in the same category as heroin and frickin
[SPEAKER_00]: cocaine So I'm glad it's moving out of
schedule one, but I agree with this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduling things It's a little silly for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think if we're gonna do that,
let's go ahead and schedule tobacco as
[SPEAKER_02]: well Yeah, I think that's a good point,
you know, because I think tobacco is my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion is way worse for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm You know, and it doesn't get me
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying Like, yeah,
I mean switch the tobacco industry to like
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD flower, you know, everybody's gonna be
mellow and just Yeah, not getting lung
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expectorant makes you know,
so there's there's a lot of benefits to
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's Unfortunately, the tobacco
industry probably has too much money to
[SPEAKER_00]: lobby against going on any sort of
schedule for that Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the last podcast I did we talked
actually the one that's airing with Heston
[SPEAKER_02]: we were talking about the lobbyists Yeah,
and you know, unfortunately, there's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of lobbyists for the home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah small guys small companies Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and whether they're evil or not,
I'm not gonna speak to that but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them I don't think I have the best
intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know if it's like it's it's
not a Good and evil thing for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just money They're looking at the
money and you know, we can look at it as
[SPEAKER_02]: good and evil or whatever And they're just
worried about the bottom line like how can
[SPEAKER_02]: we make the most out of money?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not always the best approach in
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do fucked up shit to make the most
amount of money so when you start focusing
[SPEAKER_02]: on money, you're willing to sacrifice
things like To make your product quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it can go in any extreme and
consumer safety, you know, I mean like you
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrifice that or knowingly Spray
something with a pesticide, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was cancer causing but you're still
gonna put it on your product anyway cuz
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cheaper Yeah, so like that side of
it's not great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it's it's not great But there's
always the thing is is I feel like the
[SPEAKER_02]: truth comes out with that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm The truth comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day people start
recognizing the good brands and what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're doing and the efforts They're
making towards it when you get a following
[SPEAKER_02]: and that builds up over time that it takes
years to build a brand properly for people
[SPEAKER_02]: that think they're just gonna start
cultivating and Open extract company or a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed company and just right off the gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes years To really do it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a lot of these guys that just big
MSOs open up, you know, whatever They can
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred thousand square foot indoor
facilities all around the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, there's nothing good coming out of
there cuz no It's not easy to do man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way better to sort of small Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm and do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah as far as the future of the
industry, you know, I mean, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna become more normalized I think you
know, you're gonna be able to go to hotels
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know on the little minibar menu,
you're gonna have your spliff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's gonna be just more
access I mean will 7-eleven be selling
[SPEAKER_00]: joints at some point probably in our
lifetime, you know, so yeah, so You know
[SPEAKER_00]: and there'll be craft scenes in different
types of events and tastings and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that so I think I'm excited for that
side of it and like it to normalize and
[SPEAKER_00]: people to consume more cannabis like I
think is obviously gonna be great for the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, but right, you know just surviving
and you know Making sure the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: stays somewhat has some integrity at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is gonna be important and kind of
like Keeps me going, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were to give yourself one piece
of advice back when you started Looking
[SPEAKER_02]: back at yourself that you know,
you've been in the industry one or two
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what advice would you give yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm Man a lot of lessons learned I guess I
would say just
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for go bigger man, like don't be scared
to Kind of step out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially back in the day it was like
stick and move a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of like We're scared to
really go for it or really brand your
[SPEAKER_00]: product and stuff like that but seeing
other people that have come out with like
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting branding and just kind of like
going for You know getting their stuff out
[SPEAKER_00]: there more, you know Like exactly what you
guys are doing a lot of these genetic guys
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that Like the seeds guys
have been doing it for a long time and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing cannabis out into the world and I
think like going back I just push more
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis out into the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, yeah, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes the world a better place
Yeah, I think we all do that's why we're
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but yeah I remember getting seed
packs like way back when and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: sketchy and you had it, you know,
dude sent it to somebody's house and this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that but you know, like they've been
doing it forever and just like pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: out and just I think that's what I do more
of right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a Interesting process from
where we were, you know, I was born in 78
[SPEAKER_02]: or 77 so from 77 even Now it's pretty wild
the cannabis industry and still relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: new and yeah, it's young dude Yeah,
we're talking about I don't know who's
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about about like probe it
comparing it to prohibition of alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day to now so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's way more regulation
There's you know, all these covering,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was no OSHA and shit like
that back then Four big there's four big
[SPEAKER_02]: companies out of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're allowed to brew beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the big four Yeah, and they're
still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they're still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah exactly, but it wasn't until the 70s
and Yeah until we had these micro brews
[SPEAKER_02]: coming online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So that's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's uh, yeah, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean I think It's come a long
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to really know what the future
holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know and eventually just like
Trying to make good product and put it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there to the people I think is the best
thing we can do totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm Well, man, it was really great
having you on the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody has a question on where they
can find you guys How can they get in
[SPEAKER_02]: touch with you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can they find you dispensary wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I couldn't say we're in a good
amount of dispensaries in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Colorado We're likely gonna be in
New Jersey by the end of the year MSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so Small I mean,
I don't know if like we are that but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, we're are well you're in multiple
states You are technically in MSO,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're a good MSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally Yeah, so yeah, but yeah,
we're trying to get our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very like heavy touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there We're producing it in those
markets, you know with partners and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a hard thing It's not like a gummy
where you just give somebody a recipe and
[SPEAKER_00]: here you go Here's my recipe sugar this
that and the other thing and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and here's my product so right
especially Solvent list and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun being in those markets So in
any of those markets, but you can check
[SPEAKER_00]: our website.

[SPEAKER_00]: think the other day so kudos to the
marketing team for Getting that back on
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, it's not the first time
