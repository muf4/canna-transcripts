[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
flower podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today our special guest is Derek from
planta.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Derek grows amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Freddy from planta.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought the 11 coffins and coffin candy
to my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two hottest things,
in my opinion, for 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away because I feel like they
fit the bill with candy, but they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: like the other candies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something special about both of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're their own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we worked really hard bringing
them to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know better than anybody how
feno hunting goes, breeding, all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those two were bred by a duke of herb,
a rusty duke of geosia.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did 100 seeds of the coffin candy
and the 11 coffins.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and this was feno number eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 11 coffins, we did a 400 seed feno
hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was RS 11 times coffin candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we selected number 178.
[SPEAKER_06]: And shout out to Freddy for smoking every
single one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I am the grower, but at the end of
the day, things that go in the jar,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's in control of, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He makes all the decisions on that end.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has the palette, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he was on our show, he proved that he
could smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire time he was on here,
he was chief and hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's talk about your relationship
with Freddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you guys meet?
[SPEAKER_06]: So me and Freddy met, I'd say probably 12,
13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were both fighting, training
professionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: MMA at Team Alpha Male.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very organic relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, both trying to achieve something
in the fighting world.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're both growing weed and selling weed
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so started doing a little bit of
business back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was also like a big influence in my
fighting career.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was one of my corner men for pretty
much the last five professional fights I
[SPEAKER_06]: had, which we won all five of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: By knockout or submission on everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, him helping me prepare for
fights, also working on the side together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you're getting ready for a
professional fight, you're cutting weight,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're doing all these things,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot of discipline and like it's
very mentally draining.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like having someone in your corner
that's there that, you know, is helping
[SPEAKER_06]: you cut weight, do all these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you develop a real bond with
those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was like and we were working and
like he really was the one that like
[SPEAKER_06]: pushed me to brand my weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because shortly after I retired from
fighting when I was like 25, moved down to
[SPEAKER_06]: L.A., had a hundred lighter and was just
like putting out fire, fire packs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, bro, you need to brand
these, you need to brand these.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, at the time I was already
white labeling for some of the biggest
[SPEAKER_06]: brands in L.A., like in the in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like getting top dollar for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I don't want to have to do
all this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, like branding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'm just going to keep white
labeling for these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, like, for me, it was just about I
enjoy being in the garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, everything was just like I
just want to grow the weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to be the brand guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't wear all those hats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't want to wear all the hats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, growing weed is, you know,
it's hard to grow really good weed,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me, it just clicks with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for me, I can just walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can walk into any grow in America and be
like, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, my ears are tuned in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that de-hue is misfiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there's a leak in that line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm just zoned in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done it for so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: So doing the branding thing, being out in
the public eye, doing all of that didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: really catch my interest back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, you know, twenty twenty-one
comes around and the market just tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-COVID, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were making money during COVID,
you were doing so wrong.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say the end of twenty-one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The end of twenty-one, the market just
tanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, still serving these
brands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're still getting, you know,
top dollar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, OK, now it's time to start
the brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at the end of the day,
you could have the same strain from the
[SPEAKER_06]: same facility, from the same room.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy can sell it at, you know,
three times the price of the guy just
[SPEAKER_06]: white labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he's putting it in his bag or in
his jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same exact flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same exact flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of a mine and Freddie's
relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've just been, you know,
we were racking up wins together fighting
[SPEAKER_06]: and now we're racking up wins.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that kind of space.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and then between your guys,
it's like you got a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you brought some of the stuff
today, but I've also seen your Gelato 41,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that Cleopatra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it's like there's a lot of
Gelato 41 on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to have a better Gelato 41 where
it's like, oh, yeah, I mean, it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it when it has a little bit of
color and larger buds, it yields more
[SPEAKER_01]: typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got to be sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is, like,
I see a lot of Gelato 41 on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's not this or it's missing one of
the boxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I don't know if they have a
bag seed or this, but like my Gelato 41,
[SPEAKER_06]: my Gelinate, my Biscotti are like the
original or original strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like we talked a little bit before the
podcast, like I TC all of our genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have your own lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a hood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a hood.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I have a hood.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the whole little lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just to be able to use the
Athena.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: The packets?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I was doing my own agar
doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once they released that and it worked,
I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, they really tried or not
even tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really simplified the tissue culture
model for the average person that wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's great for scale,
obviously, but no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: For doing small scale, I think it's very
approachable and affordable for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish they would have came out
without like two years prior to me buying
[SPEAKER_06]: a hood and all this stuff because it would
have been a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and they're VPD domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were kind of talking about that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the VPD domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're good for tissue culture
and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of, you know,
Athena's got good branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got good branding and marketing,
but then they have some good products to
[SPEAKER_01]: back it up and they're super consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I feel like anything in cannabis,
like you're just looking for the
[SPEAKER_06]: consistency, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you already have take out like a
large facility, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have 12 employees.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have mechanical malfunctions every
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: AC is going out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, to be honest, like if you've ran a
large scale cultivation every day,
[SPEAKER_06]: something's breaking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something new every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something new.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a fire to put out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I always tell people, like,
you know, people come to me with like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, adjustable spectrum lights or this or
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, dude, I don't want any of my
cultivation managers trying to adjust a
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum because they think this or they
think that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 56 light recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try them out.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I always tell people, like,
find a product that works and just do
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, like you said, they have
consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the thing is always super
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of the most consistent brands
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, and it's like like it or
hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consistency is there across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and that's what makes good
brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's flower, whether it's
lighting, whether, you know, it's all it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all about like consistency is so important
when you're building a brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially a flower brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like and with where we're at right now in
the country with like the recession,
[SPEAKER_06]: things like that, like that's like one of
our goals as a brand is like always always
[SPEAKER_06]: have a consistent product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like my main office is at my at the
distro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I QC personally QC every single batch.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Making sure like, you know, it's five.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two to five nugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our SOP on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Making sure that every single pack that
goes into it is the best pack of the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when that I want the customer,
when they smoke, they buy a jar at the
[SPEAKER_06]: store because they're spending their hard
earned money.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: To have the same experience I have when I
leave my facility, you know, have a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: of nugs from a premium picked batch and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like consistency means a lot in this
industry and it means a lot while,
[SPEAKER_06]: like you said, developing a brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be a brand that you can trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like look at CBX for for example,
they have 10 strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: They run the same ones every time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They hardly do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do any marketing hardly fucking
crush it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still selling thirty dollar eights to the
store all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no exceptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crush it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been in the market for a long
time, but also have always just been very
[SPEAKER_06]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you develop your customer
base is based on consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they know they can get the same thing
going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's good one time and bad the
next, you're only as good as your last
[SPEAKER_01]: batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as it's consistent,
you're OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I saw some of the brands early
on in rec 2018 coming in the market
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot of money behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot of branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the flower sucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you buy that one time and it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to buy it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never going to buy it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like that, you know, and I still
buy rec flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I got some of your flower on the
rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Cookies Hayward and I went to
Cookies Hayward and got your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the first day it dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was shopping there with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like, planta, you got planta
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's caught me by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Cookies Hayward, we got planta.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're like, yeah, this stuff,
it sells out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sells out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sells out right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm like, OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it right when it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that is also so important
that the product moves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it sits on the shelf for six weeks,
eight weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just gets worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't have, not all the
places have controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the future is like,
control distribution where they're keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: it refrigerated all the way till it gets
to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's in the dispensary, they keep it
at a cool temperature so it stays as fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do they display their weed too,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of the oxidation,
all those things happen under those lights
[SPEAKER_06]: that they have in the cases, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they have all of it, like if they
have everything laid out in the case,
[SPEAKER_06]: and people have clear jars, then those
lights are just beaming on it all day,
[SPEAKER_06]: all night probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that makes the weed oxidize a lot
faster, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I notice a lot of guys have fancy
jars that are die, or fancy bags that are
[SPEAKER_01]: die cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys went with the jars that are
opaque.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the, I feel like they're
original.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went with that so the weed wouldn't
get crushed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I said, I'm in the grow room every
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: These plants are like my babies,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get on my trimmers crazy if they even
fucking knock off one trichome or like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, shave a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to hold it by the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to hold it by the stem,
tips only.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I have a really good trim
team.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have, you know, our facilities are
dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use scissors, you use brush,
you use finger trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Scissors only.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scissors only.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chica Masas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiskars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chica Masas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chica Masas.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chica Masas, the bent tip ones that get in
there every crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, and every facility has its
purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like our facilities here in Oakland,
that's all commercial weed, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, thousands of lights,
commercial weed, our facilities in LA,
[SPEAKER_06]: that is, you know, all for the brand,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Having the trimmers dialed in,
having everyone dialed in to put the best
[SPEAKER_06]: weed in the jar, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you control the environment that you
guys trim in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both places?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 degrees, 60% humidity-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 to 65.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we dry 60, 60, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, here at the Oakland facilities,
my LA facilities, everything is DPS
[SPEAKER_06]: panels.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Oakland facilities, it was a retrofit
facility, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they retrofitted it due to the old
building.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to get it done faster, they didn't do
the DPS panels.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a great facility, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But the swings are a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's big swings because the roof is an
insulated, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not, you know, you use a DPS panels,
you're a building inside of a building,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one we're playing to the elements,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as we're watching the weather,
like right now, you know, we're having big
[SPEAKER_06]: swings, but as long as we're watching
that, adjusting our temps, humidities
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout, it's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we try to shoot for 60,
60, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that I believe that's like the best
way to cure and dry weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then you cure it out for a
little bit longer after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys burp it or do you?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we buck it all down into bins and then
it goes to the trimmers and the bags get
[SPEAKER_06]: burped for, you know, I'd say probably a
week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once the trim is done,
then it just goes into production of
[SPEAKER_06]: either it's going into the jars or
depending what facility it's at,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's going into the distro and then being
bulked out or white labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever tried Grove bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're turplocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have tried Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the planta, if it's going to the
jars, I want it in a loose bag,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it to, and it just gets jarred
immediately, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's going to bulk and white label,
it's just like the price doesn't make
[SPEAKER_06]: sense for bulking it out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive for a bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's expensive for a bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ideally, yes, it's an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are using bags, I would use Grove
bags, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like their bin liners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have bin liners too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a good product, I think,
especially for long-term stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got rid of most of my jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is getting smashed
because I have a backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bring my flower around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, that's the only downside
is that it gets smashed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of what I was trying to go
into is just that like getting a run all
[SPEAKER_06]: the way through, getting it to the
trimmers, getting it coming out perfect,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then throwing it in a bag and getting
crushed, it's like heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because you're like, your client
gets it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They pick it up at, they pick this jar up,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They see it, they're like, wow,
this looks really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when I do do bags or when we
have done it in the past, you get the
[SPEAKER_06]: clear gusset, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least your client can see it on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too smashed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's hard to sell weed, especially
for your thing, these bud tenders,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't let you smell it, typically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they can't let you smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like deli style how it used to
be, which is like, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with the chopsticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that was the best, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: LA, that was the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best part about going to all
the dispensaries in LA is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get to smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the chopsticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They break it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not touching it with their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're weighing it right in front of you
so you know you're not getting ripped off,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those good things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would allow cannabis brands to
shine more, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because how many times, especially now,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have so many, with legalization,
with all these things happening,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have so many new smokers, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they come in and they don't know what
to buy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they get the shiny bag or they get
this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they go home and they have a bad
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to come back and shop?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to continue to do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, are they going to continue to go
down their weed journey, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, you truly don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And having deli style was so beneficial
because.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weed speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you don't have to sell the weed
in fancy packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sell the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can make their mind up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they maybe don't taste it,
but then they get home and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh yeah, this is what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks amazing, smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a letdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that there's going to be like that
kind of stuff throughout the, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, always, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, having a bag where they
can't see the flower like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you want every sensory detail,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be able to touch it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be able to smell it when you
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be able to taste it,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like if they're not able to even
see it before they buy it, especially on
[SPEAKER_06]: like right now, you know, we're in a
recession, like people are spending their
[SPEAKER_06]: hard earned money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like if they're spending you know,
top shelf, eight, fifty five dollars,
[SPEAKER_06]: sixty dollars pre tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they go home and have a terrible
fucking experience or they open the bag
[SPEAKER_06]: and like, oh, wow, this is not what I
expected.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're going to have a bad
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like our whole goal is to make sure
the smoker is having an experience that I
[SPEAKER_06]: have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at least what you're in control of
providing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, you know, with the rec market,
it's tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like these shops want a lot to help from
from the brand to help sell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a smaller brand, like we're you know,
it's me, a couple of people like in our in
[SPEAKER_06]: our facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, our distro team and
everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like we all work really hard to
make sure these experiences go well with
[SPEAKER_06]: the customers, making sure that our bud
tenders are, you know, trained.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it all gets hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and being a bud tender is tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's there's so many
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just because it says biscotti,
it does not mean there's so much cut
[SPEAKER_01]: fishing that goes on within our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, where people are like,
oh, yeah, here's RS 11.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first RS 11 that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I was so excited with 11
coffins, because the first RS 11 was this
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe 2018, 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was 2019 and it was graded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the first group really,
truly graded all even sized buds across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had almost a pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pinkish tint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you open the bag, it was like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gassy, but it was almost like
smelling fresh ice cream or like sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not like Sunset Sherbert,
but like actual sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an ice cream shop and it's like
hits you in the face.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, you see, you say sherbert
like actual sherbert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it had like that pink and it had the
orange hairs like it was like a pinkish
[SPEAKER_01]: tint.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like they're super golf ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Circular buds.
Super.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they came out perfectly
graded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first time I saw like
perfectly graded flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was so excited about forty five
hundred dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as they expanded, it changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also other cuts got out and
people I think a lot of people don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know what real RS 11 is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that goes across the board with
so many different genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the hard thing when bringing a
strain to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like even with our strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of our strains that we feel hunted
like they will never leave our facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything like I could easily bring them up
to the Oakland facilities and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, blow them out, have like,
you know, a lot of weed to bring to
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's three thousand lights,
three different facilities, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: total of probably like 30 or 40 workers
that are going to be in those rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And anything can happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people will pay a lot of money
for a cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like and I feel like that's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what happened across the board to so
many people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: My team at the plant facilities at my
facilities in L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: have been working with me for eight years
plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Twenty twenty fifteen till now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nine years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all have a vision of what we want and
we are all invested in that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like no one could pay them any amount of
money to take something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like I trust those guys in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like family when you build that
culture at work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that money just
can't buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture is one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, within the cannabis
industry, but especially within the
[SPEAKER_01]: workplace, when you have people that feel
like they're part of the team,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're a contributing member,
they love coming to work every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can't beat that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like those guys and that's the
difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Work culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you want to develop a space where
people want to come to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we're all working towards the same
goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, you know, how do you do
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like as cultivators, like it's very
monotonous work sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like day in, day out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing day in, day out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, looking at graphs, adjusting
feeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have a few big days of
Harvard, a cycle, you know, you have your
[SPEAKER_06]: repop, you have your undercut,
your default and your chop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, it's monotonous data
points.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, logging data, adjusting your
feeds off of that data.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, how do you keep them
incentivized and doing a better job every
[SPEAKER_06]: single time?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of goes into like my slogan
for like, like pursuing perfection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like every single run, every single task I
want.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to challenge my guys and I try to
develop that like ethos at our grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like every, like this round of cuts should
be better than last round.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's never, it's never done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The job is never done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always trying to improve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many different ways you can
improve it over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see the best facilities out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have that same mentality that it's
like, it's never perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best growers are like that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never, even when it's the best batch
SF Kana, you know, it's like those guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have that same mentality that you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, the job's never done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it could always be improved upon in
some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're always striving for that,
you're going to hit higher every time,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when it's not as good, you're still
going to get a good product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I feel like that's the only way
that brands or facilities are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: survive going forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you see rows for sale every day right
now, LA, Oakland, and it's just like
[SPEAKER_06]: people get in it and they're like,
Oh, we can make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, the market's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unless you're producing top quality
weed, you're not going to be here and
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you're competing with the guys
who can produce it for 250 to $300 a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how you can't compete with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if your costs are too high,
which most people are because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing at that scale, you're in the same
market as those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's, there's no way you're going
to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to lose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's, you know, even
geographically, it's a challenge,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like growing in downtown LA is 10 times
more expensive than growing in Adelanto.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, yeah, those guys producing
for 350 a pound, 300 a pound indoor in
[SPEAKER_06]: Adelanto paying way less in electricity,
paying way less in either a lease or
[SPEAKER_06]: mortgage or any of those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy, but getting your numbers down
and making sure you're producing under
[SPEAKER_06]: $500 a pound LA should be between like
five to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I think six is like the norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like six is where, you know, if you're
getting less than that, I have guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing three, you know, those guys are
crushing double stack and they're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: three pounds of light, you know,
and then, then it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even still, you can't just grow a
grade product anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a grade doesn't cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need an A plus, you need a triple
plus, you need the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can't just grow lemon cherry
gelato either.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing you won't see in our
jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like I said, everything has its
place, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the commercial, our commercial
facilities where we're pumping out a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of work for a lot of other brands and
distros, like 10 different types of candy,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for a brand, I think you need to come
with new genetics often and try to create
[SPEAKER_06]: a staple, staple genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you look at people like, oh,
you know, look at biscotti, look at gel
[SPEAKER_06]: and they like, look at all these,
you know, connected strains like that are
[SPEAKER_06]: just like staples, lifetime staples before
that OG, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like sour diesel, which we were talking
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't forget cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can not forget cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like shout out to burner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to cookies for like really
creating the branding wave for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, the flower, the back to two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't yield very well and real
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people talk down on
cookies cause they don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they weren't there, but when cookies
hit the market, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tastes amazing and it's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a heavy smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not like Skittles,
which I love Skittles, but Skittles is
[SPEAKER_01]: much lighter and more melodic daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you smoke some really good
cookies and it's super sedative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still smoke it down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all the good qualities,
checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was one of the ones that kind
of developed the boxes, especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: that purple, you know, and then,
you know, cause before that was OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Bubba OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: You went to LA right before that hit and
you couldn't get anything but OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was 28 different types of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think Josh had several different
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of places in Kenji.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these guys had, you know,
and there is a difference between SFV and
[SPEAKER_01]: like the original OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Diablo's a little bit different and
same thing with the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all good in their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like a good gassy that has pine
needles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: SFV is like super gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: SFV does not breed well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot reverse it and expect to get
pollen out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so stable and it's just difficult to
work with, but like it's super,
[SPEAKER_01]: super, super special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smoke is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just something about the earthy pine
needle with the citrus on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you find breeding that the more finicky
the strains are to breed with like
[SPEAKER_06]: skittles, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, or like you're saying the SFV OG is
like, do you find like that those are
[SPEAKER_06]: harder to breed with typically?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like growing skittles, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Super finicky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super finicky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even cloning it is super finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of these things have recessive
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even if you do sell skittles,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You make S1s of skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a silliest thing when people are
selling S1s of skittles because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is like the ones that
have the structure will, will definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: smell and taste like skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for the structure,
but you're not going to find anything
[SPEAKER_01]: better than skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to find anything better
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all that work, you will never find
anything better than the parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the OGs have recessive
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you breed with that OG,
that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a difficult time finding
something that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the cookies and OG craze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that happened that I was on that
bandwagon, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all about OG times cookies because
cookies didn't yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was like a bunch of OGs that
yielded really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The platinum that does what I work with,
with cookies and it gave it the gassiness,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also brought it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas they both had it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get two things that are
recessive, you can get it to express,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's only on one side of it,
a lot of times you're not going to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: to express.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love working with those plants and I
love trying to figure stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times people are like,
Oh, I crossed this and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on paper, it sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to buy seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you pop the seeds and you're not,
you're not finding anything that you
[SPEAKER_01]: thought was in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, I feel like everyone like
was skittles, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, like the cookies times OG
everyone, cause because it is so finicky,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're like, wow, if I could get this
smell and taste, but something,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cross it with, you know,
like an OG or even OG is pretty finicky
[SPEAKER_06]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's hard to do that, but like an
apple fritter or like something,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that's like super vigorous or G
41.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: G 41 is a great example of something to
breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a skittles times G 41 back to
the skittles and we're doing some back
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with that, but it's like,
you're not finding stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding some really interesting stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a really sick skittles back cross
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think it's gotta be different
than skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people were just chasing diet skittles,
there's no point because it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a skittles BX two or skittles BX
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a skittles time skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm strawberry Scalato.
[SPEAKER_06]: So strawberry Scalato is a gelato 33 times
18 coffins, which is a, it's a OG 18 cross
[SPEAKER_06]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OG 18 from DNA cross to the coffin cut of
strawberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the ZBX two is also bred by Duke
herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a firm believer in his seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run a lot of his gear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the ZBX two that we're
launching, uh, we're going to call it
[SPEAKER_06]: Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, no, cause it's my favorite bar
is Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Barcelona, parody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the top bars in Europe and in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like the number two bar in
the world for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You going to Spanavis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, last year, you need to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go, we'll go, we'll go this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's a hidden back room.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll smoke Paradiso at Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a must.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, they have a hidden back room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to set it up, get it, get
reservations for it and rent it out for a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain amount of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they let you smoke back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say they don't, but then you like
money talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bartenders, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, Barcelona is a great city.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually like, I've been there two
times.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, one for Spanavis one time,
uh, just on a vacation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, yeah, me and my wife say like,
I could easily just live there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know how to live there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's like one of the cities I used
to, we travel, we travel a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, and very few places I'm like,
Oh, I could live here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I could definitely live there and
they have like a flourishing cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like very, very interesting out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like Amsterdam too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam has it, but Barcelona has the
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather's sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a couple of good weeks of
weather per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but if you like kickboxing,
they got great martial arts there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad motherfuckers come from there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they got good jujitsu there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They breed beasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is these guys are so tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have long limbs and long limbs
are great for kickboxing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a, yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did MA in Muay Thai.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I lived in Thailand for just under a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got an AKA or where?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I went to, uh, sponsored by Tiger Muay
Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I sponsored by Tiger Muay Thai.
[SPEAKER_06]: I stayed there, uh, lived on the camp,
fought for them professionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, had three Muay Thai fights,
uh, at Bangla Stadium and Patong Stadium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Won all three by two by knockout one by
TKO.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Moved out there when I was 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like an awesome adventure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, like back then, I mean, now I look
back at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, damn, that's like sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like back then it was just like,
you're just going you're young.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I started fighting and I was
like doing Muay Thai and I was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, if I want to do this, I should just,
you know, do this in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my trainer had been to Thailand and he
was like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was just like, boom,
three months later, I'm on a plane by
[SPEAKER_06]: myself on the, on the way to Thailand at
19 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, pretty, pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all grew up watching kickboxer with
Jean-Claude Van Damme.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fucking jump up, do splits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then Thailand, you know, and I haven't
been to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to going to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some Thailand trips in the
very new future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a lot of friends that spend lots
of time in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends that are living there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis scene is popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends from greenhouse are there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, uh, yeah, those guys are the man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like literally watching them back in the
day on strain hunters and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, like, and then going like even when
we're when I was in Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_06]: going, going to their club, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, amazing, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, they're like my international
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those guys, they're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've, you know, I've been able to hang
out with them all over and they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, and, and now that they're in
Thailand, they're thriving over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're setting up new shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a state of the art facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that, you know, it's crazy about
Thailand is like when I was there,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, this is 19, it's 2009,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: When I got out there, one of the girls at
the gym that worked in the office,
[SPEAKER_06]: she was like, oh yeah, smoke, blah,
blah, blah, smoke for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: She brought me some weed or what she
thought was weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was weed, but it was just try.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'm not smoking that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fucking brown sticks, stems,
rock seeds and like red string string
[SPEAKER_06]: around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would like tie it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But dude, I was like, I'm not smoking
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to give me a fucking
headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will give you a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super strong though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I, I could imagine, but I was
like, ah, I can't, so now to see what it
[SPEAKER_06]: is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also like she was like, we have to
like smoke this indoors and like my
[SPEAKER_06]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like we get caught smoking outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, they'll fucking kill us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, now to see what it is
now, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause aren't they trying to retract some
of those laws right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how far they'll get with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends that are over there that have
their, their feet on the ground or like
[SPEAKER_01]: not afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they might try to change some
stuff around, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always in that we'll see, you know,
especially with our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we're cowboys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wild wild west.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many things throughout my life have
been kind of counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was scared of blurples, the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, nah, auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, they're trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I'm just like, we'll see that
we'll see mindset.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you can't be married to
anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the advances that we've made are just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, genetics wise too, I think there's
a lot of room for advancements in
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the market needs something
new, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you're looking, if you're talking
about like, you know, the world as a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: right now, or at least America,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's lemon cherries, a lot of world,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And runs and lemon cherries run the same,
same, same, same, same, but different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but different, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go to Thailand, you'll hear that
a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, same, same, but different,
same, same, but different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But definitely needing something new,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's like why we dedicate,
you know, you grow, you do all this like,
[SPEAKER_06]: pheno hunting is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only know if you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people think, oh yeah, pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just grow these out and you pop them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, if you, first of all,
you got to grow them out multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to actually try them because
anybody who's just going out and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not trying and they're like, that's the
winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how pheno hunting works.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people out there doing
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, we'll see where they go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way that we do our pheno hunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll pop, you know, we were doing 500 a
month.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we're doing about 200 a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh very, because like those are all lights
that could be flowering, flowering
[SPEAKER_06]: products, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: To go into these jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need as a culture to continue to do
that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like to continue to find the new thing or
else we will be smoking lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_06]: gelato forever and doing, you know,
the same thing over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, we're not in that
kind of society.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like this short-term memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it's like, we want the next best
thing right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we need instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want it different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, that's, that's not,
I don't want what I had yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want something new.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and the uninformed smoker without,
with an uninformed pallet is getting
[SPEAKER_06]: something new every day, but it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem with rugs and lemon
cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's named all these other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though some of it is different,
it's not different enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even genetically different.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this stuff is inbreeding,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So where these people are like,
I made this new cross and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: all you did was inbreed some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you crossed runs with lemon cherry
gelato.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I, I see that so often and I see,
you know, this new flower or this new
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, and it's just a derivative of
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, but that's what I love about
like 11 coffins and coffin candy,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when I tried them for the first
time, I'm like, Whoa, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are different.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're unique and they're, they are
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they fit the market, but they're unique
enough to where people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to stand back a little bit and
go, Whoa, where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: They both have a lot of depth too,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like the coffin candy is like,
you're getting so many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it hits, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that is probably our strongest
hitting flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we've had tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tests really high too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like we use Encore labs and ever like
the cool thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you know, like recently there was
like a California shut down a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: testing labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was funny because I saw a lot of
brands, all of their THC percentages drop
[SPEAKER_06]: from, you know, 35% across the board to
22, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ours stayed the exact same place the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, yeah, it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like even I'll send it to like some of my
other buddies that have brands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, damn, like we got 39 point
something THC the other day, 40% total
[SPEAKER_06]: plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I sent it to my buddies like,
yeah, we've paid for test results too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, no, no, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, this is legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a handful of things that do
test that high, you know, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: anomalies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of them, especially,
especially 40% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that's a rare test to like 3%
plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anything 3% and above is really
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some fives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of 7%, which is mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people don't even understand what
that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: 7% is like, that's like extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're smoking extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, we definitely try to bring something
different to the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's going into our jars and it's
something that we Fino hunted,
[SPEAKER_06]: like we've QC'd it heavily.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Freddie has selected it and you
know, I think he has one of the best
[SPEAKER_06]: pallets in the world, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he smokes so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He should have a good pallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is like, and you don't just
develop a pallet by, I mean, most people
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't gifted with a pallet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like fighting and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be a gifted fighter,
but it's putting in the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's putting in the reps, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, like 10,000 hours,
you have to smoke a lot of herb to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: a really good pallet and to differentiate
this from this, from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people are like, oh yeah,
they go buy the brands or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like really it comes down to the
different flavors and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I always try to tell people
like, especially in the rec market,
[SPEAKER_06]: like trying to train budtenders,
trying to train people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like THC percentages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, you guys need to start
steering the clients away from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can give them a 95% THC
distillate cart, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's your high going to be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very flat high.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you get a, you take a 22% THC
flower with 3% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're going to be fucking through
the roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: 14% sour diesel will wipe off most of
these strains that are testing in their
[SPEAKER_01]: 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real good sour diesel growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff was strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get like the couch lock from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people are
misinformed about what cannabinoids do and
[SPEAKER_01]: they need full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people aren't breeding for
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I've been talking about on
my show how I'm really trying to go back
[SPEAKER_01]: towards breeding for effect, but it's also
so subjective to the individual because
[SPEAKER_01]: people get different effects from
different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, some people love
sativa, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have sativa, I'm probably going to
have a heart attack, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke some super silver and it's a big
old joint of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so it is hard to do that,
but I think that cannabis should be
[SPEAKER_06]: marketed for their effects, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much THC percentage, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: More of the effects of how this flower
makes you feel, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would do good for the,
the rec market, especially to get that
[SPEAKER_06]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at least standardizing some of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's great for brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can start standardizing,
oh, these are our citrus, citrus
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, or these are like the
chocolate, or these are the, the candies.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the hazes, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, if you can go with
effect or at least terpenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like perpene profiles, flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that we're not putting
enough emphasis on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that we could do a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, that's one thing I'm currently
working on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we're probably so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have a completely proprietary
menu, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So proprietary to our brand, having
strains of Wefino hunted, selected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, for the rec market,
I want to have, you know, one or two of
[SPEAKER_06]: each, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I want, I'm trying to find a OG that is
the real OG, like, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look no further.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look no further.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the real, you're ready for the
real OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it in tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, I want the, I'm not sharing it
with a lot of people, but I'll share it
[SPEAKER_01]: with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the OG that when you open the bag,
it burns your nose hairs, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the sweet OG, not the earthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that is how you grow it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it performs better under CMH than it
does under LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's part of the reason,
like a lot of guys are growing OG and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not getting the results they're
looking for, or growing sour diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been disappointed with almost
everybody's sour diesel, except this guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave, who came through with the real,
real, you're telling me about that the
[SPEAKER_06]: other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta, I gotta see this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's just super special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way here, you have a beautiful
facility, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we tried to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it's so important these
days, whether it's a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, your facility speaks for who you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always believe in let my
product do the talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to tell people how great I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that just became that that's ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you show people what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You show people how good your flower is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your flower does the talking, your seeds,
your genetics, when they buy it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they know they're going to get good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't need to market it as
heavily when you can present somebody with
[SPEAKER_01]: a good product that wins every time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like let the flower do the talking,
let, you know, let your flower shine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, dude, you're, you're gonna,
you're gonna develop lifelong clients as
[SPEAKER_06]: long as you're putting your best foot
forward in, in that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I feel like the guys with the
good flower, everybody kind of knows each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one step of separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not that big of a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That side of it is very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's interconnected because not
everybody needs good flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in, and obviously with the California
market, you look at both the flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: the dispensaries, it's all, you know,
at the max, most of it's A grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this special class of
flower that fetches a higher dollar amount
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're seeing, you know,
over $3,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even a hundred dollar ACE.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's that tip of the iceberg,
which is like the NorCal Nemo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The $1,800 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's so good for all of us
though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love the fact that they have $1,800
ounces or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: 7,200 for two pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard from those guys alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post Malone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I heard the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good for all of us though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people that hate on it and they're
like, dude, that's so stupid, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a price point for every
person's budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only good for everybody when
people are getting those kinds of numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, cultivators are getting
beat up these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's never before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, definitely there's cultivators getting
beat up left and right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing is it's like, you know,
at the end of the day, they need
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivators, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They need us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you can't just, but you know,
it's how hard are you working?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going out, getting new clients,
doing these things, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you don't have clients and
you have, you know, a thousand lights and
[SPEAKER_06]: you have bills coming every month and
you're sitting on five boxes and this
[SPEAKER_06]: guy's like, well, I'll take everything for
700 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're like, done, just take it,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then now every time he comes back,
he's going to want that fucking price.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to say, no, I'll just go
to the facility down the street or I'll go
[SPEAKER_06]: to Hadalanta.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go here.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, you know, getting,
you know, me as a cultivator and brand
[SPEAKER_06]: owner, I try to go out and network as much
as possible, go to every event,
[SPEAKER_06]: do all these things, you know,
because like, you know, you could have
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever size facility you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only 10% is probably making it into your
jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you could have a, you know,
just to be honest, because a lot of things
[SPEAKER_06]: don't meet QC or this, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You also can't just put everything in a
jars and have it sitting in a distro,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you're running a brand,
you need to keep the flower fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to play off the market,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you can cherry pick the best,
the best for your jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and not a lot of people are doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously the better brands are,
but there's a lot of people that just put
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't grade it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put the smalls in there or the one
that bothers me the most is these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: with pre-rolls and the pre-rolls are just
the scraps or they're just, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: even just the smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have respect for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That put smalls in, I think that's a great
place for your smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put Skittles smalls in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes just like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them to burn.
Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guys that put shit in their
pre-rolls and then put them out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care how cheap it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, and, and when we talk about it,
it speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that is you then, like that's your
representation of your brand and your name
[SPEAKER_01]: to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would never want to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been R&Ding joints for about six
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe seven months, and we're going to be
doing R&D for another six or seven months
[SPEAKER_01]: with our cultivation partners before we
release pre-rolls out on the rec market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, we're not going to,
unless it's absolutely perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and the thing is, is like,
it's gotta be the perfect flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you want the burn, you want the drip
and you want, if somebody's paying premium
[SPEAKER_01]: price, it needs to check all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, a hundred percent white ash,
oil ring, smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoked down to the roach tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put anything in joint that
doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is stuff that that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't do that, but I would never
put that in a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: True.
True.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we've been, so currently we're
only doing our jars, our eighth jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been trying to, so we have a really
good pre-roll, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't call it pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we roll them, give them away at
events.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like really just like the best
marketing you can, you, we can have giving
[SPEAKER_06]: them away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy and you know, they're going
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting hand rolls to market cost of goods
is insane though.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to all the rollers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like, that's like a whole new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough thing, you know, and it's
like, I think you got to do it in houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: My philosophy now is like, so I've been
working on how can we do this at scale
[SPEAKER_01]: with our cultivation partners to where I
can go in and teach these guys how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do it ourselves basically and put it on
the market and have a consistent quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, there's so many details to
get something that's super consistent like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like as little things as the grind.
[SPEAKER_06]: The right grinder, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you use the wrong grinder and dude,
they've done a lot of tests lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, like the proper doing
skies, they did like a bunch of tests on
[SPEAKER_06]: like grinders.
[SPEAKER_06]: 95% of them or some shit had like metal
shavings in it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I think flour mill definitely
popped on there, but they've corrected
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a big flour mill fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my sweet leaf that I've had since
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one of the first 10 prototypes of
sweet leaf grinders in 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted by my buddy Gus and it was in
97.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still have it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went through some crazy adventures and
then got, I had a spray ground backpack
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had instead of Miller Highlife,
it said Highlife on it, but it was that
[SPEAKER_01]: same design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was in there, got robbed in
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, and they took my backpack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Left in the car?
[SPEAKER_06]: Left in the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't leave anything in your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was the second time in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that grinder went through all this
stuff with me and that happened I think in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was one of the original grinders
before there was no grinders.
[SPEAKER_01]: People used to use scissors and a lot of
times it'd be a shot glass and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: chop it up with the shot glass and there's
some fiskers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to use the hand breakdown technique
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds just too sticky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day too, but back then
everyone was like, we're smoking swishers,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, you don't want a fine,
fine grind when you're rolling a blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're okay with coarse with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But rolling a joint, you need super fine
grind, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like medium grind with,
cause I roll big, you know, two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: gram joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my- Big dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the best flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you do them thin and long with
two and a half grams, that's like anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: from two to three, you can get amazing
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like from R and D-ing, from spending
the time, putting the reps in,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my joint of choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they burn the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're cool if you do them thin
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I was doing these really thick ones
where they get too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do them thin enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them to have, and the white ash
actually, I used to think that was a joke,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the white ash actually keeps the
cherry cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most people don't know that,
but that's why you want that white ash and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why you don't want to tap your ash
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you don't ash it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people will fucking kill you for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and then the oil ring is
just kind of a sign that the joint was,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it was, it was growing correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of resin in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessary for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked some amazing stuff that
doesn't have an oil ring.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also depends on your papers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally depends on your papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you use some bullshit papers like-
And how tight you roll the joint and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many things to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like, there's people who are like,
one of my buddies have like, dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: this batch isn't burning like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, really here, roll up the badge,
smoke it, send him a picture, drip in all
[SPEAKER_06]: white.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, what'd you smoke it out of?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like a backwood and like,
stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're smoking on a backwood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I quit smoking tobacco for the
most part, a long, not a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe four or five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's, there's nothing else around,
I'll smoke, I'll smoke some blunts or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, or some spliffs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got put on a spliffs when I was in
Barcelona with a hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you try it, you're like,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: My heart and Freddy was like, dude,
try it, try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, and one of our buddies,
I was from Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, no, this is like,
this is how we smoke out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, it's actually fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clean, it's smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clean, it's smooth as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you a different kind of high
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you get this clear, clean high
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the nicotine, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I do like- I think their tobacco is
different out there though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's for sure different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on who it is and how they're
rolling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, also the hash is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing a lot of the Moroccan
style.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it was out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All it was was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, and the Tangy, a lot of people don't
like Tangy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangy hash is so popular there and it
comes out so good and it looks so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it a lot better in the hash form
than I do in the flower form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although Tangy had its day and it was
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of linear, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a short like Sacramento,
I don't know like who bred that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was DNA.
[SPEAKER_06]: DNA with Crockett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crockett, Crockett.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're out of sack, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, he's, yeah, he's the Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a Valley guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was on the coast and he was in the
Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's had like a short hay day period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the most awarded strain of all time
at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the two, all the high time
skinner's cups, it was like back to back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was an Emerald Cup a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people, it was also one of those ones
that were like, if you were a judge,
[SPEAKER_01]: you knew which one was the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangy, it was like the one that stood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people, there are three Tangy
entries because everyone's trying to win.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so DNA was getting up on the stage,
you know, and I saw them get up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: stage and yeah, multiple, multiple times
per cup, they were crushing because people
[SPEAKER_01]: were growing their genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are my boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, they do a great job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, they killed it with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, that was like, well,
I feel like that because it was like Blue
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream was popping back then for probably a
couple of years before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then when the Tangy dropped, it was like
orange chirps.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then- When there was like the lemon
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the good side of the,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Agent Orange and most of that,
that was from Seed, that was from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a very linear orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, you were getting plain
orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no complexity to it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, eh, but then I tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: House of cultivar in Washington had a
Agent Orange that was complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very different than like Tangy and
all these other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Agent Orange that I remember was
like orangey, but chemmy too, like almost
[SPEAKER_06]: chemically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how the one was a House of
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a better one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that I had tried, they were
probably from Seed because they sold seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was very linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got this chemmy gassy kind of-
Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Agent Orange I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like lemon tree, I really liked lemon
tree, but there was a lot of lemon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was two different Finos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like the real short Fino that
was super like lip smacking lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grew it right, it had that lip
smacking, like burn your nose a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bag when you open it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Be Real was fucking, he was repping it
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was talking about- Oh, they were,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Him and Burner too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going hard with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 2017, 18-ish, and it was just
popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that kind of evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the Jelonade and the Melonade,
and I love Melonade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Melonade is like- I love Jelonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't get good Jelonade until about
four, three years ago maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to bring you some good Jelonade.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bring you some of our Jelonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Jelonade I had had before,
I was like, oh, Jelonade's not that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Melonade way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had a cut of the Melonade,
and it was like cantaloupes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, when Skittles grown
right, every once in a while, it'll pop
[SPEAKER_01]: cantaloupe turps, where you open the bag,
it's fresh melons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that Melonade used to pop those same
cantaloupe smell when you'd smoke it all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd got bad batches of Jelonade,
and all of a sudden, someone brought me
[SPEAKER_01]: some connected Jelonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smokes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Jelonade is one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Favorite to grow, because it's just such a
pretty plant, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super resinous, perfect bud structure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably 2018, 19 when I first,
no, I think 2019 when I first got that
[SPEAKER_06]: cut, doing monocrops, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because back then, you could do monocrop
rooms where people would just buy 40,
[SPEAKER_06]: 50, 100 at a time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into COVID, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll take everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll take everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the prices shot up during COVID,
and then people started expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem is people got so
excited about the money that was coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were growing good flour,
the prices were high, and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting up towards $3.35 even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For not even the best of the best,
but for really good stuff if you got
[SPEAKER_01]: something different, right?
Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, if you had anything decent with good
color, didn't even have to smoke,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro, you're getting $3,000 a pound during
COVID.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all these guys have stacked some
cash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, ice cream cakes for 3K.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's so wild now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like wedding cake even.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't even give ice cream cake away
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wedding cake, ice cream cake have had
their day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the right scenario, I like ice cream
cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the extract from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the extract is really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the second person I've heard say
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the second person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never seen it or experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it better than the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave me some ice cream cake flour
right now, I'd be like, oh, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you give me a jar of ice cream cake
extract, I'd be like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Purple Punch is one that I won't smoke
the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It bothers me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It bothers me that people would even still
grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had its heyday, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people still talk about it like it
was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: People that don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When if you grew it and you were a girl
that didn't smoke, you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells so good on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It yields like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resonance, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So resonance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you go to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worse of a letdown than Oreos.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least Oreos has some sort of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my choice of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreos is just kind of very flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we call it cardboard turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whereas Purple Punch is just
missing the turps, you light it up and you
[SPEAKER_01]: might get one almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it smells crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you're smoking a big joint of it,
there's no taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like just weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And dude, that's what's so important about
having someone that can select for your
[SPEAKER_06]: brand or being able to select for your
brand, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a lot of this stuff looks amazing,
smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oreos, same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks amazing, smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You smoke it, nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a team that can grow good weed and
also select good weed, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, very important right now,
especially as the country develops,
[SPEAKER_06]: as more states come online, as weed is
more accessible for everybody,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to be developing pallets,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And looking to California, because
California is the melting pot for the
[SPEAKER_06]: world of weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a big international microscope
looking right at California.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing next?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the next thing popping?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the West Coast, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, it's four or five guys that
they're looking at, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That are the tastemakers for the whole
world, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, having someone like that,
having people to be tastemakers for your
[SPEAKER_06]: brand, for California, for everybody
really, it's super important right now,
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out Freddie Biggs.
[SPEAKER_06]: My guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't make them like they
used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and there are some kids that I'm
excited about some of these younger kids
[SPEAKER_01]: getting excited about the industry,
getting excited about rolling big joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I was younger, the guys
that were into Rosin or before Rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like PHO, but they would have
$20,000 rigs and they're 19 years old
[SPEAKER_01]: living with their parents.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That excites me about the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those guys are passionate about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working hard to get those $20,000
pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these kids, their parents live in
like a $200,000 house and they got a
[SPEAKER_01]: $20,000 rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's 10% of your equity of your
home.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, no, it's it's super exciting for
me as a brand and for us as a brand to
[SPEAKER_06]: like see people getting into it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That passion drives the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to drive the industry
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we can take it to the next
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, 100%, 100% with, you know,
even all the stuff people are doing with
[SPEAKER_06]: merch now, like with all these brands,
it's like getting like, dude, Backpack
[SPEAKER_06]: Boys doing like drop stuff, sells out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they sold like $300,000 worth of
merch like they're when they open their
[SPEAKER_06]: Long Beach store.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: One day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they just opened up in San
Francisco, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they're killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like you see what that breeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the next generation of kids coming
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, look at cookies like,
bro, people are like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: originally these do weed brand clothing
brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's like, bro, you can't go
anywhere without seeing a cookie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five year old kids wearing cookie shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew they were like big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had this in the mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like when you see five year old kids,
they might not even know what cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we all know what it means because
it's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's a lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're launching our lifestyle brand,
which is Loud Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our lifestyle brand moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super excited about being able to
offer that to the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel like that's an important
component.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everything circles back to
genetics, but that's a great way to get
[SPEAKER_01]: your name out is by having a lifestyle
brand that has clothing, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: T-shirts, hats, hoodies, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a representation of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can't skimp on the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what other people for sure they
drop the ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, I want to buy gilding
shirts for my lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like I might do gilding
shirts for my genetic stuff where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them out as freebies or,
you know, people get excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we're going to take it to the
next level with Loud Time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to do working like we do
sweaters, shirts, stuff like that right
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I haven't sold a single one of those
printed hundreds, probably thousands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like I said, it's like rolling the
joints, having hand rolled joints,
[SPEAKER_06]: giving them away.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just good for marketing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are working on a merch line as
well, which we should be dropping.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like, like you said, high
quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like all custom made.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to do a high quality if it's like
a real lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, what kind of lifestyle are you
representing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people want, you know, if there's like
goes back to like the economy,
[SPEAKER_06]: like if they're spending money on it,
they want it to be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to throw it in the washer
and dryer and then, oh, it's faded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know, they get five washes out of
the screen printing is fading after
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking, you know, like you said,
five washes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, but, you know, it all takes
time and it's exciting to see other brands
[SPEAKER_06]: do it because it makes it all achievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see other people doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can have a super dope weed brand and
have a super dope merch line that probably
[SPEAKER_06]: makes more than the weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, like cookies for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're crushing it on the clothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: The numbers I've heard have been like they
do like, you know, 50 million,
[SPEAKER_06]: 60 million in clothing sales a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like and that's not taxed by 280.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winners, partners and cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys, they're doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're fulfillment warehouse and
they have so many, so many products,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing they've taken to that
level because they made it possible for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of us to potentially go in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of dope products and a lot
of innovation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're always doing something like
duffel bags, like not even just like
[SPEAKER_06]: smellproof duffel bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have like sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backpacks, duffel bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sick stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you name it, they've got it in
their lineup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Planta, you guys have a great
logo because I feel like it's super
[SPEAKER_01]: brandable and it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with our James Loud,
it's like we thought long and hard we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do something that reps the brand
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Planta, you guys, it's that
luxury brand look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Planta.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you guys are from L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was born in L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, you know, have been growing downtown L
.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: in the thick of it, you know, dealt with
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you talk to anyone that grows in
downtown L.A., all these areas,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like we've dealt with the robberies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've dealt with extortion.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've dealt with all these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like growing in L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: really like from 100 lights to building up
to, you know, 500 lights in L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: in the thick of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like that helped mold our brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like tremendously.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really wanted the logo to speak for L
.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, you know, kind of where we went
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Planta.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like in a world of fancy Mylar's
and die cut bags, like we just want to
[SPEAKER_06]: have a clean cut jar and even the name
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: The product matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing that's really going
to sell it over, you know, a long period
[SPEAKER_06]: of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not here for a short time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're playing the long game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, I don't have an exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not going to happen so fast,
but it is the long game that you know for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like years fly by.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy how fast years fly by.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a lot of people like, oh,
we're going to build this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're selling three years, four years,
five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, dude, there's no exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I going to do after that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I just want to grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Continue to perfect my craft and like
pursue perfection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like every batch should be better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every every jar should get QC'd better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like your experience as a smoker of planta
will get better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_06]: More flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that's what excites me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is just continuing to pursue perfection
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like that's what our brand speaks to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the simplicity of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When so many guys are trying to use crazy
die cut bags.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole other lane too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally, but then so is all the
turped weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turf flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, but so those, the guys that put
the top shelf flower, they turp it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then put it into crazy Mylar bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a huge fan of the turp concept
because I feel like, uh, I like breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: good flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as a breeder, I have so much
respect for guys that can do the
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's where breeding happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that selection process that really
makes one company or one person stand out
[SPEAKER_01]: from the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you, bro, if someone's smoking turped
weed and hands that to me, I'm not smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, don't give me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to eat healthy, like live healthy,
eat clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you want to smoke a vape pen in the
form of a joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the same time we're talking
about popcorn lung and all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are potentially there that we
don't, we don't know, we don't know enough
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tests, the tests aren't, the results
aren't back yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we don't know how this truly affects
us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's really popular in some places,
which is New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you hear like, do you hear like,
but it is a new market, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they don't have the pallets that we
have in California or the understanding I
[SPEAKER_06]: feel like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, and I feel like,
you know, it might be different because
[SPEAKER_01]: they smoke them through blunts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're smoking a blunt and it passes
through, people get excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as like a healthy product,
is it a healthy product?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unlikely that it's a healthy product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's just, it doesn't taste good
to me either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I like real flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was so blown away the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone told me that it was turped flour
and it didn't even taste turped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of like, Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It freaked me out a little bit,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was that, it was that good to
where it was like, Whoa, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like, there's some vanilla
in there and it's in small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they can do all kinds of stuff,
but also most people aren't going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that with the other people's best
intentions in mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's like a gimmick product,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it'll like snowballs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like with a THC powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that's just wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and then it was like the TCA
powder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then a lot of them are doing like the 50
50 blends of THCA CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like way cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, you know, there's always going
to be the revolutions of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll start here and be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then as the market drops, as the market
drops, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: But those products are like, they're
gimmicks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like shooting stars, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They shine real bright and then fizzle
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like moon rocks back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all these things, it's like
they're here for a, for a small time and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll, well, and they'll catch a little
bit of, and the guy who hits it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, if you're on that, you're
probably going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're the innovator in that,
those guys are getting like $5,000 a pound
[SPEAKER_06]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and they have to keep changing the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use the same flour from here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so funny cause it's white runs,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're using white runs as the flour,
at least to my knowledge, they probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was the was a while back that I heard
this, but white runs is the flour and they
[SPEAKER_01]: had to come out with different flavors
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wouldn't get knocked off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big thing on the like East coast
and all these new markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like the bags, it's like you come
out, come out, and then now they're
[SPEAKER_06]: getting knocked off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then now China is blowing out,
you know, 10 million of these bags and now
[SPEAKER_06]: it's in every, every store in downtown LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, they're staying ahead of the
curve.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, dude, shout out to like
the die cut guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everyone has their own lane,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I just think that, you know,
a lot of those lanes are going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: short-lived.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the best thing to do in this
market right now is put out super good
[SPEAKER_06]: flour and make sure that is the focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're going to do die cut,
have a product that backs up the amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: die cut bag that it goes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get a lot of respect,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dudes are doing it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to spend the money on the flour
or I'm going to grow the most amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to put it in the most
amazing Mylar die cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid $3 for this fricking bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then, then you get respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that goes a long ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the guys who were like, I can just
put mediocre flour in this amazing looking
[SPEAKER_01]: bag and then try to pass it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That and just making sure like all like
spend all the money on the die cut bag,
[SPEAKER_06]: have the strain for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then keep that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see guys that are like, oh,
this week it's this, next week it's that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but same flour, just different bag.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that's what I can't get behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we've been talking about
consistency, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all comes down to consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, don't put different
flour in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure your QA, QC game is on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important across the board with
everything that you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: For like the people that are going to be
around in five, 10 years, they know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are, you know, that's what I'm
striving to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're trying to play the long game.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we try to QC everything, make sure
everything's as good or better than stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: that you, I would smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, like I'm not going to put anything
in my jar that I wouldn't personally
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or give to my friends and family to smoke
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people, a lot of brands are
just like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're, we have so much of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just throw it all in the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where they lose over,
over the long run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, they're just chasing that
immediate money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think that's part of the
problem in the United States with the
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality is this instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of it stems from the,
the internet and from the accessibility
[SPEAKER_01]: of, we have accessibility to anything and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you look at the mindset over in
some of these Asian countries,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, where it's like gradual improvement,
Kaizen, you know, it's like gradual
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharpening the sword every day.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even have TVs up right now in our
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just moved six weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still haven't put the TVs up,
which is actually a blessing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never would have thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took TV out of my room too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, cause that shit will
keep you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll keep you up cause you'll just get
locked into some show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're like, wow, fuck it's 3 AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can now it's not like before where
you had to watch it once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you want to mainline that show
and watch it back to back to back with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch them all in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spend 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so that goes back to the
instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to move slowly,
move away from that as a society and
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize that it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we can, I mean, I think awareness
is the biggest thing with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, once we can be aware of where the
problems stem from, we can fix them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until then we're going to have,
uh, you know, the latest greatest thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's genetics, which I think
eventually it's going to stabilize where
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like, I want 11 coffins for
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: From you guys, or I want coffin candy
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your staple, your flagship
strains, and maybe you try other stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they'll have genetics from a company
and those are their genetics that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we have interstate commerce,
they'll be able to go to any state in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States, hopefully, and be able to
pick up a jar of plant to 11 coffins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be the same as if they
went to another state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get excited about that part of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that is one thing that I hope and
look forward to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like with interstate commerce,
you know, we're talking about federal
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization and it's like, is that going
to be good or bad?
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at the government and what
they've done, or at least our state
[SPEAKER_06]: governments with cannabis and taxation,
taxation, they've kind of dropped the
[SPEAKER_06]: ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we have to assume it was
probably, you know, things don't change.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just evolve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure it's probably the same,
same blueprint that happened with alcohol
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They bring it in and then as, as it
becomes more normalized, hopefully the
[SPEAKER_06]: taxation becomes less and less and we get
taxed like a normal business or a normal
[SPEAKER_06]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But until then, like, I'm not too hopeful
that when they do the first rollout,
[SPEAKER_06]: when that happens, or if that happens,
I could probably say they're not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and there's going to be problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are growing pains that every
industry goes through in the beginning or
[SPEAKER_01]: almost every industry goes through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you're involving something
that can be taxed so heavily and the
[SPEAKER_01]: government, they want their tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncle Sam's your silent partner and they
want every, every step of the way they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to tax it in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait for the day when they,
I mean, I think there's politicians
[SPEAKER_01]: involved that are invested in cannabis
companies, but once they recognize that,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, these guys have to make money,
but there's a huge consolidation phase
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going on right now where companies
are going out of business because
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are getting absorbed.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colorado already went through their
consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's I think three or four
companies that own 90% of the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and California is much different
than that, but we're slowly but surely
[SPEAKER_01]: going through that same consolidation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've seen, you know, currently right
now we're building a Planta headquarters
[SPEAKER_06]: in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be Grow, Distro, sales
offices, you know, just our HQ,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And before that I was, I was looking to
buy a Grow right in LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's new grows on the market every
single day, just going out of business,
[SPEAKER_06]: going out of business, and they're just
getting eaten up, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like pennies on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pennies on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty sick in a lot of cases where I
feel so bad for the person that invested
[SPEAKER_01]: that time and energy and that amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably even more to fail,
even more than the money is your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can't ever get that back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time and just like, I don't know,
like the feeling of failure, like doing
[SPEAKER_06]: all of that and then having, you know,
things out of your control for the main
[SPEAKER_06]: part, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, a lot of the, like unless
you're growing top, top tier weed and
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it very efficiently, you're not
going to survive, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of these taxes, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would these grows that went under have
survived if we were taxed like a normal
[SPEAKER_06]: commodity?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, yes, they definitely could
have been on their game more, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But people thought it was the green rush,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They just think, oh, we'll do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to hire a master grower that,
you know, red flag, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever hear someone call themselves a
master grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the biggest red flag out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if it's on your resume,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as your resume is master grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just, that's a huge red
flag.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's a, it's a sad state of
affairs right now in like the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry for cultivators.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the only thing we can do is
really try to put out top tier flower and
[SPEAKER_06]: hold your ground, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like know your worth and put out good
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how you'll survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think the other thing is,
is a lot of people forget the biggest part
[SPEAKER_01]: is the distribution chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go with a thousand lights
and you've never grown before and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: no distribution chain, you're going to
burn through your money so quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution is one of the most important
components of having a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you get your product out to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the end consumers buying your
product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to do a website?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like try to, how are you going to
market yourselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: But also just that distribution network is
so huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like even as a cultivator,
but also like on like my consulting side,
[SPEAKER_06]: like people, you know, a lot of people
offer me consulting gigs, trying to do
[SPEAKER_06]: this, trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, all right, that's like one
of the main things I look at, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, okay, am I going to be able to
collect from you, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be able to sell all this
product, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I could grow the best, you know,
buyer and, you know, high grams per per
[SPEAKER_06]: kilowatt or high grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be able to sell it and
you're going to be able to pay me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people lack that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of that green rush era where
people thought, oh, we're just going to
[SPEAKER_06]: invest in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get all these suits coming in and
we're going to have 10,000 lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have this, that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, where would you,
you don't even know anyone in the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you going to sell it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at a certain point, it doesn't
matter how good the product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's lemon cherry gelato and you,
you're, you have a thousand lighter and
[SPEAKER_01]: every three months you're pushing out 2000
pounds of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to struggle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, even if it's the best lemon
cherry gelato in the world, developing
[SPEAKER_01]: those relationships takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that trust, but verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I live by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, people always tell you
whatever, you know, but then it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's easy to go around and, you know,
another thing with the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like growers, for instance,
if you're hiring a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to find out who they work for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a small community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, yeah, it's a very small
community and the people, especially,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you touched on this earlier,
like the people that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like even if I don't personally know them,
I can reach out to any of these big brands
[SPEAKER_06]: and be like, Hey, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, do you know this person blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because they know I'm reputable too,
they're going to reach out, hop on a phone
[SPEAKER_06]: call, tell me everything I want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That I need to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, that's one of the good things
about the industry is that it is very
[SPEAKER_06]: easy, good and bad actually, that it's
very easy to get in touch with people now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day it didn't used to be,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we didn't even use our real names.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, and now it's like,
everybody's on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Oh yeah, I used to work for
this big company and I ran 4,000 lights in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's pretty easy to track that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you used to grow good flower
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, they either did or they
didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that is kind of subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't know what good
flower is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of people like,
I've seen a lot of packs like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there has to be, to be able to
get the top dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everybody grew just as good as you did,
you wouldn't be able to fix the price that
[SPEAKER_01]: you get.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also in this market, like every,
there's a, there's a place for every grade
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis on the shelf, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everyone is trying to buy a hundred
dollar rate, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody can afford to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people want to, or are just okay
with all they want is to get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want that a hundred dollar ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but those people will also,
every once in a while, want to buy a $60.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like you said, they want the hundred,
dude, I heard like a lot of the retailers
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked to, they'll be like, Oh dude,
this is, I'm like, does this stuff even
[SPEAKER_06]: sound like, dude, people sound like ounces
of shake.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our number one seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the dollar or two dollar joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it blows my mind that those are so
popular.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people don't have a power.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like, yeah, it's, it's a budget
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also most people don't have a
developed power or even know what good
[SPEAKER_06]: weed is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like they're okay with just smoking
that because that's what they're used to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Budweiser does so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's consistently shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are okay because the price
point is so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, what would that one piece
[SPEAKER_01]: be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go harder, take more risks earlier on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm older now, I, you know,
have family, all these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, it's harder to take risks now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything has to be calculated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not just thinking for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my thing would just be double down on
your strengths.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go harder, take more risks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without risks, there's no reward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, do that while you're young,
you know, because you can start over at
[SPEAKER_06]: any age in life.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of people didn't really
get going until their mid thirties and
[SPEAKER_06]: then, you know, or mid forties,
mid forties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you hear the stories all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's okay to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's okay to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fortune favors the brave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I, so when I used to do really
dumb shit or, you know, do stuff that I
[SPEAKER_01]: probably wouldn't do or even want to talk
about on this show, it's a crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always say that fortune favors the
brave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take risks.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even, even when it was stuff
that I was scared of just in life.
[SPEAKER_06]: These people go down in history and like
make huge names.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, look appropriate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Kennedys, they made all their
money from bootlegging.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: From doing illegal things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, take risks, calculated
risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calculated risks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be afraid to fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like, dude, failure has taught me
more about life than anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like when you win, it's short-lived,
you know, when you fail that shit sits
[SPEAKER_06]: with you and sits with you and then you
dwell on it and you're like, all right,
[SPEAKER_06]: how do I not do that again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really get good lessons from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And compared to, you know, you get,
you get a win and you started stacking
[SPEAKER_06]: wins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a lot of people reflect on their life
when they're losing and not when they're
[SPEAKER_06]: winning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're winning, they're riding that
wave.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're high.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's also good to like reflect on that
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reflect on your wins and like,
okay, how am I riding this wave?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, like I said, just try to
keep a calculated risks and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: don't be afraid to fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when times are good, reflect on that
time too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, you know, look at how you're,
why you're winning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're treating everyone good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting good karma.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing all the right things.
[SPEAKER_06]: When no one's looking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cause karma believes whether you
believe in karma or not, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, uh, karma is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes both ways, good and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do good stuff, when you do bad
stuff, everything comes full circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Comes full circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a firm believer in karma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like always, always try to do the things
right the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even when no one's around,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when it really matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, do doing everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: With integrity is a big thing for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like that has helped my success
a lot.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Integrity is so huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think long-term integrity and work
ethic goes just such a long ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Integrity, work ethic, discipline,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes down to discipline,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you want to lose weight,
you got to be disciplined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't just fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's not immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not instinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The instant gratification is a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you might, when you're young,
it comes off real quick, but as you get
[SPEAKER_01]: older, you know, it's like, you got to be
disciplined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when you don't want to go to the
gym, those are the days you need to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the gym the most.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you don't want to do the
things, that's when you should force
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself to do them more than any other
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like people like motivation,
this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, I like fuck motivation,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're not going to be motivated to
go to the gym every day, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be motivated to get in
a fucking cold plunge every morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be motivated to go to
work every day, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You could put on any fucking YouTube
video, all that shit, but like that shit
[SPEAKER_06]: fades, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you need to be disciplined,
like fuck the motivation, be disciplined
[SPEAKER_06]: and like show up every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how you really make shit
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up for yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's never too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing people don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's never too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never too late to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a firm believer in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, it goes a long way, you know,
it goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people want to know more about
Planta, where's the best place to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Instagram, Planta underscore CA,
that is our only account.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many fake pages, scam pages.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Planta dot underscore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's like the newest one,
but there's so many fake pages.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our real page is at Planta.
[SPEAKER_06]: Underscore CA our website,
PlantaCannabisCo.com, which we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: actually be launching statewide or
actually half statewide with our partner,
[SPEAKER_06]: MJ direct for the first.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be San Diego to San Luis Obispo
overnight delivery.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should be launching in about two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll be through our website,
PlantaCannabisCo.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after a few more months,
we'll be going statewide as well with
[SPEAKER_06]: direct delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Direct delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to go these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like especially getting fresh
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's what excites me about
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is fresh product because I
think that's where we lack the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it doesn't matter how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it sits on the shelf for six months and
somebody buys it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happened with an eighth of backpack
boys that was actually, I paid $75 or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever and they've been on the shelf for
way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't realize it got home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got other ones that were just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like buying Requiem just to see
what's going on with stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on with these brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Flora Flame, it's like,
I'm good friends with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get flour from Chris sometimes,
you know, but like, I do like going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary to actually pick it up,
see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And freshness is so key.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just did a store takeover on Cookies
and Melrose this past weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I'm always buying competitor
flour, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see what they have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I feel like it's very important
to keep your finger on the pulse as a
[SPEAKER_06]: brand owner, as a cultivator, all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I can go to any of these,
my buddies that own brands and like,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're always, they're always giving me
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But seeing it in the store, seeing what
that final product is, is always going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be different than what your buddy who owns
a brand gives to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're getting the freshest of the
fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my friends are always giving me the
freshest of the fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm getting these
[SPEAKER_01]: bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even fully cured out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I'll smoke it now and I'll know
that in two weeks, it's going to be even
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also seeing what's on the market and
seeing what, how stuff, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: also rosin is another one I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to, you know, I have one of these
little dippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen these,
but these are electric dabbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it because I can just taste all
these different samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I can sit there and I don't
have to take big dabs anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I do like dabs every once in a
while, this is just easy and convenient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try 20 different things and I
don't have time to heat that rig up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, dude, you see these, like it's a
full kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you got your rig, you got your
torch, you got your fucking temp
[SPEAKER_06]: regulator, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the, like the,
the Puffco's and the Eris and the Focus
[SPEAKER_01]: the Focus V and you know, all these
different, you know, all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: brands, Dr. Dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love that where you have the control
of the temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're digital.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a consistent hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing to see where that industry is
going, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's mind blowing how they got here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I feel like curling irons.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like in seeing the innovation on that
end is sick too, because like you look at
[SPEAKER_06]: just the rigs that have come out and like,
they're getting more consistent to almost
[SPEAKER_06]: like a real dab, like from a rig,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like that's what everyone
struggled with in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now like the technology is catching
up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an Eris somewhere over there,
but yeah, that's, that's my new favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like not a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's not a rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere in between and it gives me
a great hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's temperature controlled and it's
consistent and it's not a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a pen hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a dab hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a rig, but it's digitally controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pocket size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can put it in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can throw some rosin in there and I can
go to a music festival or a concert and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause not, you can't have joints
at every place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could, I would, but it's not always
the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, those, they're, they're pretty sure,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy was just, uh, in order of glob
mops.
[SPEAKER_06]: He, uh, we went, we were in Europe and he,
this fool was hitting dabs in the Paris
[SPEAKER_06]: airport in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, bro, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: But those rigs make that possible,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, different, different age,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, and we had,
it's gone through these crazy different
[SPEAKER_01]: iterations from the time we had these big,
huge, you know, it was like Hitman and
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica glass back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, even before that,
they were like these monster rigs that you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to have huge cases for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were smoking on titanium for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: The nails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glowing hot, glowing hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the least favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really only stick to flower now because
I was scarred from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, yeah, like 2015 just red hot,
the hotter, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are putting snakes on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dropping these one grand snakes
in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do, why do people pass out from doing
dabs?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, bro, they were doing a 900
degree dab and fucking suffocated
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves with it, with hot smoke in
their throat and passed out and went into
[SPEAKER_01]: convulsions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen many of that that happened at
many of sessions back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen people pass out and I've
seen people not be able to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, I dabbed him out one time and he
couldn't talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went comatose on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it BHO or what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, we were making, we were whipping
butter back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a wax or a butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but in a Pyrex dish with BHO,
open blasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a double burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm like, well, we're using PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, there's no way this is
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy came back a few years ago with
the COA and he's like, I told you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no residual butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero.
Zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I guess that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: PVC, you know, it's like, still not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we went through learning
and growing pains and to get us to where
[SPEAKER_01]: we are today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like without people open blasting and
doing all that sketchy shit, getting blown
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some friends that have gotten blown
up and have, you know, they're scarred for
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without that, like the Holy Water
crew, big shout out to Holy Water,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys really changed the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changed the game with the Terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, making real sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like, everybody knows,
you know, the extracts and the sauces,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like they made stuff that was 30%
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tasted mind blowing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first hit it, I was like,
I knew from the first hit that they had
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out something that was going to
revolutionize extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, those guys are the man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually did a collab with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: For some of their pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we supplied the flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: They supplied the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were killing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, they changed the game
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that innovation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, without innovation, you know,
we're going to be stagnant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, whether it be from open
blasting BHO to, you know, new tech with
[SPEAKER_06]: Raw's in or everything, it's just like
watching how the game evolves is always,
[SPEAKER_06]: always, you know, good for the community,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I mean, for me, it's motivating
to try to keep my hand on the pulse and to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to push it forward, whether it's with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have all these different angles
because, you know, I'm not popping 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're popping more seeds than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more seeds than I'm popping.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not breeding it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have the easy job.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got to grow it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, 200 seeds a month is wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you put nine, because I do nine
plants per light, so I can take a photo of
[SPEAKER_01]: each plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to take a photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see, I don't top them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what the structure looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a lot of costs that you don't
see the return on for a significant amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do see the return, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've had many runs where there's not
a single keeper, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very picky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I throw away a lot of things that
most people would probably keep as their
[SPEAKER_06]: keeper, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll still hold on to some of those things
where everybody else is like, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, let's just have the
terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't really ever look at yield
for any, like that's like the lowest thing
[SPEAKER_06]: on the checkbox, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: With me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, keep some stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that was an option, but now when
you're running so many, it's like there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a limited space for storage, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had keepers that my cultivation
managers have lost, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also seeded out, you know,
because we'll run them, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is like the shit that doesn't get
talked about, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everyone sees like the fire strains
and like the winds, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But no one sees the losses, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, I pop them, grow them out,
take cuts off each plant, run them,
[SPEAKER_06]: keep those cuts, then select from,
you know, a hundred, 200 of whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: however many we run of that cultivar we
select, then I rerun them again,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of a hundred seeds, we'll probably
pick five, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Freddy will pick five and then I'll rerun
those five and then he'll select down and
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll do it until you know, if we need to
run it three times until he selects the
[SPEAKER_06]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the genetics change from one run to
the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you're dialing the genetics in,
they can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't do the seed run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get rid of the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to make clones of it and I
plan on licensing or growing those clones
[SPEAKER_01]: out, that seed start goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause what's the point of growing it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see something you'll never get
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just save yourself a hundred days,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It always changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the ones I think are the best,
the next time they're not the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other ones where I'm like,
no, man, there's no way that that's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just get rid of that from seed and
do the first clonal generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least starting there, you're saving
yourself a hundred days, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to grow it from clone in the
future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: True.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then once we, so once we select it,
you know, we rerun it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I've had where my managers
mislabeled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then a male was in the room, seated a
whole 50 light room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seated a whole 50 light room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recently, you know, within like the last
year, like to most cultivations,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's probably detrimental.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that might be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be, we're shutting the doors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Still have those seeds though.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm about to make some fucking heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's never going to live that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that those are the growing pains of
like trying to which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see people like chucking pollen in their
facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right when I see- Well, that's why
you have a nursery, a breeding facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a place where you're phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was a little bit of
cross-contamination, it wouldn't affect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we have going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I'm not producing any flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't produce flour in the facility for
sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to minimize, you know,
there is pollen mitigation, SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not contaminating if at all
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 10 separate environments that we
can create.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reversals in, we can leave males in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a beautiful facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have it dialed in for breeding for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it just, as I've gotten older,
I really like looked at what am I focused
[SPEAKER_01]: on and what do all the other things bring
me so that they can take me back to my
[SPEAKER_01]: focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we got a breeding book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my breeding book and that's just a
resume, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it also is like,
okay, all this stuff I've learned,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I forget it, I can go back in my
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also taught me how to log data
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use software programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an amazing software program where
we can take 50 different points,
[SPEAKER_01]: over 50 points per cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure wet and dry weight,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like data is super important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're, especially in cultivation,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in my, I'm not honest, but like we
take so many data points every single day,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like people, you know, some growers
take data to try to like, I've heard of
[SPEAKER_06]: guys being like, oh, I'm going to create
an AI system and I have this exact,
[SPEAKER_06]: these data points.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know exactly how to steer it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, dude, this is a living thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will never fucking work, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will never work.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, it won't.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a living thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every run, even if it's, you know,
biscotti, I run the same room,
[SPEAKER_06]: same everything 10 times in a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like these clones are going to come in
with more vigorous roots than the last run
[SPEAKER_06]: and this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like everything needs to be steered
differently, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But taking data points, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, if I know in like day 10 to 21,
I should be growing two inches vertically
[SPEAKER_06]: a day or 1.5 to two inches vertically a
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have my guys taking vertical
measurements every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at day 13, we dropped from two inches
a day to 0.5.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, okay, now we need to look
top-down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And start dissecting where the problem is
at, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where most people that aren't doing that
are going to get to day 21 and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: missed their target height by,
you know, eight inches, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It affects your yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to affect yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to affect a lot of things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, your bud size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then there's, so like there's,
there's ways to mitigate those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have them, I mean, there's plan
B, but still.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always plan B.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can prevent it, it's the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preventative is always the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's IPM, you know, it's properly
looking at, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a closed facility, but we still
have plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we still have IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you have to, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: People, people look at IPM as like they're
fixing problems, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, everything needs to be
preventative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're doing IPM two to three a week,
just maintenance, no bugs, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sprays two, two times a week and
one drench.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, up until day 21.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That SOP keeps even, dude, no bugs,
but we're still spraying every week,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you'll never have bugs if you do
it properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, if we, if you do get
run into a problem, then you have an SOP
[SPEAKER_06]: for that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people are just only using
IPM or doing this for, to try to,
[SPEAKER_06]: when they have a problem, you're already
too late.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we take the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I have a full data sheet,
you know, whether it be stock measurement,
[SPEAKER_06]: height measurement, bud measurement every
day, you know, EC water content,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also, you know, through the room is,
you know, is there any leaks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is there anything, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because these facilities are out to get
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing, nothing is meant to run how we
run these facilities, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're running ACs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dude, ACs are just at max capacity.
[SPEAKER_06]: DEHU's are at max capacity running 24
seven, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, these facilities are out to
get you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So having people who are tuned in and
making sure that they're like consciously
[SPEAKER_06]: going through these data points,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you don't want guys that just come
in and clock in to just do their work and
[SPEAKER_06]: then check out, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Get their check, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You need people who are dedicated,
who have a vested interest in like growing
[SPEAKER_06]: fire weed, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I take the data,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And to show them on paper, like,
you know, when we switched this irrigation
[SPEAKER_06]: strategy and this environment strategy,
you see what it does to the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like instantly we can, I can make them
grow, stop, you know, within the first
[SPEAKER_06]: like 21 days, you know, we can control the
height pretty, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we have fixed lights,
you know, we're like, Oh, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you have the, you know,
the up and down?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, if you can steer plants really
well and you're on schedule and you're
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure your plants are coming in at
your target height, you won't really have
[SPEAKER_06]: those issues, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a very dialed facility though.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I feel about the data and what
it's good for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing trials with them right now on
seed production because I want to push
[SPEAKER_01]: over 50,000 seeds per four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like under canopy horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing both the under canopy with the
favins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do the horizon light lift,
bring the PPFD way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to use both and see,
okay, side by side, what kind of results
[SPEAKER_01]: are we getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we pushing those boundaries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the beauty of this
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can R and D everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can trial this A versus B and we can do
that a million times over to really
[SPEAKER_01]: empower our customers at the end of the
day for getting better results.
[SPEAKER_06]: With every piece of equipment,
there's a good practice for it,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as like commercial and doing,
you know, seed production, amazing,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be able to get the light
control as much as possible, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with seeds too, because like,
you know, it's not going to grow like a
[SPEAKER_06]: clone, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then seed production, it's like,
most people have white seeds on the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's not enough penetration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, the favins I think are going
to be a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we don't know yet, but I'm going to,
my educated guess is that we are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get better quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even in the seed game, it's
different than the flower, but it's still,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all about having the best quality
product and the better, more even seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: you have, the more money you can get for
your seeds, the easier it is to sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like good flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like with increased, like PPFD
lighting, under canopy, all of that,
[SPEAKER_06]: like it's all very linear, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like more light has always equaled more
weight, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would assume that transfers over into
seed, seed production as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're doing the two benches at the
Oakland facility right now that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: trialing some under canopies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it could definitely be,
be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've yet to see the results like
in person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone says they're amazing,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm a very show me person,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a lot with a little, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like really good irrigation strategy and
environment strategy and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: proper defaults and all that, like will
produce a lot of weed, high quality weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the like favon or under canopies,
I think if you have the electricity,
[SPEAKER_01]: not everybody has electricity for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the power, I think they're a
great investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just the yield, because you will
get better yield, but also the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're running LEDs and you want
more color, you have more color on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom than you want on the top now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I see it as a benefit even from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, regardless of yield,
yield is great, but let's look for a
[SPEAKER_01]: better product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quality, quality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's like, I feel like a lot of
people have gotten away from that,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like when all these big facilities
came on, you have all these people just
[SPEAKER_06]: like, how many pounds, how many pounds
like, can you grow this, this,
[SPEAKER_06]: this, and this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, there's definitely a
tipping point of like getting high yields
[SPEAKER_06]: and quality, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you can blast 1500 PPFD and
push four, 4.5 EC at the dripper and get
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy, crazy yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like not, not even large, like fucking
big.
[SPEAKER_06]: But can you sell big monster buds too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if they're purple on the
outside and green on the inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was going to say is that
like, it's a point of diminishing returns,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like, you know, pushing it
properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Connected was running under
canopies for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the faving guys actually came from
there, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were running like the purple
spectrums at Connected, like the blur
[SPEAKER_06]: pulls, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always wonder, cause like,
in my opinion, you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: plants only uptake light from the top of
the lights, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I used to think.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, so here, here's my thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you remember like back in the day,
Connected also had like a bunch of like,
[SPEAKER_06]: when they were using those, like some of
their, like the biscotti seed,
[SPEAKER_06]: I wondered if that was from, you know,
they took care of the problem for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And started, you know, but I was wondering
if that was from the under canopies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I was hesitant to use them,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is because I would think, you know,
sometimes it might work on 85% of the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, but you know, that one finicky
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That finicky strain, which biscotti is
very finicky, like does not like light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you give it too much PPFD in the
early flower, you're getting super foxtail
[SPEAKER_06]: buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just does not like light like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, I always wondered like,
does that stress the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm excited to see where like our
trials with them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then dialing in over time,
if you see good results, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ever evolving, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing is ever evolving from
every angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool to see too, that like all of the
under canopies being made right now are
[SPEAKER_06]: from real cultivators too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The innovation is coming from real guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: From real guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's like, you see, you see like
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's doing it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got everybody jumping on board.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, a lot of the big guys,
you know, Favin, I know Craft Farmer has
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mango has them.
[SPEAKER_06]: All like real farmers that are like,
I can get behind that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's, I think that's good for the
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, like back in the day,
you'd see like these, like people come out
[SPEAKER_06]: with AC come ACs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this AC does this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, they're not, anytime I've
had like grow equipment made by someone
[SPEAKER_06]: that wasn't a grower, like some AC company
that tries to design something,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's always the fucking worst.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always the worst shit ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over-complicated, you know, they had,
you know, no one can work on it yet that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they don't have enough service
tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a lot of products all the time
from people that want me to show their
[SPEAKER_01]: product on the show or get them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen everything, anything and
everything, as far as different things in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry from irrigation systems,
irrigation methods, to new forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmers, new forms of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are just like, Whoa,
like you trying to reinvent something that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't need to be reinvented.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that happens in every
industry though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you're looking for
innovation, it will happen, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff is just going to be derivatives
that aren't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get somebody who's popping
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, you know, that lemon cherry
gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All from a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do the skin sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get a tour of the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a farm tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to videotape it and share it with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about, our Oakland facility is about
20 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So easy game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
