[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, my special guest is Heston Alcorn
from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Heston?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he actually invited himself on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great because you are a home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said you wanted to be on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, let me look at this
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're super passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had really any home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the majority of people
that watch my show are home growers or
[SPEAKER_02]: very passionate people about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you're super passionate
just from looking at your page and talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been around it for a while and trying
to find my place in the cannabis scene
[SPEAKER_01]: these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of leaning towards the
educational realm and home growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: very big population of home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, every year there's new states
coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of home growers in the
country grows every day, every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have much more access to
information than we did when we first
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 90s, I was afraid to go to the
local library to look at botany books
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're afraid the sheriff's
department would come in and check the
[SPEAKER_01]: card catalog or something silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now with the amount of information out
there and people have access to it all,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of unfiltered avalanche.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people make these big purchases and
uneducated decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I took a shot to,
we moved our family out to Oregon to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the OLCC commercial production and
got our license in just before the
[SPEAKER_01]: moratorium got caught up in that whole
nonsense for a year and a half or so we
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up having to sell our farm and kind
of gave up back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Oklahoma originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took a couple of trips back and
toward the idea of moving back and
[SPEAKER_01]: partnering in on a couple of grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon is way better for cultivation than
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that was talking about Wild West.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's finally starting to settle down a
bit out there, but it was kind of chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you know, got family,
wife and kids and kind of happy in my
[SPEAKER_01]: situation and finding that people are
hungry for information and want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a big crowd of people
that are really passionate as well about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like you said, I appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel very strongly and have very
opinionated sometimes about certain
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of the of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, I think I just
want to share my my passion and be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: let someone that's never grown a plant
before have that experience of taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, harvesting it and then having a
really nice product that they did
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very satisfying experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and it's an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are those are great life
experiences to see something that starts
[SPEAKER_02]: as a seed and then finishes as a usable
product that you can use to make smoke or
[SPEAKER_02]: there's other uses as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can put it in an edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do so many different things with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely very versatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can juice it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make ropes with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like the sky is the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just a really amazing
thing that slowly but surely as we get
[SPEAKER_02]: more technology, we start losing these
things like butchery is a dying art,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see real butchers very often
like you used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every town used to have a butcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every place had had actual butchers that
would break down cattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of, you know, I mean,
I would say that all grocery stores,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the most part, are just not all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the majority of them have have actual
just packaged meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cows go into one end of a
building and packages come out the other
[SPEAKER_01]: and into a truck and shipped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butchers cut out of that process now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people used to grow their own
vegetables or grow some of their own
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now most people, I would say more than
90 percent just buy produce from the
[SPEAKER_02]: grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I think there's some real enjoyment
that you can get and you can learn a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: about nature and you can learn a lot about
failing and learning from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are important, valuable life
lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get so many different things
about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like the the physical,
the reward of being in the garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving your body, interacting with plants,
learning from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, you know, in the age of social
media pretend like they're perfect and
[SPEAKER_01]: only put their best face online and,
you know, assume that they don't make the
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like they've made those mistakes
for years and years and learn from them to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to get to the point to show you
these pretty pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's also it's very important
to acknowledge your mistakes and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be humble and learn from your
mistakes and be honest about be honest
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be honest yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you don't get good at
something without making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not how life works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think you can be naturally
gifted and have a natural green thumb and
[SPEAKER_02]: get good results right from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can also be someone who's
passionate, but stubborn and they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: give up and learn how to be a really good
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're passionate about it
just because you don't get it right the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time, that doesn't mean you
shouldn't try and try and try again until
[SPEAKER_02]: you get it perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see you see you see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, people, you know,
spend a couple grand on a tent and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: for sale in six months because they bombed
their first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you put that thing in your
notebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you do wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how do you build on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just one and done and quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And give up, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see what happens a lot of times is,
you know, people, they get into it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, they want to build a six
lighter right out the gate and then spend
[SPEAKER_02]: all this money and invest all this energy
into something they don't really know
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best thing they could have done is
probably just got one light and put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: a room or in a closet and experimented
with one or two or five plants instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: putting the room with 36 plants,
because it's so much different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these scale, as far as people don't
think of 36 plants as a big scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: but compared to one plant or two plant,
it's significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exponentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exponentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes, you know, for each one of
those plants to properly care for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and there's automated watering
and there's some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I think people should learn how
to water by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would never do large scale by
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been a big proponent of automatic
watering at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that there's anything
wrong with waking up in the morning and
[SPEAKER_02]: going watering your plants in your
backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really gotten enjoyment over over the
period of my life from the plants where
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watered, you know, right when the
sun's coming up, I'll go hit my plants
[SPEAKER_02]: with water or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like there's a lot to be
learned from that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, it's like the more
you're interacting with your plants on a
[SPEAKER_01]: daily basis, you're going to catch issues
before they become problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you've got your automatic
watering and you pop into the tent once a
[SPEAKER_01]: week to check the reservoir where you
could have spider mites that were in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, the last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're well established and a
problem instead of being in there every
[SPEAKER_01]: day and seeing some pest damage or pest
pressure and being able to react
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think being able to recognize
problems early is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also one of the beauties of automated
watering that a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: realize is that it allows you to spend
more time with your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find those problems before they
become issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been become a huge fan of the
automated watering, at least in partial
[SPEAKER_01]: replacement of hand watering, because
just, you know, in my my my four by eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having issues with pH fluctuations
because I was getting dry pockets and just
[SPEAKER_01]: the volume of soil, you know, going from
20 or 30 gallon bags to four hundred and
[SPEAKER_01]: thirty gallons of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that that change was enough to throw
a wrench in the system and then adding the
[SPEAKER_01]: automated water to keep the the soil
moisture more consistent level changed,
[SPEAKER_01]: changed overnight, you know, improved
things overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about how you
grow, because I feel like that's an
[SPEAKER_02]: important part of the story, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do no till living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's taken me a long time to get to
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I make we started just kind of
shotgun planting seeds back in the river
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms in the late 90s in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, guerrilla style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go out and plant them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of 20 plants would survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like going from that hands off to now,
every day, hands on and being involved as
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of ran through the nutrients I
did, you know, you know, start off in
[SPEAKER_01]: Miracle Grow and Botanic Care Emerald
Harvest and ran through the gambit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that kind of started getting into
the organic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked some organic flour, you know,
years ago and kind of did a side by side
[SPEAKER_01]: and was really intrigued by just the
process and then kind of started down that
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's led me to the no till and trying
to be close the loop as much as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: in my personal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that led to some modern natural farming
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And composting is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My little bug friends are do a bunch of
the work and really trying to dive into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil biology and just the life that
exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under that multi-layer is where all the
magic happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really, really enjoy the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, get that kind of the mad
scientist in the lab with all the ferments
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're doing a lot of the inputs,
making that stuff yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another something that's very rewarding is
that you're, you know, you're hand
[SPEAKER_01]: crafting a lot of your inputs yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another level of satisfaction
that you're coming back to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I enjoy the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, you know, takes a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the thing that people come
at me with, you know, the organic soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, hydrosoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to argue against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, but it's, you know, apples and
oranges situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very apples and oranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it has, it's a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of people that want
to have, you know, this black and white,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, definitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do it this way or you're,
you know, doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, there's a thousand
different ways to grow and none of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are wrong or incorrect or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are tools that can be
applied in certain situations that they
[SPEAKER_01]: work best in the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if you're depending on what
your goals, your personal experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: preference are, is going to kind of lead
you and draw you more towards one style of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got a buddy that's a
plumber and he's not ever going to quit
[SPEAKER_01]: growing hydroponically because he's a
plumber and he loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he gets going tinker and build
manifolds and do the pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, that's his,
that's his deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many different things on
every level, whether it's lighting or
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics and it's all subjective to
personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what people don't
understand is it's all subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, best is just like what the best
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like saying a Picasso is better than
a Monet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really the sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you start talking about organic
living soil, like no till living soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even just soil as opposed to cocoa,
as opposed to, you know, rock wall or
[SPEAKER_02]: different substrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when you start diving into that,
then you start looking at things like
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one big thing that stands out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most for no till living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can get pretty good flavor out
of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ash white, good flavor, oil ring,
all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great commercial product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as you start getting into some of
the boutique stuff, the thing that stands
[SPEAKER_02]: out the most is the effect of living soil
smoke, where I feel like it has the best
[SPEAKER_02]: effect for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go side by side comparisons,
which I've done many times, I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect on the living soil,
it has a better effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you like smoking a lot and you like
the effect of it, that's important.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even without the higher THC numbers a
lot of the times, I don't hit the high
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers in my living soil that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like all of the other
cannabinoids that are coming into play are
[SPEAKER_01]: balancing that out and making it that full
spectrum effect in the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of numbers are you hitting
roughly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mid 20s, you know, low to mid 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: With just water, you know, not pushing
anything, not doing too much supplemental
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had a nitrogen deficiency,
not because there was a lack of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when the woody mulch starts
to break down, bacteria tie up the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to feed some fish amino acids and
fish hydroxylate off and on to bump the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen up to acceptable levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once the mulch breaks down and starts
cycling properly, it's basically water
[SPEAKER_01]: only.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can add the beneficials and do
compost teas, worm teas, and add stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's another conversation about
diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, you have this living
soil, this, you know, 430 gallons of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like a self-contained ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really all the work that you've done
for the last few months, six months,
[SPEAKER_01]: a year, jump-starting that to life is so
you can step back and really let it do its
[SPEAKER_01]: own thing and only have to add water and
make sure that soil moisture stays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in an appropriate range, so the
nutrient cycle, and then it's all up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, you know, and that's the,
that's going to be kind of the heart of
[SPEAKER_01]: the class I'm putting together here on,
I hate to say it, we call it a master
[SPEAKER_01]: class, no-till master class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically geared towards people
who want to transition away from synthet
[SPEAKER_01]: or bottle feeding, even bottle feeding
organics, but transition from that to a
[SPEAKER_01]: more no-till, hands-off approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't give master grow certificates
out at your master class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not, I was not a fan of the name,
but that's what we're going with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The master class I'm okay with,
but I feel like the master grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just such a generic thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, seeing it on resumes when I was
going through those processes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you know, it just tells a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who told you you were a master grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, who gave you that certificate?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's one of those interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's walk through your process for
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do tests?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you send your soil out for testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a microscope?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing tests?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as far as identifying issues like
nitrogen deficiency, how are you doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I build, you know, mix my own soil and
send in for soil tests after every
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So see if I need to catch up on anything,
add dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I don't have a scope yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of playing with that,
the microbiology scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of companies that offer
testing kits as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what bacterial fungal levels your soil is
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you test in one zone, multiple
zones?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you- Yeah, multiple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my four by eight bed, I'll take six
samples, basically six different samples
[SPEAKER_01]: at all about the same depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, you know, a six inch core sample
taking the entire core and two pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil tested out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty good average.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it gets a pretty good
cross-section of everything in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, since I mixed it
myself, I know it's pretty, pretty even
[SPEAKER_01]: mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to have too many hotspots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I add amendments, it's very
consistent and evenly spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there shouldn't be, you know,
hotspot pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you build your soil from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people use build a soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people use vital as a starting point,
you know, and then build on top of those
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I started Coots Mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was my kind of 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that you should just
dive right into it and make your own
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tried and true recipes that are
great for your first bed, build a small
[SPEAKER_01]: bed, use someone else's recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to reinvent the wheel right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in your situation, you can decide
after a harvest or two, like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I'm going to bump this, add this,
change this more aeration, more compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then start making those decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people come in and be like,
well, I'm going to add six extra cups of
[SPEAKER_01]: blood meal, bump the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, you got horrible pH
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't, you know, nitrogen,
you know, clod plants in the first two
[SPEAKER_01]: runs because you just, the soil is too
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are definitely lots of,
there's lots of room to play and adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: and make your own recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just like with anything else,
you, you don't just assume that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to understand soil biology better
than the people that have been doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for 30 years and come in and totally do it
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're not set in stone and you
know, the Coots Mix has got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: controversy last few years, but it was a
good starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that it was kind of the first
soil recipe that people could just grab
[SPEAKER_01]: off the internet and then kind of start on
their own doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before it was a lot of trial and
error, a lot of people mixing their own
[SPEAKER_01]: batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then doing like eight or 10 batches
next to each other and trying to decide
[SPEAKER_01]: what worked better in their environment
and situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do, and that's like, yeah,
mixing the soil source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to source local inputs as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have good inputs, you're up in
Lincoln City.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a nice pick in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the, the coast is right there so I
can harvest, you know, seaweed and do the
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp, bull kelp, oyster shells and
seawater for minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the forest is bountiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvesting as well for lots of ferments
and inputs, horse tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just filled up a barrel of horse
tail for silica for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nettles, blackberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got a nice spread to,
to forage through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the blackberries are popping this time
of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out of control and it's,
they're an invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as many as you can cut back,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've heard this time of
year, especially it's great for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for ferments or putrification for JDM
because you have all different aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got fresh growth, immature flowers and
ripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a nice broad spectrum
fertilizer right there growing wildfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year now you guys got to worry
about fire danger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've heard like starting, like you
probably don't on the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as bad, but it is not as bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we moved to, to Lincoln city
seven, coming on eight years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wildfire was not, you know,
we're in the temperate rainforest on the
[SPEAKER_01]: coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to worry about wildfires and
we almost lost our home two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fire we burned the well house and had
some smoke damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our neighbors up the hill,
you know, a few hundred yards away was the
[SPEAKER_01]: fire line basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of our neighbors were not so
lucky, still recovering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely something that
everyone's having to have a conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: about unfortunately now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our fire plan and well,
you were there recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one road in one road out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a great place to have to evacuate
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then even Hawaii,
they had one of the worst in history in
[SPEAKER_02]: our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was wondering about my trip
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a, I don't know when the show
air, but that was tropical storm threats
[SPEAKER_01]: and hurricane possibilities yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So driving from Oregon the other day,
yesterday, there was smoke in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was driving through Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked apocalyptic where you can't get
a bright red sun and you can't see more
[SPEAKER_02]: than like 200, 300 feet, like clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all just worse than LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that the PTSD orange now that
smoky orange tent and you're just in that
[SPEAKER_02]: panic mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recycling air on your car where it's
recirculating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could still smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, it's no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we get into California and it's
torrential downpour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the roads are greasy
because we haven't had any rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you don't want to drive too
fast on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there was flooding in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had an earthquake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty wild, wild times, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about auto flowers because
you won an auto flower cup a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 2021.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, I love having people on
the show talking about auto flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think auto flowers are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so did you grow in soil or tell
us the story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, uh, kind of serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I had got and ordered a pack of
photo period seeds and got a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: packs of auto flowers as freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last time I had grown an auto
flower was back in the, like the lowrider
[SPEAKER_01]: era.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't like super impressed with the
lowrider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated auto flowers back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so times have changed for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a great, great experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had a, you know, nice big
plant, beautiful flower, uh, smoked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was really nice, but it was,
like I said, it was just kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: offhanded, uh, freebie and turned out
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, I just had joined
Instagram at that point in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a come across the auto
flower cup up in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, I was into auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of, you know, trying to find my
entry back into the world of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: thought, you know, auto flowers are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a very, uh, big application,
I think here in the near future,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, they're, they're up and coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could kind of see that then and
wanted to be involved in the community and
[SPEAKER_01]: meet some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I'll enter this cup,
uh, and, and, you know, no expectations
[SPEAKER_01]: really of winning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the first auto flower I had
grown since a low rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, eight years or so,
um, and it entered a couple, two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks before the cup and was excited to go
and meet people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I, I won the, for the flower and
got to meet some just amazing people and
[SPEAKER_01]: had a great experience and been like,
uh, it was kind of my, my welcome back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Washington state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born in Portland, but, uh,
I love Washington state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have good friends, people I consider
family up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was out on the canal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just picturesque, gorgeous setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found some interesting flower at some of
the dispensaries up there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I was looking for the
Yeager.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Yeager flower just to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's a good train.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good variety and very popular in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's popular, more popular in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I was looking,
still looking for the Trinity,
[SPEAKER_02]: my buddy Bob from Eugene, I used to call
him Eugene Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the, he went to cannabis cups and
brought some Trinity one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd had it back in the day and that's a
good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the four way, the Trinity,
the snow and the corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was one other one,
but we got all those, the dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got, we got those from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon's always had good, but yeah,
that's, yeah, it was, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California, Emerald triangle,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best growing conditions in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of the, we were,
we were living out in Rhode Island at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time and talking about where we were going
to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wife finished her residency and I
talked her into Oregon and that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the weather, the climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: She found a job that she liked and kind of
all the stars aligned and the rec market
[SPEAKER_01]: was open at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, I was going to go and grow
for OLCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Lincoln city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely become our home for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chill for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little beach town.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little beach town.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the little, like the hippie side,
which I like tie dye.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a good tie dye shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the people with the tie dye
shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, but yeah, a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's really good food
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice, it's a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a, you know, 20 years ago
because of the mild climate, it was a big
[SPEAKER_01]: draw for retirees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that kind of a whole market kind
of came up around that, but now it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people moving from Portland and
Salem out of the cities down there,
[SPEAKER_01]: brought some, some nice amenities to,
to town where it's usually closed down at
[SPEAKER_01]: seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was like seven o'clock
lights out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's only, well, when we took the
Uber, cause I didn't want, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we have some wine or whatever,
I like wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went, we went to the Bay house at
Salishan.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going there for dinner and I was
going to have some wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't drink and drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my one big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't drink very much anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely don't drink and drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, well, they got Uber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got an Uber.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took like 10 minutes for them to get
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a big deal, but we get in the
Uber and the guy's like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's only two Uber drivers in
the whole Lincoln city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turns out there was actually three because
we got picked up by the third one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was only his second pick up and
drop off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got Uber just brand new to Lincoln
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a year old or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny that the taxi, love you taxi
one on one, if you need a ride sometime,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, the taxi, it would be like an
hour after you called, they'd show up with
[SPEAKER_01]: four other people in the car and be like,
we got to make five stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we drop you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on over when you get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so as far as auto flower advice,
if somebody is going to grow auto flower
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first time, cause I feel like
there's a lot of skeptical people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, auto flower sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I think the auto flower is
special and it's unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's maybe not for everybody,
but like for the people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in growing out a flower
finishes from seed 70 days, 80 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 days, depending on the variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that beauty where it's predictable
on when you're going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: What advice or tips do you have for people
that are interested in getting into auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest thing for auto flowers
is less is more like people want to like
[SPEAKER_01]: drown them and feed them and burn them up
in that first two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first three weeks of an auto
flower is super critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first three weeks,
because if you fuck up in the first three
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, you're not going to get a big plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is the biggest issue that
people have is in that first three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just, they're doing too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand that auto flower is
very light feeder, light drinker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a small root zone compared to a
photo period plant of the same size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think everyone should grow an
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've only grown photos, if like
myself, you know, had a bad experience
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago with an auto flower,
they've come so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone should try it out because
like you say, you plant a seed and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, 80 to 90 days later, it's harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just vegged for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: In my photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a nice turnaround.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that once people start to see
the versatility and the utility and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I have primarily grown from seed the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start my photo period seeds and
I'll start auto flower seeds along with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, two and a half months later,
when my photos are ready to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, the auto flowers are ready to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that, you know, that little
bumper crop in between for a transition
[SPEAKER_01]: where you would otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bumper crop is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you're not, like you said,
if you're not getting pound plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like it's, it's taken up extra space
in the bedroom and you're getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest that you wouldn't have had flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can still get four ounce plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you're getting small plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people don't get four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had friends that I got better yield from
my auto flower plants and they do from
[SPEAKER_02]: their photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, four ounces on a plant
indoor is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And four ounces outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think that's the higher end,
but you know, I've seen some, some plants
[SPEAKER_02]: on the internet where I'm like,
that's gotta be at least 200 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see like close to those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The auto pots, I think is the one,
the biggest ones I've seen the
[SPEAKER_01]: self-watering, the bottom, uh,
sub irrigated planters set up against the
[SPEAKER_01]: big auto flowers and those things for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bigger isn't always better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean it's going to smoke the
same as a smaller plant, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: each to their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So side note, do you think that plant size
affects the, the taste and flavor and
[SPEAKER_01]: quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've kind of been on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think half having smaller buds as
opposed to having monster colas,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, is beneficial, you know, but,
but I also love looking at big,
[SPEAKER_02]: huge colas and arm size colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as like concentration of
cannabinoids and terpenes, I think you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get from smaller colas,
but it's also so specific to the cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and you know, the genetics,
a lot of that has to do with genetics is
[SPEAKER_02]: some plants are meant to be big and some
plants are forced to be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people force them to try to get
them big and you don't get the same
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue dream, sour diesel, those are
naturally just big plants, but like sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel, for instance, it's more airy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to get, you know,
blue dream, the bigger it gets,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it gets pretty dense and you can get
some serious petritis in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whereas sour diesel, I feel like it's
more airy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it lets water in and water out some of
those equatorias.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason they're like that is so that
they can allow humidity in and humidity to
[SPEAKER_02]: escape from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 98, 98% humidity and rains for two
hours every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have some sort of way to
dissipate that moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just have a conversation a
couple of weeks ago about, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 10 pound plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thing of beauty, but I feel like
too, like a pound plant tastes better than
[SPEAKER_01]: that 10 pound plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're the same or whatever it's side
by side, I feel like the plant struggles
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce 10 pounds worth of cannabinoids
where it can focus some more of its energy
[SPEAKER_01]: on a smaller plant and, and be more
efficient in that production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not, but I think even within the
zones of a plant, you can take a bud from
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the plant under strong
concentrated lights, and then you can take
[SPEAKER_02]: a side branch and you could smoke them and
you'll have, even if you smell them,
[SPEAKER_02]: the one on the side is going to smell
stronger typically than the one on the top
[SPEAKER_02]: that's exposed to all the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always the case, but I think a
lot of times like you'll get that
[SPEAKER_02]: difference and it translates into the
smoke too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I a hundred percent the last,
the best smelling bud I had in my last run
[SPEAKER_01]: was like up under the canopy of the shade,
like a little, an airy little golf ball
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see guys smelling the colas on
Instagram, a lot of that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you get the experience guys,
they're going to be selling the side buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: the side colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, and that's just,
you know, that's a personal preference
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, but I noticed you get way more
turps smelling the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think like the proximity to the
light and the intensity and the heat up
[SPEAKER_01]: there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of genetics are you working
with up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I've been, I've been all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of going back to play with some
land race stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like talking about just trying to get
ahead a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, in Oregon,
especially, man, we've, there's a few
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that just got so hyped and played
out so fast and everybody's tired of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not Yeager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a lot of the cookies crosses and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we talked about the funneling
kind of how everything kind of goes
[SPEAKER_02]: towards one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people get so excited and that's all
the hype and they call it exotic,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet that's all everybody has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's the same things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think exotic, I think of that,
like 16 to 18 week flowering plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody has because nobody's running 16
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exotic, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to capture some of the qualities
from those super long flowering plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: cross it back to something that's been
worked better, shorter flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in kind of having the best of both
worlds or at least when you're doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding to a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding may be a stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to educate myself enough to
start down that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're a seed producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a seed producer, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think everybody should do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being a seed guy, I just,
I think everybody should have that
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they understand the difficulties of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, we talk about how to
select for these certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how do you find out what traits
get passed on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And really from experience, from growing
out the progeny, you really see what gets
[SPEAKER_02]: passed on by mother and father,
you know, donor or receiver, however you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to put that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, that's the interesting fun stuff
for me is because you get these recessive
[SPEAKER_02]: traits that sometimes they don't pass on
to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get some gas and you breed it and none
of them have the kind of gas that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm fascinated by the process and love
seeing, like you said, what are you going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's the seed going to do if
there's not much better than popping new
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that, that just the anticipation,
you know, a couple of months and you start
[SPEAKER_01]: to see flowers set and get some aroma
coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're disappointed because it doesn't
have that gas or it's like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is exactly what I was hoping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it looks amazing in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you go to smoke it and you're like,
oh man, it doesn't translate into the
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just such a myriad of
possibilities in that little tiny seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I want to, we're talking about,
it's like, I have a plan, maybe one day in
[SPEAKER_01]: three years, I'll be comfortable to like,
to sell a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have, you know, a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a plan to get to where I want to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, you go online and
everybody's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can throw a rock and hit a
hundred breeders on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call yourself a breeder online,
whatever you want, but like anybody can
[SPEAKER_02]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the phenohunting that is the hard
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Selecting new, you know, phenohunting is
only used in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, we're doing selections for
phenotypical expressions, or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting for genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, is like, that's where
the magic comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to be able to grow the plant
good enough for it to express,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to discern between the
different plant expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking at different
phenotypical expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you grow shitty, they're all going
to look very much the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when you smoke them, they're all
probably going to taste the same and not
[SPEAKER_02]: that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second you start becoming good at
cultivating enough to, that's how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: good at cultivating too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're popping seeds and this one's
like this and this one's like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one, it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or all these are the same and these are
all pretty good, but this one smokes way
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's really, so
cultivation is always the starting point
[SPEAKER_02]: for being a good breeder, for being a
breeder that's making good seeds even.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's another benefit for the
living soil is you're not, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not steering it with your,
you know, your nutrient selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it in this, this healthy
environment and it's going to do its own
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to communicate to the soil,
what it needs, when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to express itself kind of
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it would in a synthetic
nutrients, it's allowed to, to show what
[SPEAKER_01]: it would do in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you see like, you see the
really different expressions in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the organic, in the organic environment
where they're allowed to do their own
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see of the future for Oregon?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've gone all around with
allowing everybody to get a license and
[SPEAKER_02]: then people struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Oregon, we, we, it was two and a half
years ago put in, we got our license right
[SPEAKER_01]: before the moratorium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stopped taking applications for a new
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a 33 acre farm up in Tillamook
County and we're planning on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my sister moved up from Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother moved up from Arkansas and
we're going to do bootstrap it up and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of slow build out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, OLCC made the rules such that
previously it was like your caseworker
[SPEAKER_01]: basically for the OLCC calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, Hey, you ready for a
facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspection would come by, make a list of
things you need to fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me when it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back in two months when you get,
get all the problems resolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shifted from that to your caseworker
calls you, okay, 30 days from now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming for a site inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pass or fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us to have been able to do that,
we would have to build out a facility not
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing if or when we would get inspected
for a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, talking a half a million
dollars invested in a facility out there
[SPEAKER_01]: not knowing if it would be eligible for a
license ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got, we ended up having to sell the
place and it was a year and a half after
[SPEAKER_01]: we put our license application in that
they contacted us to see if we were ready
[SPEAKER_01]: for our inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that point we had moved on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that they, early on with the
big canopies and stuff, they made it very
[SPEAKER_01]: easy for whoever wanted one to have a
license and overproduction kind of changed
[SPEAKER_01]: the direction of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the testing laws and regulation
changes, it seems like they're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure on the smaller farms and the
organic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you saw the Aspergillus
testing that they just implemented within
[SPEAKER_01]: the last couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no, no studies, no data,
no cases to, you know, to, no reason to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement this testing law other than
these companies coming into the state and
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying for the laws to be changed
because, you know, this remediation
[SPEAKER_01]: company comes in and has a solution,
but no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they changed the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now, everybody's failing for
Aspergillus and now what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Aspergillus is pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's never caused an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, there's never been any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not causing any health issues and
has never been documented, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from smoking cannabis causing any health
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because this company came in and
lobbied for the rule to change that,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause they had the solution to the problem
that they created basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, you know, it's,
it's scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just like, and that's kind of
the, the, what I, I've, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when Oklahoma went online,
we're from originally from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had friends and family building out
and I flew back and forth a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: times early on in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that kind of burnt me out
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of stepped back away from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just such a, a rat race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's a cutthroat deal in the
commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I can't speak on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as you probably know personally in
firsthand, but whenever I first started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, it was like this super close knit
group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was very a hush hush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very close knit group of friends
and family that did this illegal thing
[SPEAKER_01]: together because you couldn't talk about
it and post pictures on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like the industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It shifted from the community to the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now understandably so, because it's a
multi-billion dollar business,
[SPEAKER_01]: people aren't friendly to each other on
the commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we need some more of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The passionate people need to stick
together and quit trying to bash each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and troll each other online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's silly because we're in this together
and the more of us that are still here
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like you want to see quality
cannabis, don't get rid of the little
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we should all be joining
forces and not separating.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should, we should get together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting a, I'm trying to start a
non-profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to profit up to hire a lobbyist
on the national level to promote and go to
[SPEAKER_01]: bat for home growers because we have
nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, and you go online and
it's, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media, you go on and everybody just
talks constantly talking bad about other
[SPEAKER_01]: people's grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, like the last three,
four years, I haven't seen a picture of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bad looking bud online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the cameras are so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see every little mite, every little
bit of powdery mildew, all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at pictures, you know,
like people are really aware of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then, you know, they've got filters
for all the cameras too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have that, you have that
everybody's bashing each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, especially like it's,
it's especially absurd in the home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're not competing against each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we should be banding together to
ensure that we have the rights to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: growing at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is kind of where my
energy and focus is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like now moving forward is to provide
a community instead of an industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: provide that community for home growers to
come together and, and it all band
[SPEAKER_01]: together to fight for our rights as home
growers and ensure that we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue doing that in the future.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years ago, everybody's like,
Oh man, that's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing such a great, like kind of
see, you know, sharing information to pat
[SPEAKER_01]: each other on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's just that social media
toxicity where you got to be better than
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone or, you know, whatever ego you
need to stroke to talk bad about someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ego is just, yeah, the ego needs to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a lot of people and they don't even
know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I'm older, I recognize it even
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in my twenties, I had way bigger
of an ego and I thought it was way cooler
[SPEAKER_02]: than I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized I'm not that cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think as you get older, as you start
losing friends, as you start experiencing
[SPEAKER_02]: life more, I mean, I think the years go by
faster for one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you're alive longer, you,
it's more relative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about data points all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living life is the best way to collect
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you're going through life and
the more data points you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more you understand things and living
life and going through life, you really
[SPEAKER_02]: start picking up those experiences and
seeing what's real and what's not real,
[SPEAKER_02]: what really matters and what really
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are you really passionate about
quality or are you really passionate about
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without home growers though,
there's not going to be the same level of
[SPEAKER_02]: quality because I feel like those guys are
the passionate ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the majority of the people that
watch my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, super passionate people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get people that are in the industry
too, but the home growers, like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is so just rejuvenating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like seeing somebody grow for the first
time legally, like there's so much joy and
[SPEAKER_01]: passion coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, I've been doing it for
a while and I lose some of that childlike
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder and it's nice to see somebody so
excited about it and it kind of rekindles
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire in me that there's still people out
there that are doing it for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, this is all new and they
want to, they want to soak up all the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge they can and do it as to the
best of their ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's just fantastic because
you get so cynical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been cut backstabbed a couple of
times on deals and you get, you lose faith
[SPEAKER_01]: in humanity and you just, it's a grind and
you're growing as becomes a chore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to remember, this is like,
this is still new for some people and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still, they're still got that
passion and fire to get out and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: best in the beginning, that passion and
that drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that's one of the reasons
you're on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I saw the passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, you got the real fucking
passion for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it gets overlooked a lot of
the times, but people that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: around it a while can, can appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank you for having me again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's all about the
diversity on the show and being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: see different perspectives and to be able
to capture all this stuff on film and
[SPEAKER_02]: great stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's like, you're in the
industry at this point, but five or 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years, it's going to be great to look back
and see these conversations that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: and see where the industry ended up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not going to be in the
same place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing for sure is it's not going
to be in the same spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, we evolve and we
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter what, the only thing
constant really is change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years, uh, federal legalization and
it's scary and beautiful all at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to see people going to prison
for camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that people belong in prison
for, for a plant, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've come a long ways, but we still
got a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw this coming over 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw legalization happening in my
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea it was going to look like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be sitting here talking to you,
but I knew that it was going to happen in
[SPEAKER_02]: my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still not fully happened though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still not all the way there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not at the finish line.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is he's like,
kind of remember this is like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: an industry that's in infancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just starting up and there's,
there's a lot of directions that could go
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could go back to no legalization and
totally black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could, you know, and then everything in
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I tell people like my,
I'd like to be able to sell 15 pounds a
[SPEAKER_01]: year farmers markets, a couple of zips
online here, legally, illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's where I would like to see
it go and, and be able to have the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love the vertical integration
model and the terroir for the guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about this all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last podcast too, but like terroir with
the outdoor farmers and it's vertically
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to the farm, you can smoke the
weed that they grew there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the right part of the year,
you can watch them harvesting the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: set a bed and breakfast everywhere,
whatever they want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like going back to that
boutique model is, is great too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's another great direction
that the industry should be going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, commercial cultivation,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics on a scale or on a commercial
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with that,
but I also like the boutique aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of micro brews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really drink beer anymore as much,
but I do like the micro brewery model
[SPEAKER_02]: where there's all these micro breweries
all over Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, like there was more micro
breweries there than anywhere else per
[SPEAKER_02]: capita in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I like that analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something that people can
really relate to wrap their heads around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, there's always going
to be the market for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cheap beer that you get a big case for
10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's going to be the $500
bottle of scotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be the market for
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I also look at it from the
perspective of someone that's young,
[SPEAKER_02]: that becomes very passionate about smoking
weed when they're 14, like I was being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to acquire a billion dollar company
or a hundred million dollar, or even a $10
[SPEAKER_02]: million company.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot further away than being able
to open up my own custom, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my own dispensary or my own shop that's
vertically integrated where we grow the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, you know, a mom and pop
type business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are going to keep the
passion alive in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great to be able to see that,
you know, cause I think that's when the
[SPEAKER_02]: passion for a lot of us has started was
when we were young.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me, it was 14, 16 myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: High times magazines back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love, I still have my high times
magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Taliqua, Oklahoma is a town I grew up
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one record shop in town that
they didn't have any explicit lyric albums
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to have an 18 year old come into
the store and order it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super conservative, religious,
small rural town, Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have high times at the gas
station.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not, it was not an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, you go visit your cousin
in Tulsa and they have a high times
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like taboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just seeing it and then kind of joke
around too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a lot of, you know, brick,
like literal brick weed in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody knew somebody or had an older
brother or cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had something that wasn't brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Drill because we associated
hydroponic with hydro is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was good weed, you know, so find some
Drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like 30 bucks a gram or
something, you know, for a nug of Drill,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was worth it at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that, this, that, that mentality,
seeing that bleed over into the Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_01]: medical market, I talked to a couple of
people and tried to, they, they wanted me
[SPEAKER_01]: to come out and help build out a
hydroponic facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, I think you should
really consider like, soil, organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, it was because of that Drill,
you know, that mentality from 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, the Drill was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they wanted it to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they built their hydroponic system out
and six months later, two harvests later,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were tearing it all out and go on
organic living soil just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But kind of the, the holdovers from the,
the before times when it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal and the mentality of people
crossing over into the legal market,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is I think at one point,
anybody could grow and make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now like, you have to have the best
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be successful in this
industry now, you better strive for
[SPEAKER_02]: perfection because all the big companies,
they can grow middle grade, they can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: B plus, A minus, maybe even A grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you grow that A plus, if you're
that 1% or better, and that applies to
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think especially with flour,
and if you want to be a cultivator,
[SPEAKER_02]: you better be a badass cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't, it doesn't, you know,
it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd grow middle of the road stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in some of these emerging markets,
you might get away with it for a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit, but like Montana, you got skunk VA
over in Montana and that dude's crushing
[SPEAKER_02]: some badass flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and you know, all over, there's people
all over that are really good cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before where it used to be,
you know, and the part of the reason it
[SPEAKER_02]: was illegal, but now with legalization and
popularity and awareness, and also we have
[SPEAKER_02]: all these tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, like you said, you know,
15 years ago, you could nasty looking
[SPEAKER_01]: flour still going for a few grand a unit
and then no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It better be pristine, gorgeous,
check all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was outdoor pounds going for a
hundred bucks last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, and how do you make
money as an outdoor farmer?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you used to get a thousand bucks and
now you get a hundred bucks at best,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes with some of these people,
it's like times have changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes for the better, sometimes for
the worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, they're changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anything we can do to stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just try to anticipate what direction
it's going and find a way to being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: pivot, you know, have enough sense in to
make the right business decisions to pivot
[SPEAKER_02]: when necessary and no win in which way to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sticking to your roots, I think is
good too, though, being able to stick to
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots, like what you believe in,
not, not straying away from your beliefs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and that's, that's been huge for
me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the, not trying to to jump to
the next trendy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand people need to play that game
and have to, and they do their own thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and no judgment, but I felt like it was,
you know, even, even though I had like a
[SPEAKER_01]: few hundred people follow me on the social
media and it was like, it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like able to communicate with these
people and talk passionately about organic
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and living soil and how to,
how to kind of close the loop on your own
[SPEAKER_01]: personal garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, very fortunate last
couple of years, I've kind of met some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the right people, made the right
connections, invited myself on awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: shows and trying to, you know,
trying to, trying to, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: find my, find my niche in the emerging
market and got my florofarm.com and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the, the, the living soil class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's kind of, I'm just going
to embrace it and lean into that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the home, home grower education and try to
fight for the home growers place in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, passion is going to
take you a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way it goes and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, more passionate people are about
the better price, the chefs that they love
[SPEAKER_02]: food and everything about food,
the best chefs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but yeah, it's, it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole, the whole evolution of cannabis
and where it's going to go and the home
[SPEAKER_02]: growers and the home growers aren't going
to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, maybe the, the guys
doing it for money are going to go away to
[SPEAKER_02]: a degree, but the people passionate about
growing stuff in their house, just like
[SPEAKER_02]: people making beer in their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that's people still do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, there's a lot of
conversation about, you know, home growers
[SPEAKER_01]: getting pushed out because they,
you know, the, the bigger production
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities don't want that competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to have the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, there are a huge amount
of people that aren't able to grow their
[SPEAKER_01]: own, don't want to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to go to the dispensary and
pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the vast majority of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if everyone that wanted to grow at
their home did, it's not going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: money off the plate in the long run for
these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I don't think there's a need
to demonize the home growers for any
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to make any kind of dent in
anyone's portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's, it's important,
like you said, just for the, the culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the quality and, and sharing those
genetics and the passion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's people are still passionate in
the, in the home growth situation and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're new and exciting and trying to
learn all the new stuff that they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I talked to a gentleman last
week who the last plant he grew was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the early nineties in like
outdoor and the Ozark mountains,
[SPEAKER_01]: like way gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, this is night and day
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like led lights indoors with community
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hated LEDs in the beginning,
but then once they dialed the LEDs in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, big time game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always, I was always a HID lamp some
two years into the LEDs now working with a
[SPEAKER_01]: grand master level up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I have no complaints there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My only issue with them is I keep
underestimating how intense and powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: the LEDs actually are.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so I had to kind of dial it back
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the learning curve with something
new, a new technology is what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yields are definitely bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD and LED are the two big game changers,
I think in the last 12 years that have
[SPEAKER_02]: increased yields significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back to, you know, people that
have a bad experience right off the bat
[SPEAKER_01]: because they treat it like something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm saying with auto flowers,
it's like you come from HPS and you run
[SPEAKER_01]: your room the exact same way you did with
LEDs, HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, of course your results are
going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting the same weight you
were with your HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that the lights are bad or
that the technology is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean you're a bad grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you need to learn something new
and you just need to say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to learn somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a learning curve to stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are so proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that, especially from a
grower, someone growing on scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you have to be very confident in
your ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to feel like you're doing the
right thing and the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also like with that knowledge and
experience comes the knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience to know that you need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can't be afraid to lose or make
mistakes because that's the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't let your ego tell you that
you're going to do it right perfectly
[SPEAKER_02]: every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can take the ego out of most
equations, you're going to do a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solve so many problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not being afraid to fail in business,
in life, in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take risks and believe in yourself and
believe that the next time you do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though you fucked up, you might even
completely fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a failure if you learn something
from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In life, you just really never know what's
what and what things mean and if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: good or bad until the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until everything kind of unfolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindsight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always always easier to see how it is
from a distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been working on these for about
six months using different papers,
[SPEAKER_02]: different tips, different flour grinds,
like the flour mill got me on the
[SPEAKER_02]: different flour grinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grind it thick, you know, real,
real small or you go coarse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somewhere in the middle is what I
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these organic tips, these are
bamboo.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're disposable, but I feel like
they're natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then professional general or
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He helped me with some of these and then
I've been working on them on my own,
[SPEAKER_02]: different papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the raw, but I also like rice
papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're not releasing these on the
market anytime soon, but it is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to be for sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we do our selection process,
every time we get bags of these,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I prefer, I know what the plant looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what the plant smells like,
but what does it taste like to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you want to taste or is
this something you don't like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really interesting doing the
blind selection process or the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenohunting blind where it's like smoke
this, smoke this, smoke this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me some feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying, it's like probably
every person that samples it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: different opinion or a different
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people like the effect really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think a lot of people realize
like they like the effect or the taste or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are just like, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this or I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I like about this size is it
doesn't burn too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 3.5 grams in here, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a big joint, but it doesn't burn
too hot when it's rolled this thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried the wider ones and those just burn
a little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get the full turps, but if you
can provide somebody with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: then they get the best experience
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really at the end of the day,
I want people to have the same experience
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being able to share my flower or stuff
I'm working on with them, I want them to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the same experience so they can judge
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of the same way I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people that are connoisseurs out
there that already roll joints,
[SPEAKER_02]: when they roll it, they're like,
oh shit, that's a good one.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fine looking specimen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they burn pretty even.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get some good stuff with
white ash and the oil ring around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking good, but- What flower is
this, do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the Zerios Skittles Zerbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Candy turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got some Skittles S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did a lot of stuff with Skittles
because I really like the candy turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting seeing what it gets
passed onto like in other things,
[SPEAKER_02]: structure wise, and the structure's
heavily tied to the flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want the stuff that's real
skittly and you cross it to something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's very different, the ones that are
going to taste real skittly are the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to be the most similar to
the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you start making calls early on
based on that structure then if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking for that candy?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because every once in a while you get
like some crazy, like I don't pull,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not pulling stuff that smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it smells like Skittles and it
grows like shit, I'm still going to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: it out because Skittles looks like shit
pretty much when you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not the nicest looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good in the bag or whatever,
but like I think that it's also very
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it might take you a couple of
rounds to actually grow it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you're poppin' seeds,
you should probably grow it out multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not for the sexual maturity factor,
just for the fact that you might have to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn how to grow those specific plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then same thing with phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're going through the first time,
we might have a different one the second
[SPEAKER_02]: time that we think is the best and the
third time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically by the third time, we understand
it and we have our selection and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or those are the three that we really like
the best and we keep those around,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, out of, however many seeds were
popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I have very rarely run
something consecutively or multiple times
[SPEAKER_01]: or enough to become intimately familiar
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, that's the difference of the
growers back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all used to grow the same thing over
and over and over and over 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 runs, 20 runs and might only grow two
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like what you do is you'll grow the
same thing for just a couple of runs and
[SPEAKER_02]: switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I like to, I've been
primarily growing from seed the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years and I just, you know, new,
new seeds every round, starting something
[SPEAKER_01]: new every two months or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's kind of, I forgot,
I was talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, do you call the early ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like something that kind of we're
forced to do as home growers is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't run a thousand plants and keep a
hundred, keep a thousand cuttings back to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hold onto to make, make those
selections after the flower has been
[SPEAKER_01]: processed and smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to like start making some,
some decisions early on and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, am I throwing away some
potential keepers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have the option?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, I got a small, small little
basement grow and a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: confined, confined to the plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get four or six plant count.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, I select for the nose
typically when I'm going through the
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, even the shitty structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my partner, Jason Hutto up in
Seattle, we've done a lot of phenol
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting or selections together.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he definitely has an eye for the way
the plant grows as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the nose first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, but me, I'm all about the nose
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I'll get, and I can be off,
I can be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been wrong before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing, like
translating into from the smell on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to the smoke in the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing might, the other plant
might not smell as strong, but then when
[SPEAKER_02]: you go to smoke it, it's like,
Ooh, that's the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes totally different than it
smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it just tastes louder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas sometimes they smell really good
and then it just doesn't translate into
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's always disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he got the one, the winner,
and it just smells like garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that the majority of stuff in
the dispensaries does that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to look at it or you see the samples,
like even in Oregon, some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that I checked out, it's like,
fuck, it looks pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you smell it and it's like,
it smells pretty good, but then you smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it and it's like, Ooh, like not
necessarily cardboard turps all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like lack of, lack of flavor or the
initial hit tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you're burning it down,
you kind of lose that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's kind of like a,
you know, byproduct to the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercialization.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are selecting for bag appeal or
high numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's unfortunately, the nose is like
the last thing selected for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a lot harder to select for the
flavor than it is for the look,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The look is very obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the flavor and all those things
are still somewhat subjective,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the look it's like, if it's frosted,
that's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the Oreos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's the Oreos looks frigging amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the smoke, it's my least
favorite thing pretty much to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have the worst auto flower
typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, honestly, the Oreos is like all
these things, you know, cause I don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge fan of apple fritter Oreos,
purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all one step away from being
good in one generation or one cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, you can find
something good in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely good genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely things that desirable
traits that can be passed on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when's the next cup that you're going
to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed a bunch of stuff going on this
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the class together with Dr. Zimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of other projects going
and kind of dropped the ball on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Oregon growers cup this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next year, like probably a few months
off, but there probably hit a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some interesting genetics for you to
check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little, a little care package of
stuff to try out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think there'll be some winners in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some unique, you know, I try to
breed for unique stuff with auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: yet you want the least amount of
phenotypical variation for what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to grow a row crop,
you definitely want something that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: up pretty even across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of like, that's what I was
saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of one of the
applications I see in the near future for
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you still see it, you see it popping
up now and again, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred acres of row crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost hands down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the obvious choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing a hundred, 200,
300 acres for extract, it's just cause
[SPEAKER_02]: they're so consistent and they're so
predictable as opposed to photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got, you know, greenhouse is okay,
but auto flowers, you know, it's very easy
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's grown like a row crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can pull a couple of harvests
without any infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some places you can pull three harvests a
year, maybe, maybe even four in some
[SPEAKER_02]: places, but typically like to be able to,
you know, the yields are really incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at scale, if you're talking about 1500
pounds is normal, but some people just
[SPEAKER_02]: crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like no infrastructure for pulling
tarp to light depth too, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even 3000 pounds, let's say you got
3000 pounds, you can do three pulls,
[SPEAKER_02]: the 9,000 pounds out of an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that with photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially not because you're getting
three, three bumps a year like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these do get you lit, but I feel like
this has a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as like we talk about the
effect, I like effect of this because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not like overly powerful in the sense that
I can smoke a big fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smoke a fucking joint of it,
feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like you spark some of these
equatorial land races or equatorial
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses even, you know, any of the sativa
stuff, these hazes where they don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling and you just keep smoking,
you get more high and more high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you get more high and then
it creeps up on you get even more high
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a bad experience with some,
some hash last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much, too panicky kept going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, there was no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kept getting more and more like a
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just a, just hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I did dab there for a little while and
I just, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, it just doesn't do it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I like flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like good rosin dabs, some good living,
like the live, live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love the, I like flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I chase flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly looking for something new
flavor wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite thing is, uh,
I guess it's got a little two inch plate
[SPEAKER_01]: press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but to do, to press flower and then do
the rosin and then just like drizzle it on
[SPEAKER_01]: a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the same flower on a pressed on
a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my, that's my go-to for sure.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something special about rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the effects from it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about soil outdoor versus living soil
indoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, what's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sun, the sun is special,
you know, uh, indoor lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got, I think I'm hooked up with best
company out there, uh, personal experience
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, it's, the sun's the sun,
you know, and then you could take plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cuttings from the same plant,
plant them on opposite sides of your
[SPEAKER_01]: property and have two different
expressions in those plants just because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the soil chemistry in those two
different locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that outside in the earth and
under the sun is very special.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're able to do that, I think you
should take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I, I pretty much committed to
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, I can't get stuff to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I pulled tarp or an auto flower finish
outside, but full term photos on the
[SPEAKER_01]: coast, or you saw how cool it gets at
night there in Lincoln city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this time of year, it's down
into the forties and like 80% humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough to get something to finish
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I do, I have a few plants outside
because they're special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love outdoor plants in the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just grow different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you have some place that
you can really, uh, put some, some energy
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil, uh, you can do some,
some awesome stuff in the earth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge fan of mixed light too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some mental lighting in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you get a little bit of sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of this stuff is top shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow really top shelf,
amazing sticky bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that on every level though,
in all reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think there's sticky bud that
can be grown in with every substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said though, it's, uh,
law changes and emissions and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, energy stuff coming down to the
pipeline, like, uh, mixed, mixed lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: may be a realistic thing in the near
future, as far as like indoor commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: production, especially in the cities and
pushing for the CO2 emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just read something ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was one of the arguments against
home growers is the, the, the CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: the extra CO2 emissions, you know,
and it was like, oh, like a hundred and
[SPEAKER_01]: 138 pounds of CO2 to grow a pound of
flour, dry flour produced like 138 pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: of CO2 for, well, I don't know what
average they used or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then like on the same, the opposite
side of that same coin, it's like an hour
[SPEAKER_01]: of a private jet creates two tons of CO2
and nobody's trying to stop those,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the home grower with the little,
with the, you know, 200 watt light that we
[SPEAKER_01]: is like the criminal and destroying the
environment, which is, you know,
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many people that try to
manipulate data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: All over and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have you experienced cannabis in any,
in any other parts of the world or pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much just the U S Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been able to go to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely on the, on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to go to Europe and have some
traditional hash and go to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to go for spandibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you're talking about,
you're going to go for spandibus in March.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring them, bring the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think Spain is an amazing place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The culture there is really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a big event where everybody from
around the world, we kind of get together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my same friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been friends with going to dinner for
the last, you know, on and off the last 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years, more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, and just great people from
people from Australia, people from South
[SPEAKER_02]: America, people from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Dutch guys over there,
the Spanish guys, but my friends from all
[SPEAKER_02]: over, some of them, I only see at that
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, and it's great seeing them
and hanging out and seeing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're up to and talking about the
genetics and cause genetics are kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: popping different all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think gelato is pretty much
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato crosses Thailand, Thailand blowing
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand's like fully emerged now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, that's, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to going to Thailand
one of these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't been there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think Spain, that's an easy sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife's been trying to get us over there
for years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's, it's so great to even
mention Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what a coincidence we're here in March
for spannibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have to check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you a free pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the food is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food in Spain is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food in Europe in general is really
good, but especially Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a start, start there
somewhere and train around for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people are looking for you on the
internet, you have a website, you have an
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, tell us a little bit about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So florofarm.com is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where my online, my living soil map
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: My masterclass is all going to be funneled
through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Instagram, florofarm, same,
same handle all across all the socials and
[SPEAKER_01]: my YouTube channel as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to spend a little more energy on
the YouTube, producing some media content
[SPEAKER_01]: for the, for the, for the class and
YouTube as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be more involved there than
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just so frustrating,
like censored constantly and post removed
[SPEAKER_01]: and playing that social media nonsense
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of, kind of burning out on
that end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to try to focus more on my,
my website and the YouTube side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've really been focused on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Instagram is still Instagram,
but we've, you know, I really like YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's been a lot of fun and I
got a great team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a great team of people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't smoke during work,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was great having you today,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really look forward to seeing you back
here and doing this again sometime and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe hopefully seeing you in Spain for
span of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know all your wife's friends that are
watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to tell your wife about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, your wife's probably going to watch
this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to watch this show and be
like, Hey, I see what you did there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy the tickets before the show comes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
Cheers.
