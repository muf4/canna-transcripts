I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today our special guest is Dave from
Preferred Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today, Dave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've actually been on the show,
not in person, but we've had your flower
[SPEAKER_00]: on our blind tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it went really well, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think they were even smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was the $10.80.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you blew everybody's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that tried it was, you know,
even the people that were in the room that
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it afterwards were like,
wow, this is amazing for the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you guys do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have mixed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take pride in your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I can't say enough good things
about your brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never seen that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm sure it was like a mixed
light bag or something you guys bought
[SPEAKER_05]: from a store from cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burned good.
[SPEAKER_05]: All those things that you think about both
next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that because rec needs to be put on
a spot a lot more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of issues, of course,
with stores and not pushing things and
[SPEAKER_05]: pushing their their house brands or
whatnot and package dates and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, things that are sitting on the
shelf for a long time where people
[SPEAKER_05]: discount were all flower kind of to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the biggest problem
with rec today is that the consumer isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the flower faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a surplus of product and a lot of
times it's not stored correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they buy it one time and they
don't like the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, man, this is garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they looked on the date,
it's like six or eight months old or even
[SPEAKER_00]: older than that in certain cases or the
you know, especially with joints and pre
[SPEAKER_00]: rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you can't have an old joint or
pre roll has to get consumed fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a shelf life and people
don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like what we do now is we try to we
try to, you know, do our best to pull
[SPEAKER_05]: things off the shelf and buy them back if
they've sat for so long or find the
[SPEAKER_05]: specific partners that are actually
pushing and selling through the weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they know the time where it has to get
discounted to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right.
[SPEAKER_05]: California rec is like a crazy,
crazy situation right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to track what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a beast and it's really hard to
tackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like so many things were
overlooked in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just wanted to get their license
and wanted to get product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these things that go along
with that, where if you want to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality, which is what is going to
get people to come back and buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's really it's really
technical and there's a lot of trial and
[SPEAKER_00]: error that goes along along with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think I mean, I've learned of
scale to have, you know, decent size
[SPEAKER_05]: grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the trickier part.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to sell all the weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to sell to more stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: But finding the right partners that
actually understand the brand and push it
[SPEAKER_05]: in a certain way, it works well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it stays fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not over ordering.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not over pushing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to kind of control the narrative
with the team.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my team has been on it heavy lately,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then how long do you have ways
in-house that you you store in and protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your weed before it goes out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it typically sit before it
goes out to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's it's kind of kind of varies,
of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's it's all about how fast the
store moves it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we get it to distribution and out out
on the shelf as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happening in about seven days right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a record breaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we'd make sure we have the
testing lined up as soon as it drops.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets picked up from the farm,
drops to distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Third party gets tested, packaged,
shipped to, you know, the distributor
[SPEAKER_05]: that's going to push it to the stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's already kind of sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the fastest to get it to least to
distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as soon as it gets to the shelves,
you never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these retailers now, they have
like distros that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like a big chain will have a specific
distro that distributes the product to
[SPEAKER_05]: each of the stores, which I really hate,
to be honest, because you can't control
[SPEAKER_05]: what's happening with that product and
when it gets to each of the stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even really know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have a date like exact date when
it's going to land on shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can push or see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all, you know, everyone's kind of
doing their own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the mom and pop shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the big chain shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are your thoughts on on
curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people, they're like,
oh, some stuff tastes good after two
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it fresh, but I think it's cultivar
specific as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love fresh weed is the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my philosophy is I want to get it out
to distribution and testing a little
[SPEAKER_05]: fresher than normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like right now, with Mixlite, we use Grove
bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really believe in the Grove bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it keeps it keeps it keeps it in
a better spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can you can put it in there a
little bit fresher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the time it makes to the to the
shelf, you pray that it's exactly where
[SPEAKER_05]: you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turblocks are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done collaborations with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a jar guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we talk about glass jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I use jars my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would have to twist my arm really
hard for me to even try the turblock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the product speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we put stuff on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do A.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: testing with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another one we did A.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: testing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we tested the turkey versus the
glass jar versus the big Grove bag like
[SPEAKER_05]: the pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come in so many different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have tote liners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and I have friends that
are putting Bavita packs in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: turblocks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never liked the Bavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they pull turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's just personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody has their own little way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we normally trim fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do put it in a turkey first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we move it over to a Grove bag when
we think it's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like when he gets in a Grove bag is
locked in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exactly it keeps it in stasis for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exactly where you have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you get the perfect cure and you get
it in the Grove bag, you're solid for two
[SPEAKER_05]: months.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's still colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a heck of a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't, then it's like stuff can
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do you control when you're in
hundreds of stores?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you control which distro van it
goes in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's using an HVAC in their distro?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who has a freezer van?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which store is storing it properly?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rare to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people talk about it as if it's
not rare, but it's rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be, you know, exactly to get
it exactly where you want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the model, you know, California is
its own unique beast as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like going from medical where it was
completely different to to rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the brands that came.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of the brands that we saw
were big with cultivation before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like those brands aren't
around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been around quite a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think I chose.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had the options.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone in the beginning had their
options.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone, you know, cannabis is sexy,
especially then all the investors are up
[SPEAKER_05]: your ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're sitting at your gate at the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any kind of cultivation
license, they can get a hold of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that's how it used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, no one's invested in cannabis,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not not in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like then I decided.
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched, you know, a lot of the bigger
guys and I had conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God I had like a lot of this inside
information that when they got the 25
[SPEAKER_05]: million dollar loan, when they partnered
with the the people that were great in the
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning and the devil in the end,
they they it always went bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all the stock deals,
all this crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always went bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've had like probably the biggest
opportunities in my lap in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've turned them all down just because
I knew it was too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I have one partner and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if we fail, it's on us for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I had so many friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably mutual friends that have gotten
burned over the years with some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: deals from whether it's Canadian companies
or big investors and then getting diluted
[SPEAKER_00]: out of their shares.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's really rough,
you know, and I think we're just in such a
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile industry, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so volatile on on every level,
you know, and people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is candy going to go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think candy is going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's going away anytime
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think gas and sour and things
like that are coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think they're coming back in
small spurts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've basically refused to grow LCGs and
runs for the longest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that a bunch of people backed off,
I put a handfuls of them into the garden,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, but I don't love them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow what I like to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow a lot of green weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's it always works for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just if it's high quality,
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we grow Z for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're that's what we want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like Z a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow G Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, that's people can't
sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say it's just got to put in the
effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be the right batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow or to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like the high isn't for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you handle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not going to grow 10000 pounds
of Z or G Kush, but I grow a good amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I would grow that stuff just
for myself to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love good OG, like that piney,
lemony, gassy, earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I sell all my own weed for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, if I truly enjoy it,
it's pretty easy for me to sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it's like it's a batch of OG
or Z or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put a high number on it and sell it
easier than a candy that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, yeah, you know, if you want
it, you can buy it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do mix light, too,
you're on a different level completely in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mix light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is competing with indoor somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it competes with it,
especially with flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mix light, I think, is the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always has been.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm known for mix light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mix light is the hardest to grow to also,
I feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like control in that kind
of environment is a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now at scale, I have a positive pressure
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even more of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet it looks super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But God, I think it's a bitch every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in those kind of greenhouses,
people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be more expensive than indoor
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't, they yield less.
[SPEAKER_05]: They yield less.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's hitting the same yields that they
hit in an indoor facility in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't control the environment perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's cheaper to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: More efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's your take on cocoa,
soil, rockwool, stonewool, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a cocoa guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've grown in everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, deep water culture, every single
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockwool, I still do trials of things all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I trial different Cocos too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I trial peat moss was like my favorite for
the longest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at scale, in my opinion, cocoa is the
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a one gallon cocoa bag is,
you still get almost the same control as a
[SPEAKER_05]: rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have a little bit more forgiveness
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you run a good lean crew,
you can run cocoa no problem and not have
[SPEAKER_05]: an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like cocoa is the nice mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix like cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right in the middle with the soil
and the rockwool and you're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I have no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use rockwool for certain applications
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as nursery applications,
I think it works really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and then soil, I really love the
flavor of soil, you know, when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to flavor, but as far as if you want
a product that yields really well and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think the effect of soil might
be a little bit better, but you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing tasting cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get amazing effect with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to check the boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so many variables there,
you know, and every facility is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Florida, we use rockwool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the head of cultivation is a
rockwool guy and he can steer the ship
[SPEAKER_05]: properly and the weed is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best rockwool weed that I've ever had
for sure is out there in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did cocoa at first and,
you know, it's not as this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so used to steering with rockwool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to be like, Hey,
you have to do cocoa in my rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the weed is super fire and it gets you
super high and it has mad flavor and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: undeniable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use rockwool there and certain
facilities I've used rockwool and had,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, better results.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the environment was different
and, you know, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_05]: factors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to really pinpoint why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil too, you know, a lot of people argue
soil is the greatest.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I've grown in a lot of soil
and had amazing batches.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, like overall, cocoa has been
the best, like overall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got away from cocoa because
the first time I used cocoa, it came in
[SPEAKER_00]: these bricks and, you know, we got these
bricks and I had to break them up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: kiddie pool with a shovel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm never doing this
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now like 20 years later, I ended up
going all cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using charcoal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried Kana Charcor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing trials with Kaia right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're testing out some cocoa with perlite
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like a 70 30 mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 70 30 mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the dry backs are good on
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even we're doing some trials with
moms using the big 10 inch blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm trying to compare that
to rockwool to really see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like with rockwool,
you have total control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get perfect dry backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like there's more of a buffer
with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With rockwool, I mean, you can really
steer every inch of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's always in like a large scale
facility, for instance, my greenhouse is
[SPEAKER_05]: 50,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a large base like 18,
20,000 square feet base with perpetual
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get some sediment in the line or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're letting lean, you know, we can't
just take out all the drippers,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to have a little bit of
buffer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we did trials back to back indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did tons of them with rockwool slabs,
rockwool cubes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cocoa, one gallon cocoa, two gallon
different brands of cocoa, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: twice washed, chippy cocoa, browned up
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I got the best flavor from is
what I'm really looking for is flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, our weed is going to get you
high was cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're working in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working in all kinds of other
states as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that going?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not all of it is great,
but it's like when you find the right
[SPEAKER_05]: people to work with, that's what really
matters.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're really successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that's what we're shooting for,
that's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found out, you know, certain
partners not to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a lot of like learning happening
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's so early still in the
game that we don't know what's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So doing licensing deals, consulting
partnerships in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to try it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Florida, what are some of the
challenges you guys faced over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they're still medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's the biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were supposed to, you know,
it was about to pass rec.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone thought it had to be like a 60
percent vote or something, and it didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been huge for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I kind of like where we're at right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's working really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is medical and you have to get a
medical card and a medical card costs two
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred and something dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's on a budget.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's harder to get a card in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like California how it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of challenges where
people want to get our product,
[SPEAKER_05]: but can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, there's still a good amount of
people that do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like there's some really
big brands and some really good brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some California brands and,
you know, it's in some guys that are
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants that have moved there and
they're doing really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunburned cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all about the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They support us, too, which is,
you know, this mega competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way more competitive in other states,
especially the East Coast is what I've
[SPEAKER_05]: noticed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like California, we're all collaborative,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you have your own grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not trying to kill each other at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all trying to help each other boost
up, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: High fives all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: All day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll like you can give me some
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share some knowledge with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other states?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot different, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like companies are way more
cutthroat.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more money being thrown
around and it's kind of a monopoly in
[SPEAKER_05]: places like Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of understandable,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: More business, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: But Florida has like a serious culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of like good smokers out
there, growers, and people know their
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it's our best market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better than California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they used to get their weed from
Colombia and Mexico, and now it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm partnered with The Flowery out there,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if you know much about
them, but they've just been nothing but
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing partners and like really great
people to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been eye opening to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: To want to do more and more projects,
other places to meet people and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, collaborate like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaboration is key these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's so hard to make it by
yourself, but then collaborating with
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, both brands can help lift
each other up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many ways to
collaborate on the genetics level like we
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like working with cultivation
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're working with Flow Gardens
in hemp in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to do some big projects with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric was on the show a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's indoor doing THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a great place for greenhouses.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do really good quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that, you know, it's like
working with other brands that are
[SPEAKER_00]: like-minded is always great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the focus is on quality,
I think that's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone that does that, which is kind
of a smaller circle, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: because the big MSO is they have the
option to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the money to like hire the
people, consultants or bring in like good
[SPEAKER_05]: growers that care.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of them have like a different
mindset and a different game plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no problem with that because
it's all about just getting money and
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever they need to do to get money.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's expensive to grow like fireweed and
it's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do they want the headache of that right
now when all their weeds sell in any ways
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's easier and it's cheaper for them
to sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a business model, you know,
so I can play, I play with like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can, I'm a consultant too, you know,
cause I've been growing for so long and I
[SPEAKER_05]: can like help facilities turn things
around if they want to get to quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can sit in the room with these suits
and I know like a lot of them are cool
[SPEAKER_05]: people too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, to be honest, but their mindset
is how do we get the most money out of
[SPEAKER_05]: this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're trying to build a massive
company right now and maybe in the future
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll convert their facilities to a
higher quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now on the spreadsheet,
it actually is like better for them to
[SPEAKER_05]: just sell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my focus is always on quality,
but I'm also genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like genetics, you have to have the
best quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you even do your own phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, S1s, F1s, I've been doing that for
years too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phenohunting is my thing though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been phenohunting since I first
started.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started with seeds, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the, all the homies, the bigger
breeders and stuff too, would always send
[SPEAKER_05]: me, I was the tester guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's like, I just love
seeing new shit always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every one of my facilities has an
outrageous amount of phenohunts going on
[SPEAKER_05]: at all times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know how important it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important moving forward and to
find new things that kind of resonate with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just cause I like something doesn't
mean everybody else is going to like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think I have a pretty good hand on
the pulse of what everybody wants to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a lot of
alignment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like with yourself,
it's like after you've done it for long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, you understand quality and I can
appreciate quality, but there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and it's very subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, you know,
wedding cakes no longer popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I just don't understand,
there's ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of hate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It yields too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody grows it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's an abundance of ice cream
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ice cream cake is amazing,
especially the rosin from ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in my opinion, it's also a good
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has a lot of breeding
potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made millions of dollars off of ice
cream cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't hate on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People trash it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all, you know, eventually it'll come
back once like the MSO started growing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was a ton of mid ice cream
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean throw the purple punch away,
but keep the ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill the fake turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's the Oreos and the
purple punches that have made their rounds
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, I think they're
one good cross away from being good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like you cross it with the right
thing and there's good potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we shouldn't get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they have... They need some power.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them power.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put some chem in them Oreos.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some GMO, some chem, some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that diesel.
I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what Pete like, all right,
this is how like we look at things right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a really small team.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have like a lot of like close
meetings.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at things as in the rec
market and all these other states and
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere else, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have this heady circle that we,
all we can think of is this heady circle,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This 1%, not even 1% of the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's this 99% that loves weed,
but they don't know weed like we know
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to buy the Oreos.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to buy the... And be happy
with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to get high from it
even, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: But like we're so fucking heady and stuck
in this 1% that we can't break out of and
[SPEAKER_05]: be successful with this 99%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to a dispensary and do an event.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do them all day, all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have data for days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had delivery services.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what people are buying,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not what we think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like us right here, we know too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to find people, new people in
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Test them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Test them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure out what they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the companies that are mega
successful that actually grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like pretty, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: But like the mad heady, like Z,
no fucking chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all street weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the trap weed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the trap weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll pay the most for it, but it's not
even 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even 1%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we all need to be successful somehow
and figure out how to merge this 99% with
[SPEAKER_05]: the 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're pushing it as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in this circle where we can kind of
dictate what's good and what's not in the
[SPEAKER_05]: heady side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can say we can bring up a strain,
a cross or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of guys that, you know,
I'm with can say it's amazing and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But only in that heady circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in what really matters in the stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who's successful in the stores?
[SPEAKER_05]: I look up to that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dream crushes it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just dropped blue dream and it fucking
sold out in like two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to show you some of my blue
dream crosses that I made that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream, but also something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, yeah, we have dream candy and
we have different Finos and we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: renaming the different Finos because we
have one that's really candy, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very, you smell it and you're like,
it's straight nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dream's fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: MSO's got a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It pumps out four pounds of light with
your eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was millions and millions of pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get sick of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it was still craft and small
where only a handful of people had it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was top shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got so much flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds were perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was big.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grew blue dream for like a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had to call it platinum blue dream because
everyone had blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it lasted another year and then it
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it completely died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour's making a comeback though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people growing sour again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I've loved for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not have the best structure,
but the back of the day, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ugliest weed was also the most expensive
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catpiss was the ugliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like when we got it, it was shreds
in a bag and it was $60 an eighth all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before people had to see what it looked
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: New York dictates a lot honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sour was like, I started from soil
and outdoor in the hills.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: When all my sour was sold, you better find
the neighbor's sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because New York would just eat everything
alive somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever was getting it in Sacramento or
whatever, I guarantee it was getting to
[SPEAKER_05]: New York because no one really cared for
it in Northern California at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they still want it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that taste for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just came from New York actually and I
just pulled a bunch of data from stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flowery, I'm partnered with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be the biggest chain in
New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have five stores right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have eight in the next
two months and then 10 or 11 real soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just good.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the top selling skew of flower is
sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's real sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt the shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real sour, but it's sour name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started seeing real sour come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one of the guys on the podcast,
Dave from Budge Laro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my friend Josh, he's growing real
sour again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in California and it's the real real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew Green Dog had a real sour for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we were growing a sour BX1 that
definitely had the sour smell and
[SPEAKER_05]: structure, but it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been so many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always like, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had some here to show you because
when you see the real sour again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unmistakable what real sour is once
you see it again, if you experienced it
[SPEAKER_00]: for enough time in your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like super silver haze and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some of that here actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love super silver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the turps on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the strength of it and maybe it's
not the first thing I go to every time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives you some anxiety.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it just depends on what you like,
but it's better than candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those good hazes, you got to
switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they have amazing candy out
there, but it's just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one color in the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people like candy because it goes
back to New York too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It cuts through a blunt for some weird
reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it's not great and it doesn't even
have a great smell, or nothing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you taste it through a blunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better than you do through a joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a weird strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like turped weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's those blunt smokers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, with the grabba and they're mixing
tobacco with the blunts and yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: the turped weed, that shit's garbage
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept it's like, oh, well they turp
carts and it's like, I wouldn't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: those either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like the top mover and people are
making- Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000 a pound for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean like the carts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even listen to the turp sprayed
shit because most of it's probably poison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what the hell they're doing with
most of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it's done right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's facilities that use some
crazy machine to do it, but you're still
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking something weird that smells like
bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about the rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like carts for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go back and forth with, do I like carts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I not like carts?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rosin half gram carts,
I think that's the magic number.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's half gram and good rosin carts are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's a more natural
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cryo trimmer, I don't know if you've
seen that, but they have the resonator
[SPEAKER_00]: does a cryo trimmer where they pump liquid
CO2 in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate trim machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely hate trim machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw this the other day and I've
heard about it for a long time and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe anything till I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going and seeing the demo,
it changed my mind for a trim machine
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm just so anti.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still got to finish it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can actually press rosin from
the Keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: You separate, they have bags that go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can separate your different layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your 200 micron, your 150 and
your 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can capture the 50 to 150,
then press it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty good rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not endorsed by them or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think the product is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're doing some sort
of hand rolls or pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a place for trim machines
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there is big scale, large
greenhouses that you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to get the quality you need out of.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're doing pre-rolls, if you're doing
cheap half ounces and you can't make a
[SPEAKER_05]: margin off a hand trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's the biggest expense in every
cultivation facility is the trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this you can do 400 pounds a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the trim, it ends up costing
you less than $20 a pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy that we've gone that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played with the Mobius a million
times and a bunch of different facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the best of that, from what I've
seen of that situation, but I fucking hate
[SPEAKER_05]: trim machines for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they fuck it up every time,
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this doesn't cut it, it actually has
a net that looks like fishnet that women
[SPEAKER_00]: wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's stretched over this thing and it
gently tumbles the stuff and it knocks the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked into the microscope before
and after, and then I smoked the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're sending lab results in now
to make sure that we're not losing
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends are super stoked on it and I
think the potential for it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you said that because I'm
licensed in Pennsylvania and they use a
[SPEAKER_05]: Mobius because it's just so hard to get
employees out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they use a Mobius, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And testing results, it's so weird in
every state, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing is all bullshit for the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's really landed the proper testing
yet to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no consistency.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is consistency in each state.
[SPEAKER_05]: For whatever that consistency is,
if you know what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if everything's hitting sub 20% for the
most part coming out of this trim machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had them do some hand trim,
pass in the hand trim stuff, scope it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there's a lot of heads knocked
off from the trim machines and there's
[SPEAKER_05]: damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also like chunks of leafs
stuck in the bud from the trim machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're doing super light pass,
a little hand work on the outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the most expensive trimmer or
whatever, the Mobius.
[SPEAKER_05]: And test results are much better when you
hand trim in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just FYI, it was just something that we
did just to see if it... Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kind of hippie trimmed it too,
just to try to not touch it as much as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got better results from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting all these things coming
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: New technology comes out every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a lot of innovation in the
last little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, other than lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Under Canopies has been probably the
biggest innovation and cultivation that...
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends in greenhouses that over
this winter are just using Under Canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: with low PPFD from the sun and they're
getting really good results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Under Canopies in my greenhouse
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a huge believer in Under Canopy lights
as much as I fucking hate looking at them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those favance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the game changer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Under Canopy for yield especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with LED lights, you're
getting more purple now on the bottom than
[SPEAKER_05]: you're on the tops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even... Not just the bottoms that
you benefit from.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the cool thing about Under Canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing that people don't really
understand about it is the yield comes
[SPEAKER_05]: from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant is absorbing light and it
just... Even if you stripped off
[SPEAKER_05]: everything on the bottom, you're going to
gain from Under Canopy lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think... More lights, different
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the less labor factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're only pulling fan leaves and
you're not having to completely clean out
[SPEAKER_00]: the undercarriage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that'll save you some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the period of a year,
five years, that can be significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had them for a long time at this
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Craft Farmer first kind of dropped
them, Faven right at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: we did them all, a bunch of side-by-sides
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it's more labor for us because I
wasn't a proponent of heavy de-leafing and
[SPEAKER_05]: stripping anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't de-leafing anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not to an extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found the even medium of having less
plant count, gaining more, getting higher
[SPEAKER_05]: yields from less plant count, still having
my solar panels on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at my plants, they're always
pretty full for the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe in stripping the dog shit
out of them because I did it for so many
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I did side-by-sides with less
plants and leaving them alone a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more, I got better results in quality,
in yields all the way across the board,
[SPEAKER_05]: like non-top plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's more labor for us to do the
under-canopies, but it's so minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get such a gain from it that it
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more nutrients, more water use,
more dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is things you got to consider.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But its yields are way better.
[SPEAKER_05]: The quality is the same, if not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same if not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So per four-by-four, how many plants do
you put typically?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine right now at most.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing nine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that nine is a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of guys do 12, 15, 20, one plant per
square.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy that was doing skittles was doing
25 to get three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool for what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoes come with that, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's doing under-canopy,
and I think he uses nine, and he's getting
[SPEAKER_05]: three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do like six in Florida, six plants per
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every nug is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my buddy does like- You know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do that, every bud is perfect.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might lose a little bit of yield,
but every piece of it is perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Packable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
Packable is an amazing taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all depends on what you're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're pushing bags like turkeys,
then you might want to put a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more plants, but not too many where it
causes, it depends on what your
[SPEAKER_05]: calculations are on dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_05]: HVAC, all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's your room set up?
[SPEAKER_05]: But packaged goods, less plants is way
better because you can package every bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest part of cultivation
where people screw up is their
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that time and time and time again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always, and then you add a DU,
and you try, and you're out of power,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're still not enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's normally the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it used to be the guys with the
reservoirs in their rooms and wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: why they couldn't dehumidify their stuff
properly, and it's like, you got to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, PM and blood rot and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was pretty standard 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It evolved a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Jungle Boys, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone kind of took what they were,
saw what they were doing and took that and
[SPEAKER_05]: tried to better it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it isn't evolving much from there,
if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like you said, what's the new
innovation in this space?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a ton.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's so fucking busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Though, every second counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've thought about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to put energy into these
things?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to put energy into the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to put energy into the grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you stop putting energy into the
grow, you're totally fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it worth putting energy into these
other things?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I like the light lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that for dialing PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to use yo-yos, and so it's nice to
be able to have it on an iPad where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it up and down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's another trick and toy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do the proper research,
it's worth it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people just have light lifters to
have them because it was kind of cool to
[SPEAKER_05]: put them in in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: DPS was putting them in a lot of these
big, huge, massive grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango has his own version of the light
lift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sure he's doing his research.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's all about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you got someone to put in the work and
spreadsheet it out and see if you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: an extra five grams of square foot and
it's worth it all day, then you can move
[SPEAKER_05]: them around and it's worth the headache of
you're going to have to fix them here and
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another piece that can break,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't build them with them just F-wide,
but maybe I would if you proved to me that
[SPEAKER_05]: it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the data here soon enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and then also with the Phaven and
versus the Phaven and also combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Phaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do seed production on that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be able to get some numbers on
what kind of seed production that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited about getting my numbers
up really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're at fifty thousand seeds per
light for four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now we're talking about something
different that no one really thinks about
[SPEAKER_05]: much other than Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in cannabis, who's actually like,
oh, this is how many seeds I'm getting per
[SPEAKER_05]: square foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I've ever heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with autoflowers, it's like we do
autoflowers seed production, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like we do photo period and
that's it's very cultivar dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with autoflowers, I'm getting really
high numbers across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how high can I push that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me really excited because,
you know, it's like with the indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you can really control
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you do it in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can you can almost control everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor, you can't control any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get pollen from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do an acre in the middle of a regular
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than likely, you're going to have
some sort of cross contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, depends on the county, depends on
the region, depends on a million different
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to grow it for cheaper,
you would probably put it in like a mix
[SPEAKER_05]: light or a greenhouse facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it depends on the volume you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can push through that amount,
then you need to get as much yield as you
[SPEAKER_05]: possibly can per square foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: With seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to be quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get really good quality
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the the pheavans and I believe this is
my first time running pheavans with seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production, but I believe we are going to
get even seeds from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the stuff on the bottom,
they're not as nice as the stuff on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get lighter seeds and then we got to
separate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even seeds across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that could be a big game
changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like new shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing with me and cultivation
and all that is that's why I feno hunt so
[SPEAKER_05]: much because I wouldn't grow weed if I
couldn't feno hunt, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can't see a new strains like on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just have to grow like a fucking
acre of candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go and do something different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could if working this hard,
you could you're going to make money doing
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel you, especially if you're a
hard worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to almost any industry and
figure out how to make it if you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: it in this industry with as hard as it is
to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and there's something special about
seeing new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the stressful part either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I find weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get I get excited about the strangest
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had one that smelled kind of
like vomit and it's like so disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you want all your
friends to smell it because it's so out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the thug pug, all the thug pug work
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd always have like some raunchy like
weird smelling stuff that was either like
[SPEAKER_05]: like rotten chocolate or totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different turps would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's kind of like what's new now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not a lot of new stuff,
but there there is still you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still seeing new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going back to the drawing
board with some land race varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically germinating them here and then
taking them out to everybody else and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what we can do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of stuff is like we get so
bottlenecked, especially in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, like candy, candy, candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got to have it has to be candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to have color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's great for the people to
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many other things that you
can share.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love like Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they fucking know good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they they like green weed more than
they like candy and purple weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the turps are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like cool shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just like turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like they want it to taste crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like like citrus is like probably most
poppin thing in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Cali, it was like dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera is the least like strain in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also something I really like if
it's done well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these guys that are newer,
they never got to experience the good Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, in the 90s and the
early 2000s, there was amazing Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was amazing Jack Crosses,
Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was some of the best shit I ever seen
in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small badge.
[SPEAKER_05]: People cared for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real farmers putting in the work and
actually like focusing on their plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when, you know, the MSOs are growing
massive amounts of Jack, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: held amid Jack and all they're going to be
able to get at the store for cheap is Jack
[SPEAKER_05]: that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But smells good regardless.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it still smells good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Windexy smelling Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like I don't like the high that
much, but no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't either from Jack, but there was I
can't even think of the brand that's down
[SPEAKER_00]: in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're still there, but they have
their own Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's not it's funky, Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nose burning, but like really
high on that tropinoline limonene and like
[SPEAKER_00]: like a haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely that cleaner,
like where it burns your nostrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you smell it, it goes to burn
your nostrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the high from it was very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack typically didn't have a strong eye,
like especially the stuff I see now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jack Flash, it was like this funky,
lemony, amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked it had the bag appeal and it
was so sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could thumb a bud under the wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was so that was the good times.
[SPEAKER_05]: California kind of fucked that up with the
smoke ability and the burn and you can't
[SPEAKER_05]: have like cracked out stick weed that you
can stick on the wall is not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: ignite the way that you wanted to ignite
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that stuff won't even go through
the grinding grinder, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it sticks to your grind.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how the Florida weed is right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like Brian out there, he's just fucking
super heady grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy, Trent, he's he's like the
cure guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like when there's a cure guy who's
focused on fucking dry cure like this guy
[SPEAKER_05]: is, it changes the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fucking weed out there,
you we stick it to the wall all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like whenever I get my samples,
I'll be in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stick it to the wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll still be stuck to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you know it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's that comes with a lot of
babying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 100,000 square foot facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you like Burt bags 12 times a day
and make sure like check the exact
[SPEAKER_05]: humidities and make sure and you're in a
challenging spot, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like near Miami, like the outside is
ruthless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the beauty of the turplock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they basically eat up CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absorb CO2 through the liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you don't need to burp them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you still you bring that outside in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the turplock stands no chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: The best thing there is stands no chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a jar way worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets crushed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought some interesting flour today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought some flavors for us to sniff
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want to look at some
things now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the the mix light Z that's in a big
competition right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're following along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's popping off really quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Proper doings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are all about their indoors,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like high and indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they they have never supposedly had
any like mix light or outdoor or any sun
[SPEAKER_05]: grown stuff that's been any good at all
that that burns.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they like things that burn
clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want a specific drip thing that
they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're they're really fucking good with
with like what they're you know what they
[SPEAKER_05]: do and what what defines quality to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, I was like, I'm an old school
kind of farmer guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, I was like, fuck these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm like, these guys know what they're
talking about, honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're they they stir the pot a lot,
which is kind of like important to do in
[SPEAKER_05]: their space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're also very strict about what
they like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's and they're not like we're homies
and they're going to be like, this is not
[SPEAKER_05]: trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone like they'll bring on all their
friends and it's all batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to get clowned here and
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got to be willing to take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of hard for people to grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys are having fun with it,
too, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then you got to think it's
would be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So someone on X said, have you ever tried
Dave's mix light?
[SPEAKER_05]: They've smoked a bunch of my indoor,
you know, and certain things they love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other things, maybe not so much because
it's probably like a stickier,
[SPEAKER_05]: more, you know, what something that I like
a little bit more is maybe not what they
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was like, yeah, I got some I just
got back from New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I got some mix light for you
guys right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, you want to go up against
some indoor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam said that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, yeah, of your choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he's like, what strains you got?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was and I heard they had this Z
competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, actually, I got some Z mix
light Z.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, oh, well, BZ put ten
thousand dollars on his mix light or his
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor Z up against anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to prove that mix light is just as
good, if not better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, you know, weed is weed is weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireweed is fireweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had outdoor that's mad flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smokes amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown it mix light.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stand on pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's it's the most challenging
weed there is where people think that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like depths.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but it's I think it's the best
of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indoor plus is what we're kind of talking
about because we have HBS lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have environmental controls where we
have benches, drippers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have everything that indoor facility
has.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I grow indoor to everything that my
indoor facility has.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also got the option of the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got another spectrum that you can't
you can't mimic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun does something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stand on a lot of mix light,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some batches I would choose over indoor
any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's the best of both
worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the most economical and best
as far as like if you want to indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: product, it's better for the earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a lot of pluses there,
but we don't even need to talk about that
[SPEAKER_05]: in a competition like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now everyone's, you know, oh,
you're putting mix light in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could beat that all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten thousand, ten thousand, ten thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just mentioned me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says sixty thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave actually won sixty thousand dollars
in the proper doings contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now back to this episode with Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Z is one of those ones where
the turps really, you know, it's like we
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about cocoa versus soil Z,
especially the soil brings out something
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like Z, you can you can
get these different expressions and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the genetics out there,
you don't see as much with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates and the different lights and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Z is very noticeable with each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was wondering because Z was
probably bred outside in soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: right under the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was thinking about that when you
just said the seed thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always thought that there's
specific like things that need to happen
[SPEAKER_05]: with breeding, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you're breeding under LEDs and
you're feno hunting under LEDs and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: choosing things under these.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I feno hunt in my greenhouse
at now, I can kind of fine tune and figure
[SPEAKER_05]: out what I think will do well indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it always isn't the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I feno hunt indoor, it's so
controlled.
[SPEAKER_05]: That everything's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't have too much variable and
less like hermaphrodites happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of a lot of things happen when you
have like that controlled of an
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love feno hunting in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because tomorrow it's freezing balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next day, it's raining.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stress testing at the same time all
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder with breeding, though,
you know, I've always bred in like a
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking shed or outside or in a
greenhouse, like a shitty greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wonder with breeding if there's
going to be some adaptations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be some things that it's
a baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's used to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not always going to work in that
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you feno hunt it this way,
I know for a fact, you're sure you're
[SPEAKER_05]: hunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, it's like if we're
doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even use that seed start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rid of the seed start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a clone and we feno hunt starting
with the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even I don't want to know what
that seed start expression looks like if I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking for stuff to license.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking stuff that we're going to
take clones off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now if I'm going to sell the seeds for
outdoor production, like flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production, I want it grown outdoors where
we're feno hunting outdoors where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: go this one's good for this reason or this
one because it's totally different.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ideal, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're so when you feno hunt,
you pop your seed, germinate your seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: you germinate it in a substrate or you do
it in a towel or put it in water.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious because you got a lot of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's different
depending on what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically with feno hunting,
if there's from somebody else,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take hydrogen peroxide and
I'm going to do a six to one ratio with
[SPEAKER_00]: water to hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to soak it in there typically
overnight or 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why hydrogen peroxide?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sterilizes the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it can kill a lot of bad
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we basically take that and it gives it
a little bit of a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working now with a clean
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll go into a rapid root or root
riot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You like it in a clone plug right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like it in the plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it works the best when you go
into a plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have a root shooting at
the bottom, then it goes right into
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever we're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty and then you take one
clone from you build the mom up for what?
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 days or 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even depending on the cultivar,
some grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are super vigorous and we could take
them in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but typically it's you take the
top though.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you take that top, you plug that
top, you root that top, then you feno hunt
[SPEAKER_05]: with that top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times we'll go till we can
get two clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't just take the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might go, we might go a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might go five weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to get to three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've found that in greenhouses was
stabilizing for some weird reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can explain why first cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well seed, you're going to have way more
hermaphrodites than normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a different plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The weed is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smokes different, smells different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's different about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pointless to feno hunt with the seed
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first cut, I find that I get a little
bit more not stable things happening also
[SPEAKER_05]: from that top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second cut might be the same as the third
cut, but I just have a process of liking
[SPEAKER_05]: to have the third cut be the feno hunt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and we do cut from the third for,
we feno hunt that one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually from the second, we start
there for the, well, so from the first cut
[SPEAKER_00]: we can start there and then from the
second and third, but you will get sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is going to change over time
and you will get more expressions,
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets more stable kind of over time,
or it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's going to be that, it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find out and it's going to be that
solid expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get for a longer amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which you're going to get forever after.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I feel is what it normally is,
is what you're going to get forever off of
[SPEAKER_05]: that third, third generation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third and fourth clonal generation is
where you, it stabilizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've randomly had things like herm for,
since they probably had, they were in the
[SPEAKER_05]: spring and they probably had a nice
environment and then winter came around
[SPEAKER_05]: and they hermed out of nowhere,
you know, something that was still kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: early range.
[SPEAKER_05]: But normally like if it's stable,
it's stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one exception for phenohunting from
seed would be if you are selling seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: be grown out in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm going to sell a hundred thousand
seeds to somebody, I'm going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what a hundred of those seeds or a
thousand of those seeds do when we put
[SPEAKER_00]: them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we will put them outside and grow
them out and test them that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you are going to sell your
seeds in bulk for someone in Morocco,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone in Germany or wherever,
wherever it is, and you're going to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is where they're going to
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a hundred thousand, right.
And that's the major thing I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think it's a great way to do
things that are around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of your people think
that whatever you do, that goes beyond the
science.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a science that's like,
oh, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the science you're doing, you're doing
this and you're doing, you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the thing is, if you're talking about,
let's say, at the beginning of the year,
you're a dude, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually like, option.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm one of the only people
that has an indoor and outdoor and a mix
[SPEAKER_05]: light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and so we work with cultivation
partners all over, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with people in multiple states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have guys that are just itching to test
something new because we always have weird
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or fun stuff or different stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: People beg to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put it in the closet too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like cool to give it to those people
and they find stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a ton of people that love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that third and fourth clonal
generation is really where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like growing things out at least
three times before we run with anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've seen stuff that it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next time it's shit and then
it's amazing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also seen the opposite where
it's not that great, but it's still it
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be the best of the best,
but we grow it the second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we grow it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even just on its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of just like picks that to get to
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes three kind of rounds anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we always do the test.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second test is like you might start
with three plants, then you get up to 10
[SPEAKER_05]: plants before you get to 100 plus plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go too big too quickly
with stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is what I like
sometimes isn't what everybody likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get excited about some weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to put that into
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to see what kind of response you
get from people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm jumping up and down about this
new thing, because we've never had this
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like this crazy floral thing that
I think is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you give it out to guys like
Freddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the amazing palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freddie Big, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the guys that gets to see
stuff before it even goes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's the guy who's got a palette too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a real palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes he'll be like, no,
that's not it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if it is it, I want one bag.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and he's just super honest about
what he likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows what he likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the circle I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those type of guys dictate what is good
and what isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to have them around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you're just blessed to have them
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God they're around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them as much free weed as you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my guy from Hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the pickiest person I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he works with Beezy and those guys
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of the same circle of
connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are so picky on the way it
burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, this stuff looks good
and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you roll it in a joint,
it just doesn't burn quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, to me, it's some super
grade A, triple A plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like for the streets,
maybe it's not what the streets want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing is everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they all have different palates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you get to that 1%, that most
extreme palette, sometimes they fuck it up
[SPEAKER_05]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some shit is actually really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing for the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has the most medicinal factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we think about that a lot too,
because we're in the medical market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, started in the medical market in
California, in the medical market in
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida now, in the medical market in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same market as before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people treat the weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like medicine, which I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's reasons for certain strains that
are extra powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they take away pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start talking about the effect more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think even in rec, it's still
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're calling it rec or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you like it or not, you're
ingesting medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the conversation needs to
come back to, how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how does it taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how does it make you feel at the end
of the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something you want to keep smoking
all day long?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to wake up tomorrow and keep
smoking that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you're on to something.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Z has done there for a lot of
people, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Z still does that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially business people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like something that, I don't know,
like an upper echelon loves Z.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that they would like it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the feeling of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the feeling you get from it is the
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can still be very creative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't knock you out either,
which is a plus when you're trying to run
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of employees and doing other
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just smoke hella OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lawyer used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lawyer, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, those guys are whack jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this guy used to smoke only OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all he would smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would smoke it all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are different.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some people that are like the most
successful ever and their brain is like
[SPEAKER_05]: too wired and they need something to crack
them down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just weed is weird and it works with
everybody different.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny because, yeah, the effect
can be subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me smell that Z you have right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the soil grown Z, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dirty Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll win you the $60,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put this in right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make it $70,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big of a sample do I need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I really think an eighth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You call them right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got 10 K.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I need, I need another, I need
another 10 K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to, we can smoke
this right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is, this is smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the old batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When was it harvested?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from November, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the funny thing with Skittles is when
it's done and it's dried, it is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, I like it fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, Oh, two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need two weeks on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for the smoke or whatever you want
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it's the loudest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open a bag of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like just freshly trimmed and dried
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pops like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it hits you with that candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially a pound, like a pound bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open a turkey bag or a turplock bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just punches you in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that about flower and you don't
get that with a lot of the stuff now where
[SPEAKER_00]: it hits you in the face, like where like
literally it sticks to your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's the main thing we hunt for
is that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of strains that people
like want really bad that doesn't do that,
[SPEAKER_05]: which kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know Mark from green
shock, but he had some, it's called the
[SPEAKER_00]: double lantern and it's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the best outdoor I saw last
year, by the way, big shout out to Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was gassy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's out here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grass Valley is cheat code.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the best spot to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, it's so dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had a greenhouse out there,
game on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like growers out there too.
[SPEAKER_05]: People like, they're all about that life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Christian's out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Christian too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good mutual friend of both of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him for quite a while and just
a solid dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, my buddy used to hit kick-ass
farms was his brand, but he used to do
[SPEAKER_00]: stock splitting where you'd grow the plant
up and you'd split the stock with a buck
[SPEAKER_05]: knife.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could only do that in grass valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like some weird kind of super
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically, you don't need a top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it does the, it distributes the
hormones evenly across the plant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get all these extra blood sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it bro science though?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've still, I still don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I saw his plants were huge too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd have these big 10 pounders with all
the small buds rather than one big,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were like big trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to also water his plants from the
top in the, in the, no, in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd water them from the top and the
bottom in the afternoon, he water them
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bottom to cool the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was doing that all the way into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like shaking my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is this guy doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got, he's reversing the magnetism of
the water and you know, it was pretty wild
[SPEAKER_00]: and he grew some of the best flowers I've
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's special because grass valley is
so dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tried to do that in Humboldt or in
Mendo on the coast, you'd be toast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have the worst rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: With all your breeding and stuff,
you're pretty heavy on like vigor and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, mold resistance and all those
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those even a major factor yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think commercial viability is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's not the only thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: First I go over the other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's like, okay, well I have a lot of
people that are like, I need something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to yield for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys, and I have some of my best
stuff doesn't yield, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So my favorite things don't yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this thing, although my friend gets
over three a light with Skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he also does, the secret is seven week
veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: He does a pre-veg and a veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to crack the code.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're onto something I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on cleaning it somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just playing around with whatever
weird science we can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know some people that have,
that are doing pretty well with it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't know if it changes like
anything in the quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my worry, but we're going to
over-veg it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over-vegging, topping it and then keeping
it even.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think keeping the canopy nice and even.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think every environment is a little
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's this Z grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some special stuff grown in the
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: SF Canna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: SF Canna.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working on collaborations
and I love Organotips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the glass tips personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass tips are okay, but I prefer the
bamboo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these guys are the homies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do these joints in Florida too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But paper-wise, what do you prefer
paper-wise?
[SPEAKER_05]: Elements are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some OCB XXLs right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're cleaner, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like when you roll them,
they look nice and super tidy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Elements don't stick that well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one problem that I have with them,
but I feel like they burn the best in
[SPEAKER_05]: Elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trialed all the different papers and I
feel like Elements burn the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have OCB in the trial really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are probably the expert XXL.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is probably the one that goes up to
them the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know proper joints in them just did some
weird tests with it and had some problems
[SPEAKER_05]: with them, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the rollers use those or Elements.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Mike and Malane.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you know them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're on the squad.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're professional rollers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They crush it, but they mainly use those
OCBs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we work with Hushle Hawaii,
professional joint roller at Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, he does amazing stuff, but then I'm
a fan of Bruno Roles and CGO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sacramento has all the best fucking
rollers, growers, everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like a lot of heady shit going
on in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like SAC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We stand on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm born and raised, so Sacramento is
home, but it's pretty cool that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: become super fucking famous for fireweed
and dope rollers and a lot of culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: People got a lot of shit from the police
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Sacramento, they were way harder on
people than everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're electricity companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are going to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I think in California,
it was pretty fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: SoCal, you could ride around with a
thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get pulled over and get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they were fucking taking people to
prison in NorCal, it was super weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there, whoever the power company is,
they were basically working with law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Snorting people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been raided, but for that same
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's like, I mean, we obviously,
PG&E, Oakland, it's like they don't give a
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want their money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pay the bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you don't let it lapse like
once or twice, then you're hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, NorCal is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you noticed that because I felt
like you can get away with whatever in
[SPEAKER_05]: SoCal in LA for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, the warehouses people,
that's where the real warehouses started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thousands of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, literally thousand lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people were way before anywhere
else in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jungle Boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jungle Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were doing it, you know,
scale, quality, really kind of pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, setting the ground for everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had a million followers before
anybody else too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God they did though, because I feel
like we wouldn't be here doing that if
[SPEAKER_05]: they didn't do it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been a journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's it going next?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in international?
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the morning I'm going to Portugal to
look at a facility.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like last second, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all GMP stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: GMP certification.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like from what I understand is
everything, if you want to get product to
[SPEAKER_05]: like Germany and, you know, the EU for the
most part, it has to go through Portugal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to figure out who needs help
in Portugal, because that's where I'd like
[SPEAKER_05]: to make my way out there from Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going there in the morning
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good time to go, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal's hot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people paved the way so
that Portugal could happen, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse was in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're still in Portugal,
but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you probably have your finger on it
more than me, because I feel like with the
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and you were doing stuff with a lot
of those guys that are out there in Europe
[SPEAKER_05]: and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we have a name in Europe and
people have somehow found a way to get our
[SPEAKER_05]: products in Europe, but we don't really
have a place there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we're going to spend some
time out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do Spantibus, but I think
we're going to do Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be at Mary Jane for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be at Spantibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Spantibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm excited for Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't go last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed out on Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got FOMO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard it was the biggest and best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we decided we're going to do
like a booth and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll actually be with Grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing an activation out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a big seed drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be doing dinner parties and lots
of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, let's let's link out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's like our first time being
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's you got to go to
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to Amsterdam, Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the places they go for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go before or after at least one of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I hear it's a must.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam is still pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all getting shut down in Amsterdam
for the most part or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it's getting shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it's not what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona used to be just popping like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to the restaurant and roll a
joint up and nobody would blink twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be smelling like weed
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they'll they'll mess with you a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do have social clubs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, both places, you know,
they have coffee shops in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have amazing coffee shops there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have amazing social clubs in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are really passionate about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good you can find good flour in
both places if you know where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and there's all kinds of great food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this stuff is extremely
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get an idea on what it would
taste like if it was super fresh indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: grown Bay Area, indoor grown Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_05]: How big are those batches?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small, small, small batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not grown at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is grown boutique for those ten
thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I love the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the friendly competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing with proper doings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like posting it all on Instagram
and I feel like you guys are having really
[SPEAKER_00]: fun with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I got Phil Emerson on the team.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're fucking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, no one wants to start that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was the star shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cook you up in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the back and forth is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe, you know, there's there's
some guys that take themselves just too
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, you know,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, because we should be able to have
those competitions and talk shit and all
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you get but her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in good fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one needs to throw punches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good weed is good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure all the Z is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for ten thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can light them up side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 10K by and not everyone can do that,
you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to be pretty confident and at
least stand in the chance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got to be really confident
throughout 10K and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 10K is 10K.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care how much.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much money you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone has a batch at the right time
is what it really comes down to in
[SPEAKER_05]: competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who has the batch at the right time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the best that day?
[SPEAKER_05]: That day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could be like who everyone thinks
is like the smallest or shittiest grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Alfred Master Yoda told me this a long
time ago when I won my first cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said and I was in Amsterdam in 2012 and
he said it's it's not always the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so some of these guys that
win, it's like at least with the fair
[SPEAKER_00]: competitions, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The real ones, which I think are getting
better and better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like the reason I did it with
them is because I I like how they judge
[SPEAKER_05]: things, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they they have a pretty
distinct palette and it's extreme what
[SPEAKER_05]: they think about quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen them dog like their own
person who grows their weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen them dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their own weed online.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, I trust what they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it in your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're addicted to the soil, Z,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be addicted to it to the second you
taste it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You you smoke a lot of OG and cam and I
smoke a lot of everything, but I like I
[SPEAKER_00]: like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking on some creepy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like an old school G cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gassy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your favorite, though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Capis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no capis anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I had to pick my favorite thing in
the whole world, it'd be capis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_05]: When's the last time you had it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had so many imposters over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the capis I remember was a I
would say it was super silver haze was was
[SPEAKER_00]: in capis that I had, you know,
but it had the worst structure and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't gassy like OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like straight skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tenth of a gram would smell the whole room
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Capis was fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a lot of strains were fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the turps were better than not
better, but more distinct from grow to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everyone wasn't using fucking
Athena or whatever the whatever the
[SPEAKER_05]: hottest, the cheapest salt brand there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that's a big play on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can only get so many different
substrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's cool to see some soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I you know, at scale, that's a little
tough to be able to steer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to be super batch to
batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: With soil, that's the one thing I would
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I got this down about a half inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the neck bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some decent ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some really good drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do like this thing is dripping like crazy
for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for skittles, a lot of guys,
their skittles don't drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's you know, I think you can get
an oil ring on anything or I'll take this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's burning kind of dark,
like in between, you know, but it tastes
[SPEAKER_05]: really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the fact that it's burning,
not not bone white and tastes good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would have rolled that a little
tighter, it might burn a little wider,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is this is going to air
after the proper joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, the ash isn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely get critiqued on the ash on
this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not a hundred percent on that
always.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OGs from back in the day, we didn't
care about the ash as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want black ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that would be like weirded
out maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like ash wasn't a qualifier
with the stuff we used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been smoking since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been rolling big joints since the
90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to hold that on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice looking ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice burning clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice drip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the it's got the ring for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can get the ring and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like smoking inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that outside, it's going to be more
peppery and less resiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, see why you're entering this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to go side to side and just
pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you do the talking on this one,
but I think the flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours definitely looks better and it's
it's chirpy, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to compare Z to Z.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's burning dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the funny part.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of turps though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's about the grind and the
tightness and all the things, too,
[SPEAKER_05]: is the trickier part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting concept, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, we need proper in them on the
on the show to actually have them tell you
[SPEAKER_05]: when and why, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, yeah, you didn't really
quite tight enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turps wise, they're both turpy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard strain to beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing is with the dirt skittles,
it's so fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Skittles is you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he pulls around between the fact
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with effect, Skittles is not normally
strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably when we smoke these two,
it's even going to get more high for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I get super high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get super high from mix light more than
I do from my own indoor of the same
[SPEAKER_05]: strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a lot higher from mix light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but I do get higher from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dirt is the first time I've got
skills in my entire life that was both
[SPEAKER_00]: strong and turpy, where it was like,
you know, it's like a candy because
[SPEAKER_00]: usually if I want it strong, I can go day
63.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I want to turpy, I want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want candy, day 51, day 52,
day 53.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know when that was harvested?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on day 53.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of right around the range,
I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: L.E.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: H.B.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: L.E.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: L.E.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the thing is, is like,
I think a lot of the OGs grown under L.E
[SPEAKER_00]: .D.
[SPEAKER_00]: are very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some lately and I'm just like
not that excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a handful of stuff that's like
CMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: H.H.B.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the L.E.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: OGs just don't cut it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's too intense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like with OG, I have some OG here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you almost got to put it on the
you got to put it on the edge of a grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in the back corner or you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't if you put that shit in the
center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to blow out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to lose turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's finicky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to ask for things that you
can't give it in the middle of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at OG wrong, it's not going to
be the best OG batch that you've had.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like I got this cut from Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian knows really good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He does.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went through the phenome with me to
hear that we just recently did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So G.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely OG, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost I don't even see OG like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that's why I wanted to give it
to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you're going to respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a lot of OG crosses and
there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not many people are growing like
original OG like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This definitely checks the boxes on the
white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a nice burning good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a good drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning even.
[SPEAKER_05]: Burning even.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got it's got the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're halfway down and it still
tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you know it's like the further
down it gets, if it still keeps tasting
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Collect the check.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put this one in, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you you definitely get critiqued
on just burn, but they they roll with
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands a chance against anything like
that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wouldn't get knocked for the I would
enter it, except for I think it would win
[SPEAKER_00]: on flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels it feels strong, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it has some good expansion for Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like those guys, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know it's I know it's coming out of a
clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an important piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's hard smoking stuff from other
people when you don't know what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: they did with who they got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer not doing that rather.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we mainly smoke our own weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty blessed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were QC and so much that it's like
really hard to get a hold of everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: else's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which but we do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to be sure that we're standing up
to the other people that are doing well
[SPEAKER_05]: and making noise.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's you know, that's the main reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like California, everybody like
sharing their stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're super inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there is exclusivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, but in the circle, it's like,
yeah, do you want like let's smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it's like a mandatory thing for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody likes sharing the weed,
sharing the batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can really tell a person by
their weed, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who walks around with weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of weed do they walk around
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, at least the forward facing
people that smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they have good weed on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually an obvious one for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are this was something from a hunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a Skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a mystery strain.
Also,
[SPEAKER_05]: permanent marker times candy fumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I read this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fino hunted it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like perm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some breeding with it with the grape
soda that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is because all this stuff is so
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's perm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some really cool purples with it,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one that was like a little bit
lighter on the perm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got permanent marker, double lemon,
cherry, purple marker, ZBX.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the snacks.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like a candy gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: My boy, first class things, candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about as candy as you're going to
get from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: First class genetics did a permanent
marker headband that we Fino hunted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that's that's my go to.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can get a hold of that, that's what I
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 707.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had the OG cut in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I learned the 707 is like sour
and OG where the Josh D was also renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was an OG cut a headband.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got some fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got real fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's with us in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This smells like straight up bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like if you get in there,
it's gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, dude, this is like more bubblegum
than the fake bubblegum stuff that was
[SPEAKER_00]: going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a strain bubblegum and
this is way more bubblegum than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the most medicinal strain we
have, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not even some of I would say this
is the best smelling thing I smelled this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only in January, but this is fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only in January.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to hold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm a big fan of cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you smell that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nice, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a new coffee machine.
We're going to have coffee machine in the
middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a nice coffee machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give it a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have coffee machine here in
the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really nice coffee machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it is a nice coffee machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coffee machine is a nice coffee
machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to give it a go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big on OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG is one of those ones when I get good
OG, just like, I mean, I've gone through
[SPEAKER_00]: the sour kick since I got, I got a
personal stash of sour, a nice big bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: it that I've been tapping into and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have that here?
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to test that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that at the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to get some for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to, it was in my shoulder
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I left that and I left my super
silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour has like disappeared from what I saw
is all kind of diet sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you don't see a lot
of good OG or sour anymore, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that Florida creepy cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupperwares.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we go to old school Tupperwares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my personal right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My turplocks are, I think they showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is our Marfino Hunter right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is S1 of the cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a, I have a big, huge jar from back
in the day that my friend gave me from a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that I gave him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I get that high?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like off the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off my own mic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, seriously, that stuff is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think just the combination of two
different varieties, but I think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make you come back this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this has potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, people have been, people have been
begging for some cookies, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, the cookies I've seen is all
just like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hard strain to grow now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've had, I had the thin man and it
was just like, honestly, it's a struggle
[SPEAKER_05]: in these types of facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like OG, you know,
I don't know if you got to, what you got
[SPEAKER_05]: to do with it, but it doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew like, I used to grow the most fire
cookies for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was like my thing when cookies
was popping, we had them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the big facilities, it's just not
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think low light level, low EC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just missing something.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you could get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just would take time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss cookies back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now it's back, but I missed it for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I've really seen
any good cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope you have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get that cut.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can definitely work something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, we got, I mean, we have other
phenos too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have one more question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were able to, to give your younger
self one piece of advice, what would that
[SPEAKER_00]: piece be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Work harder, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just what I'm like blue collar
work, fucking get it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So just that, just that alone,
it stands out for everyone, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like people are getting lazier and lazier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get back to the old way of working and
getting it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: The younger generation, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's insane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are interested in finding
more out about you, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Social super rough right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, our website is the spot to be
honest, so you can get ahold of us through
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My main social has been deleted for the
last two months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's probably gone forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might get it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: X is good for social, but you know,
I'm not as in tuned yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as soon as I get dialed in,
I should be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But our website, that's the best spot to
get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to touring your farm,
getting you some genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure some stuff out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please like and subscribe down below.
We'll see you next time.
