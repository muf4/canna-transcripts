[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to San Francisco, a city of
creativity, community and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we gather to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of the San Francisco Dabadoo,
[SPEAKER_00]: which first took place in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although Dabadoo began its journey in
2013, it was here in San Francisco that
[SPEAKER_00]: the event truly found its West Coast
spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What started as a small celebration has
since grown into one of the most respected
[SPEAKER_00]: gatherings in the cannabis community,
and this year, we honor a decade of
[SPEAKER_00]: passion, craftsmanship and connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the heart of this event is Mila
Janssen, the Hash Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is her story and the journey of
Dabadoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila Janssen has dedicated her life to
revolutionizing the way we make and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: From her days running Amsterdam's first
coffee house in the 1960s, to her
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations in cannabis extraction,
Mila has always been a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her creations, the pollinator and ISO
later made hash extraction accessible to
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts worldwide and cemented her
legacy as the Hash Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabadoo was born from Mila's vision to
bring the cannabis community together to
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrate the art of resonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It
[SPEAKER_02]: began as a birthday celebration,
but soon transformed into a global
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon, showcasing the best
traditional and modern extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just going to be a one-time affair
for my birthday and never again,
[SPEAKER_02]: but people liked it so much that four
months later we were in Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a few months after that, actually we
had our first Dabadoo right here in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco, and this is that 10-year
anniversary of that Dabadoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think since then we've had about 50
Dabadoos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We travel all over the place and have them
through Europe, and right after this,
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow actually I'll be flying to
Mexico, where we'll have a Dabadoo in
[SPEAKER_02]: Guadalajara, and then on to Costa Rica,
Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and finally
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia, and everywhere we'll be having a
Dabadoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one in Colombia will also have my 80th
birthday party, and that's my near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, Dabadoo honors 10 years of
innovation, friendship, and community.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, Dabadoo came to San Francisco for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first Dabadoo in San Francisco in
2014, I attended it, and it was a
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ed Rosenthal, I believe DJ Shore was
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a wonderful event.
[SPEAKER_05]: We came together in this passionate way in
such a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had heard about this concept that they
were doing the Dabadoos.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had went to one Dabadoo in Colorado,
and I had the opportunity to be a part of
[SPEAKER_07]: this amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I participated in setting up the Dabadoo
in 2014 with Nickatee Dougie for Hitman
[SPEAKER_07]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: That event was extremely special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a small, intimate gathering where
people were just starting to explore new
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities in cannabis resin
extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: The entries then were solvent and solvent
lists.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first press, and I forget that
guy's name, but he had the first rosin
[SPEAKER_05]: press going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: People lined up, and all they had was
buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't even doing little rosin bags
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all just buds, and the line was for
days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabadoo is about community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about hash, and it's a celebration of
Mila, and it's somebody we all love very
[SPEAKER_07]: much.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be a part of something so special,
that's why I feel like I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I live for those moments and those
experiences where I can be part of
[SPEAKER_07]: something so much bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila brought together a community of
enthusiasts who were eager to share their
[SPEAKER_00]: passion for hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere was electric, filled with a
sense of curiosity and camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marlon Asher was the entertainment.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Mila came into America at that point,
DJ had gotten her together with Spoiled
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, which is Spoiled Patients Collective,
who's one of the goats for separating
[SPEAKER_05]: lipids, fats, waxes, getting down to
distillate, Delta 9, Delta 8, along with
[SPEAKER_05]: holy water.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes back real far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabadoo has a special place in my heart
right now because I was in a room full of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: People who love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there was one person in that
room who didn't love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a kind of rare thing for our
community these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a really precious thing
that we had for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so seeing this community have a place,
really important function.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first event was a symbol of the
cultural shift happening within cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a move toward quality, craftsmanship,
and community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even then, it was clear that this
gathering was something special.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that first one in America was
something that was just extremely unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here it is back now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a great thing to see how far
she's come.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's over 50 to this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be a part of the 10 year
anniversary and to be here and to be doing
[SPEAKER_05]: this right now are just incredible to see
where it has come because it was so
[SPEAKER_05]: organic and like gray market at the time
and you know, almost a secret,
[SPEAKER_05]: like you had to call in, find out where it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you really couldn't put it on
the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was by herself at that time,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So her little crew wasn't with her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, to see where she's at with her
books and the class and the level of
[SPEAKER_05]: bouginess that's here now and the
professionalism and to see all the young
[SPEAKER_05]: folks because I'm an older dude at this
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: To see where it's went and how
professional and how clean everyone is is
[SPEAKER_05]: just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward to today and the essence of
Dabadoo remains the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone here is a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This inclusivity is what makes the event
truly unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Participants from all backgrounds come
together, united by their love for resin
[SPEAKER_00]: and the desire to celebrate the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I don't usually like all these cups and
competitions where you only have a few
[SPEAKER_02]: judges, I determined to have a hash
competition where everybody is a judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can respect everybody's knowing what
they like best.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get people from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got people flying in from Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got people from as far as Florida in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Humboldt County, L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a bunch of L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: entries.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is some amazing hash from Morocco
that somebody entered.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we have tons of really,
really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dabadoo is just so much more than
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like carrying on the legacy of Mila
being able to also celebrate her and give
[SPEAKER_06]: something back to the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've been to like four or five
Dabadoos.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to Barcelona a couple of times,
Colombia, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super excited to have everybody here and
to be helping Mila with this and to be
[SPEAKER_06]: kicking off her 2024 Dabadoo Tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a lot of great entries,
a lot of great hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's over a pound of hash being smoked
here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have 100 people to smoke a
pound of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the whole crew here, Focus V,
Rosentek, James, make a tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to smoke some good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more than enough hash to go
around, more than enough hash for
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody to try all the different amazing
entries.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have bubble hash, we have rosin,
and then we have traditional and temple
[SPEAKER_07]: balls.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those three categories are what we're
judging today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I'm just blessed to be a
part of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Dabadoo, the competition celebrates the
artistry of resin extraction with three
[SPEAKER_00]: categories that showcase the diversity and
craftsmanship in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a closer look at each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate is made using a
solventless extraction method that
[SPEAKER_00]: preserves the purity of the plant by
agitating cannabis plant material in ice
[SPEAKER_00]: cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes, tiny, resinous glands rich
in cannabinoids and terpenes are separated
[SPEAKER_00]: from the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once collected and carefully dried,
what's left is a high quality hash known
[SPEAKER_00]: for its potency and smoothness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up is rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another solventless concentrate,
rosin is created by applying heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure to cannabis flower, keaf,
or hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process results in a sticky,
resinous substance that's rich in both
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin has quickly become a favorite in the
concentrate world for its pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean flavor and high potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, there's the temple ball,
a traditional type of hand rolled hash
[SPEAKER_00]: known for its distinctive shape and silky
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made by pressing high quality trichomes
into a dense rounded form, temple balls
[SPEAKER_00]: have a rich terpene profile and are known
for their potent effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each entry is presented anonymously,
labeled only by a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ensures a focus on the quality of the
product rather than its origin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are getting ready to get all these out
to the people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing intake right now, last minute
intake, but we're numbering everything so
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's anonymous, so that people don't
know what's what necessarily.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of amazing entries,
three categories.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got rosin, we've got water hash,
and we have traditional slash temple
[SPEAKER_07]: balls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen them come in over the last month
and it's nothing but spectacular.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seeing the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I judged Cannifest 2024, there was
amazing stuff there too, but this is just
[SPEAKER_07]: really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Participants rate each entry across four
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell, look, taste, and effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I always feel that Adabadoo is
like a wine tastery.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get 20 bottles of good wine and you
get a bunch of people and you know they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of the same with Adabadoo
because everybody who comes there loves
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's competitors and some of those
entries are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same day, everybody has to try all the
entries and vote for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, we'll know who
the winners were.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are judging each entry on a scale of
one to five based on these different
[SPEAKER_07]: categories, look, taste, effect,
and smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going through each one of the
entries one by one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each judge will write down their favorite
first, second, and third place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we're going to tally it up at the end
and announce the winner at 9 p.m.
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: First comes the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each judge inhales deeply, exploring the
rich terpenes, those aromatic compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that make each sample unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The look is next, with judges examining
the color, texture, and consistency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden shine of a well-made rosin or
the rich dark tones of a classic hash tell
[SPEAKER_00]: their own stories of care and craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the taste, arguably the most
enjoyable part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each judge takes their time savoring the
flavors, whether it's floral, spicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: or earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect completes the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way each entry feels, whether it's
relaxing, uplifting, or somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: between, adds the final touch to the
score.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judging isn't just about finding a
winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a collective experience where people
share notes debate their favorites,
[SPEAKER_00]: and enjoy the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The true magic of Dabidu is the community
it creates, where cannabis enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: from different backgrounds come together
to celebrate their shared love of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila Jansson is at the center of it all,
smiling and interacting with attendees,
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing stories from her journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere is electric, with people
exchanging ideas, enjoying the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and remembering why they fell in love with
hashish in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Mila, Dabidu has always been about
more than just competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like about Dabidu most is that
nobody's looking at their phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's communicating, whether they're
from the same part of the world or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the night comes to a close,
the scores are tallied and the winners are
[SPEAKER_00]: announced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers erupt as the top three entries in
each category are celebrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these extractors, it's a recognition
of their dedication, craftsmanship,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the countless hours spent perfecting
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the prizes are just part of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real reward is being part of this
community, one that values craftsmanship,
[SPEAKER_00]: creativity, and connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at Dabidu, everyone is a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bound by the shared journey of exploring
and celebrating cannabis resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am just ecstatic right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything I feel like we've worked hard
for is on a table right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've really been pushing ourselves to
become one of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just feels good to come in here and
have that experience with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I respect a lot of the work on the
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: This right here wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for having it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really awesome to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we celebrate 10 years of Dabidu,
we also celebrate the incredible impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila Jansen.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Amsterdam's underground cannabis
culture to the global phenomenon that is
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabidu, her journey has been one of
passion, perseverance, and an unwavering
[SPEAKER_00]: love for Hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mila was doing it before anybody else was
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't just the best at what she did.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was the only person who did what she
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was and is a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's always had deep roots in the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's always been present, whether we are
in fashion or we were out of fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of transitions like that have
happened over the years, whether we are at
[SPEAKER_03]: the height of the drug war or whether we
were soaring on the success of
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila's legacy lives on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just in her innovations, but in the
community she has built.
[SPEAKER_07]: This event is really a celebration of one
person, and that's her legacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: This event is her legacy, and that's Mila.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we look to the future, Dabidu continues
to embody her vision and event where
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis lovers from all over the world
can come together, learn, and celebrate
[SPEAKER_00]: the art of resonance.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to present you with the
queen herself, Mila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been wonderful to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really enjoyed myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for everything that you've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stay high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's to 10 years of Dabidu and to many
more ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more than just an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a family, a movement, and a
celebration of the beauty of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the connections it fosters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
