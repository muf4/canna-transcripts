[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, our special guest is Thomas
from Grandmaster LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely feeling the weather on this
side of the bridge versus San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it warms up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally warms up over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so where are you from exactly?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm based out of Qualcomm Beach,
Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're basically as far west coast and
south as you can go in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much the nicest weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right across from Squam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, no, I absolutely love it out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been all over the mainland.
[SPEAKER_03]: But well, about I think about nine years
ago, I had like a really bad home invasion
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was just like, screw this man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm moving to the island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just I lived in this area in
Chilliwack, British Columbia, where there
[SPEAKER_03]: were just like people for a living were
just going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the home invasions were so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys were like pros too,
where they come and they drill a tiny hole
[SPEAKER_03]: through your, you know, to figure out
where you're at with like little bullet
[SPEAKER_03]: cameras and come back at the right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's straight Oakland style.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been happening in Oakland for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's gone, it's gone viral and
gone all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like pretty ruthless too and violent too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure that's like that here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear it's a bit of an issue too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Oakland now they'll just crash in
through the front door with a vehicle with
[SPEAKER_00]: a stolen car, stolen truck and going
through the front and freaking empty you
[SPEAKER_00]: out and do whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops don't come.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not much they can do in a lot
of instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the laws are kind of
against all of us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like anything less than $900 you
don't even get arrested for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, theft is, you know,
cited and released.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everybody's been warning me about
don't put anything in or just be so
[SPEAKER_03]: careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to be careful in San
Francisco and Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have anything in your
vehicle in plain sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, it's pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys allowed to conceal or you're
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have concealed, but it's not,
it's not very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's harder to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still possible, but yeah,
it's not, it's not a normal thing for most
[SPEAKER_00]: people to have concealed carries like
Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see that stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say if everybody's
packing, it's like, it's obviously got to
[SPEAKER_03]: change a lot of stuff, but it's like,
the wild West out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess with the value, um,
like in Canada, the price of cannabis has
[SPEAKER_03]: just gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've seen areas that you guys are
territory that you guys haven't seen yet
[SPEAKER_03]: because you guys still have red States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously they're still thriving
markets of people pushing stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're seeing the race to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I S I see stability happening too,
because we've just in California is 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went recreational, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had medical first before anybody in
1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then prop two 15 and then 2018,
we passed for recreational and a market
[SPEAKER_00]: that was completely unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a market that's unstable,
the thing is, is going from the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional market, the medical market,
which I feel was much more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had better product that was fresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was the first person to get
into the first people to get into the rec
[SPEAKER_00]: with the people that had the most money,
not the people with the best quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the people who understood quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes people scaled too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's on the shelves is shit
product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's slowly correcting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see good product on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I see good brands with good
product and their product is bad because
[SPEAKER_00]: it sits on the shelf for too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real problem in Canada going from
once it's finished to getting it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: shelves, like having the skew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you have to have it registered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some teams, it's only supposed to
only take a month or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen it take up to four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a product that doesn't have
it, it's like, you have to wait for this
[SPEAKER_03]: registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a lot of times that taking six
months have finished product to actually
[SPEAKER_03]: get it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I know some people like
doing a six month care, but not for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I like it when it's still sticky,
like it burns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is snapping, but sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, you know, and it has like a six
week window of when it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's only going to go downhill after that
six weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have products like turplock,
which help, you know, and storing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: cold temperatures help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but nothing beats a fresh sticky
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you get that sticky where
it's not like sticky from it being wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sticky from resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every stem will snap, but the whole half
pound sticks together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's my trademark for any half
pound that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost hard to roll joints with it,
but it rolls in a perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you've been trimming after
you've rolled one joint and your hands are
[SPEAKER_03]: all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where you can't even really use the
grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my style too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I am going to be smoking for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lighting company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been in the lighting business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with another company for four and a
half years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, I branched off on my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't kind of planned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of, I kind of got thrown out,
um, thrown out to dry basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was for the better or else
Grandmaster LEDs would have never started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's funny how that
works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the things that, that at the
time and the moment they seem like these
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible things and it ends up being a
blessing in disguise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd stayed my whole life anonymous
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been on YouTube for like years
making videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to remove hundreds of videos when
they were doing the purge, but I've always
[SPEAKER_03]: stayed anonymous until when I broke,
left that company, they doxed me on this
[SPEAKER_03]: roll it up for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now like I've been public ever since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're extremely public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's actually how we connected
was through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are very opinionated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like our friend Alex, uh, Miami mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you guys are professional is a
better, that's a great term, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like you guys speak your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not afraid to speak your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, the, the world needs
people like that, that are willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: argue and stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one of those people who likes to
argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just rather not argue about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put my content out there,
but I love the fact that you guys do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I could have probably taken my career
a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Further by just keeping my mouth shut and
saying hi to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if I saw something that doesn't,
that isn't right, keeping my mouth shut,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, for example, like just this week,
I bought another competitor's light
[SPEAKER_03]: because something didn't smell right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I, I sent it to light laboratory
in California here, and they're pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much the most reputable spear testing
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, all of a sudden I was
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the efficiency is lower than
what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, I, I post that kind of
stuff and I guess you could say expose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if I see another company just
misleading people in a really bad way,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say something even, you know,
and sometimes it is going to cost me
[SPEAKER_03]: customers, but at the same time,
I think for everybody, it costs me.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that respect that I'm
willing to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, it's growing at a really
fast rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think anybody that started at the
same time with us, it's probably out of
[SPEAKER_03]: business by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're every single month doing better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how it comes across to me is
authentic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm authentic in my own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you're doing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're authentic in your own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing wrong with exposing
people for bullshit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole industry, there's a lot of
bullshit that goes on within the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: within products, within testing and all
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they need to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many white papers have been faked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, uh, I really believe video
evidence is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's like when you can see it
firsthand, like so many times everything
[SPEAKER_03]: has been faked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, we've been led down these
wrong paths because of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, anytime where I see a study
that's been done in the later 2000s,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it doesn't have video with it or
pictures, I always have to question it
[SPEAKER_03]: because why couldn't you be snapping
pictures and showing what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: describing, but only putting it in words,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, um, well, just even with some of
the stuff we've done, we've discovered
[SPEAKER_03]: other people were faking their research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just such a big problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everything we do is for the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've been doing this my whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like even we've designed it when we
started, we've designed over 30 something
[SPEAKER_03]: lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the first year I learned some
really big lessons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was a big efficiency war.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, you know, I learned that,
um, diversity is more important than
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, um, so we, and same with
other things like discovering far red and
[SPEAKER_03]: having far red into your lights and seeing
the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we made lots of mistakes and had to,
you know, re-register and redesign
[SPEAKER_03]: everything to make it the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so like, I'm not afraid to make a
mistake and admit that I've done it and
[SPEAKER_03]: then correct it and kind of move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think those are the best ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you look at LED in the beginning,
it sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was something I said I'd never use,
but I've learned from experience that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to try that again,
because I feel like a lot of times we can
[SPEAKER_00]: dial stuff in and we can make it better
spectrum tuning, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we use science here and we
have spectrum tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, if you know what you're
doing, spectrum tuning can be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to be quite honest, science,
um, is what gave me the direction that I
[SPEAKER_03]: went with our company when it went in the
spectrum tuning, because they were the
[SPEAKER_03]: real first company that had the first
concept that had that diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just kind of took it to another level,
um, to be able to do stuff that their
[SPEAKER_03]: lights can't do and that, you know,
other lights can't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the biggest things with
HPS and LED that people don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like they want L HPS results
from an LED, but you know, the spectrum is
[SPEAKER_03]: so much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know a lot of people try to say,
oh, it's the radiant heat from it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I do not agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the temperature of the light is so
much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like the second, um,
we're seeing people that have been using,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've developed the very first HPS
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no other lights that can mimic
an HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like there's a lot of other companies
that have far red in their lights and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're usually like two to 3% at maximum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it double ended HPS have 10.4%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, ours have the ability to go up to
15% if you really want, like they have the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to, cause far red can be used to
stretch the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know it's a really rare situation,
but sometimes like you could have an area
[SPEAKER_03]: or a strain that you want to catch up with
the rest of the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can manipulate it to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some genetics work better when you
stretch them too, as far as like giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: more node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get chunkier buds that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having the ability to also limit the
stretch if you want to, by adding blue is
[SPEAKER_03]: such another huge thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing that our blue that we
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just kind of a wider blue
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most lights like science and you could say
almost 98% of companies have just a 450
[SPEAKER_03]: nanometer blue spike where we have a 450
and a 430.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get those from using the Samsung
evil mint diodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, you know, when I was testing
them up against each other, we did lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: side-by-sides, like two spikes versus one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see any type of difference
really, cause it's the same percentage of
[SPEAKER_03]: blue, but it just gives you the ability to
have more blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like any time when we're doing lots of
different side-by-sides, I've seen lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: tests where, like when we only had one to
2% difference, it's literally identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if there's a 2% difference in a
spectrum, you're not seeing anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you get up to 10 to 15% and all of a
sudden you can really see some crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: different expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have one piece of flower look like
it's from a different planet and it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also completely fluck your crop up
by using some, yeah, by tuning it
[SPEAKER_00]: incorrectly, by adding too much of this or
too much of that or playing around if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen that happen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm one of those tinkers where I like
messing around, but I got my buddy Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really worked with the science lights
and so he knows the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd listen to him instead of
playing around with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, this is totally screwed
things up or like, yeah, I worry about
[SPEAKER_03]: that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got a lot of people after buying
them cause we have like 60 preset
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrums you can choose from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, well, what do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to tell people, I don't even
actually pay attention to the different
[SPEAKER_03]: set spectrums.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of think as warm white,
almost as a HBS and cool white is a metal
[SPEAKER_03]: halide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can, you know, you can add
the other reds in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the biggest fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of companies have gone in this
direction where they have this big red
[SPEAKER_03]: spike it's 660 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 660 nanometer peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of companies use like over
double the amount that they should be
[SPEAKER_03]: using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's strictly to get a higher efficacy
number to like look more efficient on
[SPEAKER_03]: paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is when you add that
extra red, it actually suppresses green.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at HBS, like a double ended
HBS, it roughly has about almost,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like around 58% red.
[SPEAKER_03]: And around like 38% green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the rest of the things like four
to 5% blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't have nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think it's just the wrong route.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you look at an actual double ended
HBS, you'll see that like it goes from 600
[SPEAKER_03]: to about 630 is where you see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, that doesn't even really have
any 660.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't, it's just at the very
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I, I've just seen people having
better results with the fuller spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a crop where I did three different
spectrums with a cut, where I've got over
[SPEAKER_03]: a hundred runs in with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called death Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has seen my death Bubba videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I still got three different
results, like one of the buds was almost
[SPEAKER_03]: like 15 to 20% bigger, different trichome
density, different bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, as soon as I saw that,
I'm like, this is the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% like everything we're doing moving
forward is spectrum tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just take it to a different level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you can tune in your room,
the better, you know, and it's then you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get really specific with genetics and
you're like, okay, well, this variety
[SPEAKER_00]: grows well under this spectrum and this
one under this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's like, that's the future,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, having that test room with the four
lights at bare minimum too, but we we're
[SPEAKER_03]: working with this company in Missouri that
they have a test room with four different
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put curtains in between it and they
make it like totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, they're really seeing a big
competitive edge because whichever one
[SPEAKER_03]: does the best, then they implement that as
their base spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they can also use it like with
adding blues and different stuff to
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulate it, but no whip based spectrum,
it's going to work the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people have one spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're like, you know, it's such a
competitive edge to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as a breeder now coming in,
now you're breeding these things and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting to understand how the
spectrum works with the genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right out the gate, you can kind
of get a good understanding of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work well with what.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially for your own crew or like
coming up with your own proprietary light
[SPEAKER_03]: recipes that you can license out for those
different genetics, because like what's
[SPEAKER_03]: when everybody's using the same spectrum
and the same genetics and the same food,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like you really need to give your
something that's that make it different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The direction the world is going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like right when you think they
figured it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't even the tip of the iceberg
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like there's so much
more, you know, with nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: with everything else and everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of companies that make
good product as far as nutrition is
concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like we're still dialing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dialing in yields, under canopy,
inner canopy, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've been working on where we're
probably about a month from releasing
[SPEAKER_03]: their under canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We we ran into a little hiccup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had everything ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I well, ours isn't just under
canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lower side lighting to an upper side
if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I didn't I overlooked is the
different distance and trellis bars
[SPEAKER_03]: between different tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because, you know, there there can be
anywhere from four feet, five feet,
[SPEAKER_03]: six feet or even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had to come up with a way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to come up with a way to make the
lights mount to those bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like same with our under canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of they float.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't sit on different structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have a utility patent for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited for all this under
canopy and inner canopy and side lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, some of these guys
are like, oh, you don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the proper light at the proper
distance, you're going to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have yet to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working with Favin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some Favin trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm excited for the stuff that
we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the potential is so huge for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make seeds, you're doing seed
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you get so much more underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all those all those white yellow
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those now even think of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're actually I'm actually trying
my seed production room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be able to tell you whether
it's the under canopy, the light lift or
[SPEAKER_00]: the combination of the light lift with the
under canopy that yields the most seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very confident that one of those,
if not all of them are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah, it's going to play a huge
factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just having like, I really recommend
people if they can to build a light
[SPEAKER_03]: lifting system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even have a DIY video that shows how to
do it with pulleys and using a winch
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't don't want to buy like,
I know ThinkGrow LED has an option for
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a few different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a horizon light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, ThinkGrow has a cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the horizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even going back for my whole commercial
growing career, going back to almost the
[SPEAKER_03]: earliest days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, after like about 2004, we would
always have like, I'd build it on a crank
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can always lift like I was I was
never a double ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a single ended HPS guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate yo-yos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely hate yo-yos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went from that and then like I went and
got into LED lighting and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so yeah, my experience like I didn't ever
get like the most to be quite honest that
[SPEAKER_03]: I ever yielded on a single ended HPS was
2.85 pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with a crush strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still really, really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did many times between 2.5 and 2.65 and
you know, went for half a decade over
[SPEAKER_03]: averaging over two when that was way above
the average back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like breaking two was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5 was the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you guys know, back in the day,
if you hit 1.5, you know, 15 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were, you were killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Sour and Blue Dream, they would
get around two, maybe 2.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the first time I hit 2.2 was with
Sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever grow juicy fruit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were, I was growing juicy fruit
from like about 98 to about 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that majority of it all came to
here too.
It did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the juicy fruit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a popular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was the really good stuff that
came from Canada, I believe was juicy
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a lot of the Beasters that
weren't so great that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like they were all footballs,
football pounds that were like that big
[SPEAKER_00]: where they had smashed them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they ran a three to kill the
smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just so many, so much crazy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we used to see, but yeah,
it was such a popular one for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys ever had the old
school hash plant that was like from the
[SPEAKER_03]: 90s to the early 2000 that's gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we've had some hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a couple of different varieties
of hash plant coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some, like AFQ was also a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this would have been, I don't like,
I would have made it at some point,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it would have been in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't have been that popular,
but it was like a biker strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like then it was, it was just a super
killer strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been searching for it forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just to get it back and with no luck
tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, people have given it to said,
Hey, I've got a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Been holding onto it for two decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time I grow it, it's not even
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that that's the same thing
with cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that say they have
cat piss, but it's like, it's not the cat
[SPEAKER_00]: piss that I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure remember a lot of cat piss strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also, there was a strain called master
Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like, I don't even know if that's
what the real name strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to monitor it with death bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the highest THCV that we'd ever
seen by far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that got almost 7%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just under 7%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more than anything we'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew it up until the point where death
bubba was yielding more for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was getting the same money for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I dropped it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got it years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: About four years ago, guy gives me four
cuts and says, this is it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well out of the four cuts, one of them was
the real cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was a cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was like this other PK
strain that I absolutely hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after I got it, grew it out,
I somehow managed to mark it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, or somehow like the person I was
working with didn't mark it correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't me personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to grow out again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the next crop, as soon as it
was done, somehow my buddy must have,
[SPEAKER_03]: while he was walking out of the room,
swapped the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I threw out like, this is after I lost
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, the other one was a cross of it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, sit like it grew small buds
and had the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so I threw it out,
sent it to like five different people
[SPEAKER_03]: across Canada to like secure it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they started growing it out and the
strain didn't like light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it couldn't take very much light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden I was like,
I just couldn't believe that I got it back
[SPEAKER_03]: and then threw it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never will I let some, I'll let someone
else deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll deal with it myself or trust someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost so many different things that I
really loved over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's been so many great
things that we didn't have tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have big places to keep our
stuff alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we shared it with the wrong person and
they lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I used to bring stuff up to
Washington just so they could secure it
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could go back at any, I lost
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like maybe six times and had to get to
Washington six different times to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the chem, we had the chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's such a popular strain on the East
coast, on the Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all grown here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, like everybody, I always hear
people on the East coast talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: what people from New York just freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was top, you know, $6,000 a pound
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top, top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is like, again,
with sour, it's like, I have not seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: most amazing sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it used to be on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to see a lot of good sour where
it, you open the bag, it punches you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, you know, and the buds were so
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the outdoor was nuts too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the outdoor was just as good as the
indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your guys' outdoor market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's well, like it's so different than how
ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't have an outdoor market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not saying that people didn't
grow, but it never affected our markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was so crazy for, I'm going to say up
until potentially 2014, I would watch
[SPEAKER_03]: every single year at the end of August,
September, the prices of indoor would
[SPEAKER_03]: skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened for, I watched it for about 15
years in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, I remember talking to my
buddy just a few years before the 15
[SPEAKER_03]: years, but like, Hey man, you could just
make a career buying stuff at cheap and
[SPEAKER_03]: selling it, you know, months later when
it's that careers and retirements have
[SPEAKER_00]: been made on that for sure out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have the, if you have the
funds, the capital to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's been people throughout the
last 20 years that brokers that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even grow it, they can go buy for dirt
cheap, hold onto it for four months,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in some cold storage, and then
unload it for two, three, four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: times as much as they paid for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first year that I tried it,
mine 50 pounds was the first year there
[SPEAKER_03]: was a gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the market where we get uncharted
territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think I had gotten it for like 17
and you know, at 24 was the peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're used to, we were used to seeing
at least go up to 28 to 29 every single
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it went down to 24.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I still did all right
with it, but I, it was the very first
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, we got an uncharted
territory ever since that point on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, we've just seen, well,
like for our outdoor, it's just so
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have like that outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, I've in my whole life,
I've ever seen anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen it flooded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen it flooded with outdoor
packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no one's interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that doesn't, we're like a hub where
everything is going out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: From all over the place though.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now Canada is exporting all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got like a good friend of mine that
exports about three to 5,000 pounds a
[SPEAKER_03]: month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, he's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in like 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the first person to export to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why they're exporting,
but one of my, a guy that I dealt with for
[SPEAKER_03]: years, set up a chain of dispensaries
across there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called the Kana clinics, but,
but yeah, it's just insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think there's still people that do
it on the black market that bring it to
[SPEAKER_03]: the States just because of the gap in our
pricing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it sounds crazy, but there's people
that will take it from the West coast that
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it to the East coast and going
across to the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, well, like right now,
like if, you know, you can get really nice
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff for like say 500 Canadian a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably wouldn't even recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think when I think of Canadian,
I think of this super dense stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, doesn't have, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably if it comes down here,
they don't call it Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't have a clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised on like just how
horrible our market is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can remember a while ago,
a couple of years ago, one of my buddies
[SPEAKER_03]: was bugging me like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I know you can help me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I phoned a store for him to try to,
I'm like, can you, can you get him some
[SPEAKER_03]: picks?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I happened to be in town and like,
I'm, I'm not involved in anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, but I was, I happened to go by the
store and I saw these were the nicest
[SPEAKER_03]: picks I've ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not one small piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm talking, they were absolutely
fricking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've never in my life seen eight
picks that were just spectacular like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they want in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they said it was going for like
800 Canadian and they didn't even want to
[SPEAKER_03]: come down and look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is wrong with you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen that in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've seen a lot of packs and never
seen anything even close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are big into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got some friends from Canada and
they, they have amazing rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are producing amazing rosin
and extract up there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, well, you know, um, BC bubble,
man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on our team.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, he's, uh, he's got the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always had the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, I was just going to say,
he kind of wrote the rules, wrote the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules for the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friends with Dave from Gastown.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Vancouver Island also too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's got the killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, he knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's in a really nice area in Tofino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to come back up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you allowed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got kicked out of Canada for a joint
riding across the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had a joint in the car,
but it was in a tackle box and they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to search the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so upset that they were
searching the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked shit because I didn't think there
was anything in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the whole time the guy searched and
I'm like, you find anything, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's like, no, we're going to
find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, there was a tackle box in
the trunk that had like a four year old
[SPEAKER_00]: joint that had a little bend to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulls it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we got them guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had paperwork in my back
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I have a recommendation from
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're going across international
borders with drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, not I'm, that's a joint and
it's, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the funny thing, but I did have a
script on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ended up having to pay a $550
fine and got kicked out of the country for
[SPEAKER_00]: five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: When was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seven, maybe six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got a felony, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he goes across.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems to be okay doing going over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're, you know, they're going
to let you like, if you broke somebody's
[SPEAKER_03]: face with their legs, I think there,
you have a better chance of getting across
[SPEAKER_03]: than if you're selling or got caught with
like a trafficking charger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, like something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just hate that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm sure stolen property too,
probably doesn't go over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't fly very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But DUIs, I think if you have a DUI,
you can't even get in Canada for the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's especially, I don't know how
they, well, 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they have a 24 hour here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a step down from a DUI or is
there, is it only DUI?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only DUI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For us, you can get like a 24 hour where
it's like, uh, you just lose your license
[SPEAKER_03]: for 24 hours and you get it back or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I, you know, I've got,
I've got them for bullshit when I wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: even on anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only shitty thing about it is I
can't dispute it or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like for weed, like it's happened to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember going for a drive to pick
something up from the store and like my
[SPEAKER_03]: ride smelling like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got taken down and I'm arrested for
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember like, I was just picking
something up from the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife is like, where are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, so yeah, it's pretty crazy.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, they do need that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's, you know, a DUI, I guess it's
pretty serious charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can, well, it's big money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the end of the day, they're not
going to change it because they like the
[SPEAKER_00]: money that they get from the DUIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, you know, and it 0.08 is the
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so you are allowed some, you can have
up to 0.08 in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anything over that you go to,
you pretty much go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty sure Canada, it's zero tolerance
now at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero tolerance for driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it's like, you're not
allowed anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are drinkers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the Canadians are actually
drinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bubble is not really a drinker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not a bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't, like I, when I drink,
I'm not a quitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I drink, but like I only maybe
have drinks maybe one or two times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, not a very, do you ever see the
movie strange brew?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ringing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the name sounds familiar,
but it's not ringing a bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like my first experience to
Canadians in beer, but it was so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember the, the a, they said a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I spent my twenties doing a lot of
drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of club scene and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've got three daughters now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prefer edibles and cannabis over drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the edibles is actually nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not big on the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, edibles just don't sit well with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing is, is like,
I'll do the, the micro dose weed edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll do like two mic or two,
two a milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then I'll, yeah,
I do the mushrooms too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the mushroom micro doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like mushrooms, I can handle more
than I can handle edibles for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, but I can smoke a big fat joint
and be totally happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a tolerance,
like even for me, I just quit for a while
[SPEAKER_03]: and then took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I was getting way too
fucking high, like uncomfortably high,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where I can't go out and do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can smoke and then go to work or go
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're like my heart, my breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've given them to these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've given them to a few people where they
phone straight up 9-1-1 and got an
[SPEAKER_03]: ambulance there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they think they're having a heart
attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one guy I gave it to, like,
I have these gel capsules are like 350
[SPEAKER_03]: milligram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave one to him and I took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He fell asleep, woke up, forgot he took
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just thinks something was going
on with his heart paramedics and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything come down there and they're
like fucking drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've seen a few people where this
happens to, if you take too much,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just not fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've curled up in the bed before I
wanted to go to the hospital for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, well here, so in rec,
you're limited to 10 milligram doses and a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred milligrams per package.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been buying them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been eating like a few hundred at
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why it's better than Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in Canada, we have five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never even truly been in a legal
dispensary in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, I personally, it's just not my
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'd be nothing for me to, there and
well, first of all, the edibles are just
[SPEAKER_03]: like baby, baby doses too, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally five milligrams, but you gotta eat
a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't like having to suck on a
bunch of sugar, eat a bunch of sugar
[SPEAKER_03]: either if I'm going to like once in a
while, but I don't want to be a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: sugar every single night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always have them in gel caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to go for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: MCT oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like making like high end rosin that
people would be smoking and using it for
[SPEAKER_03]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think rosin is the best for edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I normally was making it from
flour and just recently, like I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I'm just getting into water hash cause
a bubble man and like I'm making it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a man, the difference in potency is so
it's so much different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like same milligram, but it's way more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, so I like the, the gummies that
are made from rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like anything that's made from rosin,
like I, for whatever reason, I would
[SPEAKER_03]: always notice that when you have edibles
that were made from VHO after I would,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get like these nasty burps totally
from like the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and you know, when people are making
distillate that stuff, there's like some
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty stinky stuff that comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the crude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what they call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy nicknamed it the fish stuff,
but that's gross stuff is like a wet your
[SPEAKER_03]: burp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that you're burping that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's hot dog water.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I, when I take it from rosin,
I don't have those burps at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, um, it filters that out when
from the heat or whatever the lipids or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, the fats aren't in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the hot dog water in the
carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, I liked, I liked the rosin
gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin tech makes these amazing ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the flavors, but they had
some, like, I feel like you get the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the taste of the rosin is also good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the turps and it's complimentary a
lot of times, especially with sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was noticing like it's the pricing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on, well, the stuff for 20 bucks for
a hundred milligrams really tastes really
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: High-end gummies, those stuff for $10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that bad, but you can definitely
taste, taste the difference and that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking in my head, Oh, why did I buy the
cheap shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I, well, first of all, I don't want any
cheap shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason why they're selling it
fucking so cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like, I, I know that you guys are,
it's, I think it's from what my
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding is like the wild west for
your guys is dispensary, like pesticide
[SPEAKER_03]: testing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in Canada, it's so like everything is
tested so thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way you're walking into a
dispensary and getting stuff with
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say here it's the same way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some people that have
circumvented and cheated, didn't got gone
[SPEAKER_00]: around it, but like in the dispensaries in
California, I can't speak for every state,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would say that it's pretty heavily
tested and they're coming down on the labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, you know, Oh really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like, I, I kind of thought it was
still kind of like the wild west with the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries, like up until like Canada,
there used to be like in downtown
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver, like over a hundred like black
market dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were accepted by the police that are
paying, you know, licenses, but then every
[SPEAKER_03]: single one got wiped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they were completely gone and there's
no more black market dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only legal dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like New York has the bodegas,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you can do in New York,
but California doesn't have the bodega
[SPEAKER_00]: model really, but we have THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so THCA, you can find that in gas,
gas stations, liquor stores, CBD shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's THCA flower that's grown under
hemp license.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, so these guys are,
there's just loophole right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get sealed up, but I've been
hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't fully understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, cause like, I remember I was
speaking to this guy in Colorado that was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, he was so happy because he was
allowed to like sell THCA now to some
[SPEAKER_03]: other state.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, my bank just accepted me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he was all excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I guess that's, well, I already know
it's an issue here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, like I'm with chase and I have,
I had an issue like when we got paid by a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis company, like I, we can't even be
paid by from chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chase is the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even have an account there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they blocked me for having an
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like in cannabis, like chase's
chase is not cool with any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA is considered hemp under the farm
bill that was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls under the category, unless it's
converted to a Delta nine, then that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be considered THC, but it has to be above
0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have Delta nine at 0.2% and
it could have 27% THCA and it's considered
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and you smoke it, it still gets you
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still that same plant, but it's,
it's, it's categorized differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in an interesting, I mean,
you know, this is an interesting day in
[SPEAKER_00]: time that's evolving and it's not going to
stay this way forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think though, like with all the
red States, like it's gotta be so
[SPEAKER_03]: thriving.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gotta be so many people just
crushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THCA people are people that are
selling you working under the hemp are
[SPEAKER_00]: crushing it in Texas is Texas isn't legal
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not, it's not recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows if it'll ever pass recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd hope it would someday, but it's not
right now, but THCA is in all the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have jars, you know, and they have
jars from all Oregon and from wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find your popular brands and
all of it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go online though, you can go
online and you can type in THCA and your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite company cookies is selling there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even cookies has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a pretty big Instagram
following.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us about Instagram and your
history with social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been on YouTube for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was on, I had hundreds of videos on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, at any given time, I would be
documenting anywhere from like two to six
[SPEAKER_03]: to seven operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I was a commercial, well,
commercial size medical grows for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time, like for about 15 years where I
would have anywhere from, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 150 to 500 lights going really depending
on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to, yeah, I used to make like,
um, and some weeks I would put out 10
[SPEAKER_03]: videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I literally did it besides the
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost full time where I'm like,
I'd have crops where I would have over 50
[SPEAKER_03]: videos out just for one crop where each
video is anywhere from, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: five to 20 minutes where I'm covering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every last part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, you know, I, it was like a passion
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, and I helped a lot of different
people all over the world with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they had this YouTube purge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you ever remember about it
where it's like all of a sudden YouTube
[SPEAKER_03]: channels, half of everybody I knew was
taken out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point we were like,
I, I removed like I had over 700 grow
[SPEAKER_03]: videos and like a couple hundred live
streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I removed everything and I opened up a
zoom account and we started taking
[SPEAKER_03]: everything to zoom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have like at one point it was
like a 500 to 600 person live audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had built up every single week.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as we went to zoom, we were down
to like 200.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that for like about a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I felt it YouTube, like some
channels were coming back and the tide was
[SPEAKER_03]: changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just felt like I came back to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, obviously the algorithms
changed like it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it keeps changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the one thing now that's the
constant is that it's going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never catch up to it because it's
constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so complicated and they use so many
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data points, uh, that they're,
they're pulling from, and there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifications for videos and they use AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a weed leaf on your shirt,
you're not going to get subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get viewers on,
on any of the platforms, except for maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter's been more open about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Twitter doesn't have the same for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter doesn't have the same results as
Instagram or YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at one point, if you had a title,
whoever had the moment, most views and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the same title came to the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, X is supposed to be like that,
but I'm just a nobody on X.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't, I'm trying to give away a
light to get over a thousand followers and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I haven't been plugging it every day,
but it's like, it's so hard to get to that
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm sure if I had 20,000 people,
I could totally grow from that point on,
[SPEAKER_03]: but because I'm being seen by so little,
it's like, it's the same thing for like
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube, like try to start a YouTube
channel from scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And try to make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would need a big break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I mean, we, we grew, we have now
12,000 subscribers and I feel like Ricky
[SPEAKER_00]: Palamino when he was talking about Snoop
Dogg, it went viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those are the, when you're
talking about celebrities or popular
[SPEAKER_00]: things, popular search topics,
those, you know, we got 6 million views on
[SPEAKER_00]: one short on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kept growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, is it going to stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, Ryan, is it going to stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's going to stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we went on for eight weeks
and it just kept growing and growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, one of the strategies for us was
like cross, cross, crossing traffic with
[SPEAKER_03]: other people and, you know, doing
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're actually, do you know who
Merculeez is?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's with death row records.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually performing for Snoop Dogg
right now on their tour that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing a collaboration with him
and we're making Mercs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're making some really pimp ass
glasses that are going to come with our
[SPEAKER_03]: lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's also going to be selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best spectrum for LED glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best color?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing is like,
there's some companies that make them that
[SPEAKER_03]: claim protection, but I'll tell you,
you can put it on and it's like blinding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have already have our own glasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you put them on, it's like a green
color, but it gives you almost,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say 99% protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can turn the lights at full power
and look at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have like actual protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only issue is it's like a green color.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after about five minutes, it adjusts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your eyes do adjust.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a few different
lenses, but we're definitely going to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: on working on it until we have something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like we haven't finished our lens,
but we've just finished the design of the
[SPEAKER_03]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you need a tunable glasses that
can tune to the different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto tune on the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just push a button and it tunes with
the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: The eye protection, I think it's something
that's overlooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh man, your eyes can, like after
working in there or trying to work in far
[SPEAKER_03]: red, or like too much, it's so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, just like when you walk out of a
room after you've doing it, like you're so
[SPEAKER_03]: blinded too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's like, it's something for
the, it's something people should be
[SPEAKER_03]: paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, these are the types of
things I think about for employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't, I don't, it's not even the
liability aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more so that their health and their
eye health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my eyes have gotten worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second I was fine, everyone's like
when you turn 40 and the truth is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is when I turned 43 is when my eyes got
fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 47 now, but like my eyes went to where
I needed bifocals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get bifocals, but now I have two
different lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have one more concentrated that's,
that's for distance and then one that's
[SPEAKER_00]: for a near sighted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, I've had really good eye vision,
but I like my whole life and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I kind of feel like they've taken a
toll from the years of the lighting and
[SPEAKER_03]: every like being around it like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're in a beautiful time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lens surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where they can pull the lens off your
eye and put a new lens on and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: give you better than 2020 vision,
as long as your vision is stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into talking about genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know you're a big genetics guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love cannabis, at least from what I
get to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be quite honest, like I, I'm all the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Majority of the stuff I have is really old
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like old school OG lineage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a big problem in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's as bad in the United
States with just rename.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and like so much stuff just is the
worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just like in BC alone, like when purple
Kush hit, it just, there must've been a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred different names for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, it's a big, big problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had this strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite a funny story.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you even Google it, it will lead you
down the wrong path called death Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the, the death Bubba name came
from us getting it into a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, and it was just an accident,
like everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like growing up in the nineties,
we'd call like, if it was something was
[SPEAKER_03]: really good, we'd describe it as the
death.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the kills.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the death.
[SPEAKER_03]: That killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then like, um, after PK,
like different types of Bubba started
[SPEAKER_03]: coming on the scene and they started
becoming really popular, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and uh, like I, we, how the name
actually happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a buddy of mine took it to this
dispensary Eden in Vancouver, and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the biggest chains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember just saying to him,
just show it to him, get him to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the death.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the death man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like my buddy's like,
it's death.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like, somehow he said it's death
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how the, how the name got
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's, what's kind of funny is I
dealt with a lot of people, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with the main guy and the main guy
just, I got put in touch with him by
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble man, just like a couple of weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I have to ask you about this because
he was the person in charge of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, they, they absolutely loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was their number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seller for until we stopped giving it to
them and same with the MK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got so popular that other dispensaries
just started copying the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there'd be lineups outside the door
for people to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would just rename it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's such BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MK ultra was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the two strains we had death
Bubba and MK, but they decided just to
[SPEAKER_03]: call it MKU.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Eden made this decision to call
it MKU.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we never said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just called it MK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And um, then everybody just copied it in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there is a really good MKU strain,
but it's, it's nothing like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the master Kush that I was growing or
even related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MKU is MK ultra.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people just started stealing the
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because like the strain became so
popular, there was another really good MKU
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, unless you're from like the
early two thousands and you bought that
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff, most people don't know the
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like MKU is like a really popular
strain that a lot of people die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard grow and like it, which in my opinion
is more like the Bubba strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there were all these different Bubba
strains that I felt were somewhat related,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though they had different flavors,
but like they all had OG in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soapy OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I love Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I think, uh, Bubba got
bastardized in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened is it became the
commercial strain because you could
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest in 54 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Asian community blew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, blew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: No tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before Runts and before LCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubbas were the big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew up with a different Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with master Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a master Kush that would,
it would branch out laterally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd get lateral, uh, so the Brax
would grow sideways, almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the buds, they were ugly looking or
weird looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say ugly, but they were almost
like Charlie Brown Christmas tree looking
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the Bubba and the Bubba
was like this soapy, smelled like Irish
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs, OG, gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them were extremely gassy,
extremely pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were for me, those were the
exotics of my day back in the 90s and
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, one thing about the two that I,
um, really big difference that I would
[SPEAKER_03]: notice like that Bubba and Bubbas could go
purple and lighter color with yellow
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves where that the master Kush strain
that we had no purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes completely get only yellow,
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lime green somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no purple at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, um, the death bubble was also
a lot more forgiving of a strain where you
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you make a little mistake or feed it
too much food.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could kind of recover and go a little
bit longer master Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you give it too much food or do
anything or you lock it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just shuts down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my experience too,
with OG Kush back in the day was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a finicky strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was totally worth it, but I never got
really big yields with OG, but it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: the best smoke ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone wanted me to grow it,
but I didn't want to grow it because the
[SPEAKER_00]: yields were so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I grew it for myself for
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew that for myself for smoke back in
the day, but it wasn't like the big
[SPEAKER_00]: producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew a combination of different,
I always like having different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also liked mastering flavors and
mastering growing one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've tried multiple breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like anybody that ever got the death Bubba
could never get it to produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like before different people attempted it
and they'd get pollen sacks, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: but no one ever got any pollen out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm still SFV is like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think SFV, uh, Mac one is a
partial triploid, like a natural partial
[SPEAKER_00]: triploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what I think it might be
naturally or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be interested to see someone cross it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens when you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make some pollen, see if you can
reverse it even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if even if you can't reverse it,
you could still cross it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can still, you can still pollinate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing I like about it is the stability
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, like it would was really weird
as I would get over the 20 years of
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I could get it to produce seeds,
but only like a few, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: my cousin, he could barely fit through the
aisle of the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember when he's walking through
the plants are like shaking like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that say out of 40 pounds,
well, we might've got 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, found 30 seeds throughout
the crop, all fully mature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on one of them, I remember,
um, sprouting them and they were literally
[SPEAKER_03]: at the females were identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there, you couldn't tell the
difference, but I didn't, back then we
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have like, I wasn't COAs getting
them tested, but like, I didn't even keep
[SPEAKER_03]: them cause they just looked identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of regret not it, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's when you have stable
genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, that's a good sign of
stability when the seeds come out exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: like the parent, but like I've never seen
any type of male flower or anything on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so it must be internally that it
does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it pollinates itself, like for it to
produce the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a survival mechanism that the
plants have and typically a plant or if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're under any sort of stress will
produce a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's only one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, even the most stable varieties
will produce a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it like, you know, almost every other
crop I would also see like, and this is,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can remember it for 10 years,
like out of nowhere, you'd see like this
[SPEAKER_03]: weird growth coming out of it,
like where you'd be six weeks in flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then you all of a sudden, like a lower
branch would have this like three week old
[SPEAKER_03]: growth, kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would always cut it out and not,
but I never, ever see it just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it clearly always stuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause hey, why is it doing that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it also, another cool thing
about the strain is it will have round
[SPEAKER_03]: tops and pointy tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, for whatever reason,
like lately it's just all pointy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like on the last person I saw grow it,
we were seeing a bunch of round tops
[SPEAKER_03]: again, and I can't explain why it does
that light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably light spectrum, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's environmental,
but I'm saying even in like the same room,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in the same room on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the same room, with multiple
plants, like you'll see some that are
[SPEAKER_03]: pointy and then some are around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like under the same spectrum, you can get
different results.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I saw it for a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, all my crops are,
I've got two under LED with death Bubba
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've got probably like a hundred plus
under HBS with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just like, I mono cropped it
because for a decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people love it though, you never get
sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the true sign that it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too is when people never get sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never get sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like something like green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved growing green crack and then I
would smoke it and it would be cool for
[SPEAKER_00]: like the first couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even the first couple of weeks,
like it gets you really high the first
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days, and then you build a
tolerance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a couple of weeks,
you're like, nah, I don't want to ever
[SPEAKER_00]: grow this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might grow it again a couple of
years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've definitely grown it before too and
feel the same way about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrous oxide and beef jerky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I get on the nose with that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't actually make that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else wrote that, but I was like,
and you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like nitrous oxide and beef
jerky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but yeah, that's the one where
it's like in the beginning, it gets you
[SPEAKER_00]: super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time you're building a
tolerance to it, you start sharing with
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, why are you guys fucking so
high?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These days I like to just obviously
selection is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like having so many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff to pick from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I like, like, you know, I like six
star hash or like really high end rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: and like having a bunch of different
flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I like about it is, um,
being able to have it, put it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: freezer and six months later, it's still
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, you can't beat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's like, I do that with
flour too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like flour, I can come out a
year later and it's still just by just
[SPEAKER_03]: sticking it in the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cure it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you dry it, you cure it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put it in a sandwich bag
loosely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you vacuum seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the freezer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want a stable freezer that doesn't
have ice or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you label and date it and you're good
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the first person that ever showed me
that was a guy named Ben from IC
[SPEAKER_00]: collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's like game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked stuff that was two and a half
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty fucking amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, so that, that's kind of one of
the biggest things why I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like also with water hash too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making everything fresh, which I like,
I'm about to start doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just liked the idea that you're getting
every last bit of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how much are you losing when you're
harvesting and like in trimming and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's a fair number?
[SPEAKER_03]: 25% by the time everything is shaken and
everything is moving versus if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: washing it and it, or if it's going right
into the freezer frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just smoked some bubble house that was
like four years old in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm moving and bringing it tasted
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's, that's exactly like,
I have a little, six light medical where I
[SPEAKER_03]: can also test, um, different, you know,
lighting and use it for R and D,
[SPEAKER_03]: but my, I've been growing three strains,
but I plan on doing it to like six strains
[SPEAKER_03]: so that I can, you know, have six flavors,
wash them and then have just keep on
[SPEAKER_03]: storing them in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like after a few years, I'm going to
have it just a shit load of flavors for
[SPEAKER_03]: when people come over.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Varieties always nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just having that selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also just for if you're doing edibles
or everything, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all have different effects too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so I'm big on the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like more recently, it's my buddy,
Dave has passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been thinking a lot about
what's important at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect and the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but there's the, I kind of went
away from putting an emphasis on effect
[SPEAKER_00]: and was so heavily focused on flavor for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a chef, also get excited about
flavors and excited about effect too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I like the effect of cannabis in
general, but like there are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars and certain varieties that you
smoke that are like, wow, I feel fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: great or wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking awake first thing in the
morning or wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking I can go to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to just have those when you
want them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of nice or even the combination
of combining them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, I don't like necessarily like
I, cause I use it to sleep and I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: have serious insomnia without,
but at the same time, it's like your
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance just gets so strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, take like every now and
again, I like to take like a full month
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hard for me to do getting
through the first week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I literally, when I quit edibles,
like, and after I built my tolerance,
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally withdraw like my body
physically addicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need it to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I go through hell for about a
week, but after that week, and then like
[SPEAKER_03]: on the 30 day mark, it's just like,
you get so high when you try smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: something or like first edibles is almost
too strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go so light afterwards,
but it's just kind of nice to have that
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance break and really feel that feel
what it can do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I, I have a tough time with
tolerance breaks, like real tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks, going to shows, going to events,
you know, it's like the majority of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends smoke.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're always excited to, dude,
you got to try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, like, yeah, this white thorn
rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some of that and I was sharing it
with all my friends and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's fucking feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, you know, and I'm back to,
I like some of those feel good ones where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a sativa where they would
classify it as narcotic or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a stimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhere in the middle where you
smoke it and you're just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a big smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you smoke it, every time I
smoke that white thorn rose, my buddy's
[SPEAKER_00]: blue 13, it puts a smile on my face and I
feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just feel, it doesn't matter
whether it's in the morning, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: at night, it's just feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just something about those
where it has just those effects where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you feel great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't tried, I mean, I've tried
the rosin of the white thorn, that same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is, is when it's good like
that and I only had a gram, I just smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's easy to smoke a gram when it
makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how'd you get your start in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been at this for a while,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, I remember like, well,
90, 1994 guy I knew he was like running
[SPEAKER_03]: some from some people from a park and he
just running through property.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm after property and runs into like this
crazy ass field, like hundreds of plants
[SPEAKER_03]: in full flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, that was kind of my start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like he just started telling
everybody and we had pound, we had garbage
[SPEAKER_03]: bags and pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest problem was trying to dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, yeah, I like, you know,
ever since then, and like, I got in a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of trouble as a teenager, lucky for the
young offenders act in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause anything you do gets sealed when
you're 19 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm definitely had a lot of ups and
downs and just got in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, once I was about 17 years old,
I kind of figured out the right path or
[SPEAKER_03]: became pretty good at what I was doing and
then just kind of stuck with it my whole
[SPEAKER_03]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, 96 was the very first indoor
that we got into.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I was walking through a path,
um, in my neighborhood and I just happened
[SPEAKER_03]: to be walking by and this guy opens his
door and the light just comes blaring out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can't hide it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sees that I saw it and he tells me
to come over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we ended up like, no,
don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up started talking and it was
just a four lighter, but he didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: any money for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember buying general hydroponics and
that was our very first, uh, four lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so three part was good back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember three part and I never had a
problem with it back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never hated on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, that's what, that's what everybody
like, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the mid nineties, like that's
what everybody used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ozzy tonic was that what it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: It said for bigger bank accounts and
larger yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this other product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used a couple other products,
cool blooming, just a few other things
[SPEAKER_03]: that we used back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, I had like lots of,
um, success.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like, by the time I was in like
my, like the early two thousands,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was more like the person in charge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't me really growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, I went on a pretty nice
run with that for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I actually had gotten into out of
it for almost like a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was playing poker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I evolved into playing online poker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, I'd done really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was playing 16 tables at a time and
a couple hundred thousand hands or over a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple hundred thousand hands a year and
doing a really successful at it,
[SPEAKER_03]: just killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day, um, everything got
seized by the FBI, like poker stars in
[SPEAKER_03]: full tilt got shut down and they seized
all the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that put me, yeah, like it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and it was, uh, I ended up getting
my money back like a year and a bit later
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever, but I was like relying on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I was doing, you know,
I had, I thought, okay, well, this is my
[SPEAKER_03]: career, what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really good at this and I can make
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but then that happened and that like
pushed me back into growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, um, I bought these,
uh, cause like, this isn't legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are still the wild west.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, we bought these cargo trailers
that were like portable so that like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can just hook up the power and water.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's an issue, you can get them out
of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I hook, I bought like, well,
I set them up like a 10 lighter and an
[SPEAKER_03]: eight lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the very first crop, like I've been
so out of touch with growing like,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause it wasn't me, the one that was doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like, this is hilarious,
but on the 10 lighter, I did about two and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half pounds, but a total crop and the
eight lighter, like a pound and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I literally locked them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I remember my buddy being like,
how does it feel to be like the worst
[SPEAKER_03]: grower in the world?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a couple of people were just riding
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like going crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like frustrated cause I needed the
money too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, then I just went and I
talked to every last OG I know pick their
[SPEAKER_03]: brain, you know, like that's growing the
true kills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like on the next crop,
I just knocked it out of the fricking
[SPEAKER_03]: park.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like, just from that point on,
it just kind of got better and better and
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the medical licensing came out
and that was just like, so nice when it
[SPEAKER_03]: came out, having an actual medical license
and having that security.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when it first got issued,
you actually get like a government ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, remember getting stopped
and the cops are like, Oh fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they could smell it and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember showing it to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cop had never even seen it or even
heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember just having that card being
like, Oh, it's literally your get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: jail card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like such a relief when the cops
weren't, you know, weren't used to it
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then, yeah, I just went on a really
nice run doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started making YouTube videos
and then like one day I made a video
[SPEAKER_03]: saying like, Hey, is there's any led
companies out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an led and I'll prove that it
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was an HBS guy and didn't believe
in them at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally a company reached out to me
and you know, I tried it and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that, Hey, this is,
this is working pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like halfway through the crop,
I was like, Hey, if this goes well,
[SPEAKER_03]: can I get the Canadian distribution
rights?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time they, they were nothing and
didn't have any money anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were happy to be working with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then that went on and then it just,
it was kind of crazy how fast things
[SPEAKER_03]: happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, four and a half years later,
I ended up just starting up my own
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how stuff can snowball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like the power of, um,
I always try to tell people that anything
[SPEAKER_03]: can happen so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what can happen in one year?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you work on it every single day and
don't give up, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the power of doubling too,
like of, you know, or having one facility
[SPEAKER_03]: and going to two facilities and then going
to four, three or so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scaling is an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But while having a work ethic and also
knowing about, I think it's also a skill
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to pull the, be able to pull
the plug too, when you need to,
[SPEAKER_03]: like not every idea I've had, like even
with the led lighting, like we've made
[SPEAKER_03]: plenty of mistakes and had to change
direction or change what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: or you have to be able to identify,
Hey, this isn't working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to pull the plug and change
something or adjust or adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being okay with making mistakes is one of
the biggest things in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can learn how to be okay with
making mistakes, then you have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also recognizing that it's a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause I feel like I've made over
the last two years, especially with James
[SPEAKER_00]: Lodgenetics, I made a bunch of mistakes,
but I learned from them and they made me
[SPEAKER_00]: smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made me better at what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I'm, I'm focused on the
plants now and being the one that's making
[SPEAKER_00]: the decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I've always kind of said that,
like you have to take responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't admit it, or try to blame it
on somebody else, you're not going
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and sometimes there's like,
I've had to come to Jesus moments where I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that nobody's going to come there
to save me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to save myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are some, those are some great
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we all need to go through
because a lot of times in life,
[SPEAKER_00]: even when it's talking about, I've been
going to the gym lately by myself and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had workout partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like workout partners to a degree,
but I also just like going and doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: work and nobody's going to come save you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get in shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your friends can't go workout with you,
you need to go to the gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want to be in shape,
you, if you're maybe you don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you can go for a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can go for a walk, but same
thing with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nobody's going to, you know,
if you don't have anybody that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go thin the plants out, you got to thin
them out yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the truth and reality of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sooner you can get over that kind
of stuff and just suck it up and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck it, this is what I got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be the best person that I can
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think those are, those are the
important things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny you said the gym, because like that
is one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've been trying to brace myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done any real physical workout
or any like work, been at a gym since my
[SPEAKER_03]: early twenties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the last month, I've been doing a
couple hundred pushups a day, trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: brace myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, yeah, like you said,
like no one's going to do it unless you do
[SPEAKER_03]: it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to come save you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to come force you to the
gym.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so hard at like, I just even
remember like, it's kind of motivating now
[SPEAKER_03]: cause I can do it so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the, after the first day of just
doing a couple of days, I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you just get so sore and getting it over
that hump of being able to just have the
[SPEAKER_03]: motivation to do it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I think there's, there's showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important because
that's repetition and that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it requires a, a certain amount of
discipline, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just showing up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting there and showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it comes to working out,
like putting the effort in, because I look
[SPEAKER_00]: around the gym and they all look the
fucking same as when I was going to the
gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago and I'm getting really good
results right now because I'm putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I go, I make each rep count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do long workouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do shorter workouts, but I go there and
I'm there for a purpose and I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there to socialize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there to get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I haven't worked.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the Emerson effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Emerson effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of talk about that lately,
just like online and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I think it's a little bit confusing
because people think the Emerson effect,
[SPEAKER_03]: that means a lot of people think that's
like putting your plants to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not, it's just really the
combination of 680 nanometer and or lower
[SPEAKER_03]: and 720 nanometer and higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it's just having deep red and
far red combined together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it allows the photosynthesis of the
plant to be more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we've seen lots of people just
without even like using it to put the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants to sleep, um, have faster crops by
if anywhere from like two to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain the difference between
deep red and far red?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so deep red is like 660 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're looking at it on a scale
and, and far red is 730.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, um, yeah, like they're,
they're right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep red, like too much far red also is
not good for your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, um, far red, like in double ended
HBS, a lot of people criticize it too,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause they don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all like, Oh, you,
it's got way too much far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's got 6%, but then like a lot of
people blame stuff on far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I always argue back, well,
HPS has 10.4% and it's never turned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I always come back to that
and say, it's another variable that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: blaming it on far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we find, I find far red, um,
just so beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when we were adding, like we have
lights that can control it independently
[SPEAKER_03]: or that have it fixed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could just see that having it in
the spectrum on the plants like it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They pray better, just everything about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get better color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for color, which color is
such a big qualifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's, it's one of the boxes that needs
to get checked with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think what I've seen with
the Favins is you're getting, but with
[SPEAKER_00]: their, their under canopy, they have far
red and doesn't have far red in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gets purple, purple buds on
the bottom that are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's just, you know,
I think the potential for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to see you're under your,
your, um, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've, um, we've, we've kind of
designed it to have more light per watt
[SPEAKER_03]: than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be coming in with a
cheaper price.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of going to shake up the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've done with a lot of our other
lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we've, what we've really done,
what we've really shaken up the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: just with some of our lighting,
with the value, um, in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we're able to do that
is because we're extremely efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've been, well, we've been at this
for a while and it's like everything we've
[SPEAKER_03]: done, we're setting up where like our
competitors are spending tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: of dollars a month on rent where we don't
pay rent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're just, we, you know,
for our Michigan distribution,
[SPEAKER_03]: we just bought our building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and we're just every, like in that
aspect, we're just set up, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: so much more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of, I built an army of people
working on commission, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: over 50 people and you don't get paid
unless you actually make a sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a lot more motivating for
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always tried to do that too,
with grows, like I've all the grows over
[SPEAKER_03]: my years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I didn't like having workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like having partners make someone a
partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bleed together if we're going to bleed
and it's, you know, it's motivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I've always tried to,
you know, it doesn't always work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had a broken, so many people
trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like starting to start a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember like I've had, we could just
say other businesses on the distribution
[SPEAKER_03]: and people think, Oh, I'm going to start
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, good luck, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like trying to start something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try working at every single day yourself
for a year before you're even going to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about hiring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like any business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had a really, I had a donor,
like I owned a donor business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't work, I didn't work it,
but I had like a really good, this girl
[SPEAKER_03]: that was an employee and she was just an
incredible worker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did so well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like the second you get to
somebody that's doing the bare minimum,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just like the place fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's, it's such a challenge a lot of
times because of the balance, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like hard to find someone that
complimentary that that's willing to put
[SPEAKER_00]: in the work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always like, I'm the workhorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind being the workhorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to have someone that's
complimentary, that's able to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, you don't need an
exact duplicate of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need someone that's the complimentary
version of yourself that adds the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I've gone through enough
relationships and partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love partnerships, working with people,
bleeding together, winning together and
[SPEAKER_00]: losing together, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it makes losing not as bad
and it makes winning even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the right partner can make it amazing
and the wrong partner can just make it
[SPEAKER_03]: hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I almost like I've had to make
deals in my life where I almost felt like
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a poor decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like a poor deal on my half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say, for example, it's a 50-50
partnership except for I'm doing all the
[SPEAKER_03]: work and the other person put up the
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people criticize that,
but I always, you know, I'm the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: made the deal and yeah, it sucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't really fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of our five years, we got,
that was the reason why I got way ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in having that and being able to
recognize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I know a lot of people don't
think it's fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you don't have the money to
start, sometimes you have to- You have to
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrifice something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to sacrifice something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I could remember, like I had a
five-year deal on a place and I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like after a few years and we were doing
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I used to, I didn't bring this up,
but on YouTube, I was probably the first
[SPEAKER_03]: person in the world that put the most
aggressive leaf strip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Online and like before three a light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just like, I would bring in a crew
and I would strip my plants naked in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember- Day 21, you just- Oh,
I actually would do it on day 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, if I can, unless I needed the
plants to fill out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, we would get like crazy
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason why I brought this up is
I'm 50-50 partners, but I'm responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm bringing people in to do it and
pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming out of my side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and like I, you know,
it deals like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be frustrated with, but at the
same time, well, Hey, I ended up like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not complaining about on the money I
made on owning the host house at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of the five years and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, sometimes you just have to,
you could say, make a deal with the devil
[SPEAKER_03]: if you have to, or makes an unfair situate
deal to get ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they're unfair in a certain
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just all about life is all about
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like exactly a perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in the bigger picture,
unfair because like, they put up like,
[SPEAKER_03]: how hard is it to save up six digits plus
of money and, and also have the balls to
[SPEAKER_03]: invest it and do it without securing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of it comes down to balls
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've had a pretty good track record
for when it comes to like investing and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff or like getting people to come or
like if I come to someone for money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, I've never really had too
much of a problem, but I can understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've had a lot of other people that
have said, no, you know, what I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: or that just because they're afraid of it
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, if you have a pretty solid
business plan and a track record,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's not all money is good
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about finding the right partner
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that happen before, you know,
myself and myself too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I wasn't happy with my partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm associated with, I mean, I'm in the
perfect situation now with my partner and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're the balance with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we contribute both of us
contribute a lot to the business and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, I wake up in the
morning and I'm excited to come to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the, you know, you know,
it's good when you wake up at five in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I'm going to the gym and then
I get to go to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just enjoy everything you've built and
just everybody that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of feel the same way,
even though I'm busier than I've ever been
[SPEAKER_03]: in my whole life by far, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have late nights in China,
you know, four to five times a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just, and I enjoy it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy the hustle I've been, and it's
rewarding to see where we're at too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like in the last two and a half
years, so much has changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even when I go back a year from now,
and it's like, it's, it's such a rewarding
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling of like, I put, I was in the
craziest fight of my life and just every
[SPEAKER_03]: single day I just wouldn't stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, we're really reaping the
rewards and we're not slowing down at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we can really, we've brought
things to the market and we can innovate
[SPEAKER_03]: in other ways or do anything at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it takes us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not getting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when it's tough putting the left
foot in front of the right and the right
[SPEAKER_00]: foot in front of the left and just keep on
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we got killed in our very first year
in juice, you could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like I, like I didn't borrow from a
bank or anything you could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just like, I did everything
myself without having to bring anybody in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after about a year, one of my
friends kind of jumped in and helped just
[SPEAKER_03]: because he could see how well things were
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we haven't taken on any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those are the best,
but also we've struggled, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, it's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, everybody thinks that you're doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you know, it's like, yes,
but it's been a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good things are never easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in my experience, most of the
good things are challenging and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: reward and a lot of gratitude for
everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we caught a really big break about a
little over a year ago with a client from
[SPEAKER_03]: Dubai and we just did like a, well it was
166,000 like deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like we designed a custom light
from them and it was just like a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: break for us that just allowed us to kind
of get into another league.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was it for indoor cultivation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for growing lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like three tier, two tier more than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like insane tier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't even remember how many,
but like just the most ridiculous setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they originally had come to us
with a design that was horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we redesigned everything and just
improved.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're uniformity and we have them as a
client too, for like, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing another massive project with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really just changed things for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never know, like when you start a
business, you never know how long it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually with, if you do build outs,
it takes twice as long and twice as much
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, just cause you have an idea
that's good doesn't mean you're
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily going to be successful with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there is risk involved,
but once you, once you start seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: signs and it's like, you know,
you're honest stuff and figuring out just
[SPEAKER_03]: how to do everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we had so many learning experiences,
like even from, with someone saying
[SPEAKER_03]: they're moving forward and not taking a
deposit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was someone that I thought was
as good as gold before that told me,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I made 500 lights for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they backed out and it wasn't a
model that like was popular selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like it, it, to be honest,
it tied it up for almost six months for
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it was just a learning mistake
and those types of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some crazy financial challenges
with just everything we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then having so many lights and then
figuring out which one's performed the
[SPEAKER_03]: best and then having stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was extremely challenging,
but it's, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a rewarding feeling getting to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally the whole research and development
aspect of it's pretty wild, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, cause you don't want to
just make another light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make a light that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has something that makes it stand
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a gazillion lights and then
there's knockoff lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, there's stuff coming out
of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're knocking off stuff and absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a crazy market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, you know, we wanted to do
something different and that's where we
[SPEAKER_03]: came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, we, like I always say to
people, it's like name any company and
[SPEAKER_03]: compare it to one of our lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's like break it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a lot of cases, you're getting double
the value with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means like the light cost double
the cost to make, but it's retailing for
[SPEAKER_03]: the same price.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where people that like,
when they start going down that rabbit
[SPEAKER_03]: hole, it leads them to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if they want that they want to have
the best value, they want to have the most
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to have the most diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it to run the coolest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming to us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about your bug light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we have the very first registered
pesticide light in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like about two years ago, my
father-in-law came across an abandoned
[SPEAKER_03]: patent from like the early two thousands
that gave us the right concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we kind of started going down this
rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what we started doing research on
UBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like UBC is it's been common.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been used for years to like kill bugs
and labs and all different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hasn't been used the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we developed a, we came up with a
concept and there was one other company
[SPEAKER_03]: that was on the right track.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the right idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why you don't know who they
are is they started, well, I'm positive
[SPEAKER_03]: that they started faking the research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like saying that the light is runs for
this long and it will wipe out and do all
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they started doing even studies
showing pictures before and after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, you would think if it
was truly true, they would have fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: blown up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we realized like for the amount
of time that they were using it,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I started doing, I bought their
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even tested it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely doesn't work, what they were
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started going down this rabbit hole
and it's like, it's a really, it took us
[SPEAKER_03]: like a year of R and D of trying all
different types of diodes, different
[SPEAKER_03]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden on one of the tests
that we did, it was just stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we started, I used to, I don't know
if you saw this post, we'd be making
[SPEAKER_03]: posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, anyone got spider mites?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's got like, I want spider mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd make posts saying I want spider mites
or I want thrips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started working with someone that
was even breeding them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were introducing, I had four
different people that were participating
[SPEAKER_03]: with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heston was one of the people that,
you know, Floriform that came on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was doing it with another lab
too, that was participating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were introducing five to seven
spider mites and we were beating them in
[SPEAKER_03]: seven days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we started introducing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like after the very first test,
I thought, okay, well we can beat spider
[SPEAKER_03]: mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we could because you introduced
five to seven mites and we're beating them
[SPEAKER_03]: within a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started adding, well,
on the very first test I added like over
[SPEAKER_03]: 200.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got this all doc, the footage
document I'll be able to show you here
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm about to start releasing this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had like, it had hundreds of eggs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after about 36 hours of them being
established, we started treating them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't beat them, but we could reduce
their spread by over 95%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by like day 21, they were still
weren't even webbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was just like a game changer for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, we've evolved a lot
since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, we're about to start doing a
whole bunch of testing, but I would still
[SPEAKER_03]: say it's like one, like with what we were
doing, it was a straight up 95%
[SPEAKER_03]: protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so basically if spider mites come in
your room, you're gonna be in a 95% better
[SPEAKER_03]: situation if you don't beat them in the
first week, like if it's a serious
[SPEAKER_03]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with thrips, the same thing I had
while we were doing, like I happened to
[SPEAKER_03]: have the very first day I got them,
I happened to get an unplanned infestation
[SPEAKER_03]: of thrips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just like the best thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I documented it and we're beating
them by 97 to 98%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like thinking, hey, this is
absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the top 30 plus inches, like we cannot
see a thrip and any of the thrips or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything you see is like out where the
light isn't treating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's try using it to stress out the
plant to get higher THC and terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started doing two 15 minute
treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six days later, there were no fucking
thrips in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a fellow from California,
Matthew Gates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know who he is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sync Angel?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I consider him like he's just a
really smart guy, really knows IPM really
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we flew him out to see like,
Hey, can you define a thrip?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'd been talking to him and he had
seen what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I just wanted him to see it and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, he can't, he didn't see the
whole crop, but he could see the footage
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to like, well, the thrips were
alive and he came down for the end and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not a living thrip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've done multiple tests by now
and it's yeah, conclusive, like thrips are
[SPEAKER_03]: a problem of the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can beat them without pesticides or any
type of predator bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the light works, you do treatments,
a couple of treatments a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs in the middle of darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it doesn't have to run in the middle
of darkness, but, um, everything that I
[SPEAKER_03]: had done, like for their research shows
like bugs are attracted the light in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of darkness and it's not enough to
wake it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, we like, we even have like over a
year of using it like longer times at
[SPEAKER_03]: nighttime, but you can definitely use it
in the middle of the darkness is when we
[SPEAKER_03]: recommended if someone was nervous about
it, they could do it right after the
[SPEAKER_03]: lights go out or right after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so it, um, so it also works to
kill mildew and enhance THC and turpines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like the ultimate,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sounds too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like a lot of people use UVA and they
put UVA in their lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would never do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, UVA, the diets don't
last nearly as long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we have these souped out lights
with all these five year life diets,
[SPEAKER_03]: we would never put UVA in the same fixture
that doesn't last nearly as long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to that, I've seen tons of
side-by-sides over the last five years,
[SPEAKER_03]: UVA versus not.
[SPEAKER_03]: At most we ever saw was a little over a 1%
increase in THC with sacrificing turpines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it was never really that big.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think very much of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then UVB on the other hand has a much
higher efficacy than UVA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So UVB is from 280 nanometer to 350
nanometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though any of those side-by-side tests
that we saw, there wasn't was a huge gain
[SPEAKER_03]: of two to 3% in THC and one to 2% in
turpines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you got UVA and then you've got
UVB, which has a way higher efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've got UVC 100 to 280.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, like that was why it was such
a big deal to get this registered in the
[SPEAKER_03]: States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you had to go through all this
different stuff with the EPA, which is not
[SPEAKER_03]: an easy thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so UVC has a much higher
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also made an accidental discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we had it on, we had a room where a
timer failed and the light was on for 12
[SPEAKER_03]: hours and it fucked up every part of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the light was down by the stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is when we discovered that,
hey, it's affected every part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can admit UV systemically into the
plant through the bottom of the plant to
[SPEAKER_03]: enhance THC and turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we couldn't, there's no literature on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be like, it was an
accidental discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's a lot of people are going
to be messing around with this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't even like with our lights and
having our, we call it the tarantula
[SPEAKER_03]: predator.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need any UV supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the ultimate UV that's working
underneath your canopy that also protects
[SPEAKER_03]: you from mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to like be a cure for
mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like you could technically kill
mildew if you put it within like a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: distance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have something that's causing
mildew, it's airborne.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, yeah, if you've got a
problem, it's not going to be a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've seen a mildew happen to two
major reasons why it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I see if someone doesn't have a
room properly insulated and it gets cold
[SPEAKER_03]: and then hot, and then it starts rotting
in the wall, or it just simply getting too
[SPEAKER_03]: cold with the humidity too high at
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if you're doing that every single
night, we can't cure that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your VPD is not correct, but it
definitely does work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just overall, it's just such a
competitive edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of price are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_03]: To do a four by four area, it's going to
be 225 US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super reasonable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were working on a UVA bar wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like already done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just working on the certification,
but I was ready to abort it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we didn't, it's a fluorescent bar
that will attach to any fixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like, we didn't use UVB diodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a lot of other companies that
are, but the technology isn't really there
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say that like in a fluorescent bar,
it was 80% more efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting 80% more light per watt
because I'm using it in a fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we went in that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with the UVC in our predator,
like I'm pretty much going to abort it
[SPEAKER_03]: because what's the point of having UVB and
UVA when you've got UVC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's also cool about it,
you can get it anywhere in your canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the lights, they float, but they spin
360 degrees and you can move them up
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere in your canopy if you wanted it
up by your upper flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I know it's kind of hard to
visualize, but basically when you have
[SPEAKER_03]: clones, they go above pointing down at
your clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also for like someone like you
that has genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game changer for your mother rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, cause you can't have to,
the more you have, the better,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more coverage you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like for me personally, if I had any
type of genetics or any type of breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: my mother rooms would be covered in them
just because it's the ultimate protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we haven't got to test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're working with a major university
with like a, with the dean of a major
[SPEAKER_03]: university.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say yet, but once it's everything
is published, they're assisting with the
[SPEAKER_03]: white papers and we're, so we're going to
have all the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I believe it's going to work on
everything to be quite honest,
[SPEAKER_03]: like russet mites, broad mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will work on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's so effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a game changer too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause russet mites and broad mites,
is there a pain in the ass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can use microthyle disperse
and sulfur for russet mites and broad
[SPEAKER_00]: mites to a degree, but there it's not easy
to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you're spraying
sulfur on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can't use it for extra smoking
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to smoke sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sulfur is such a, yeah, it's, it's such a,
like we see it with the potential to end
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides on food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like the ultimate IPM,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like really it's the most safe method
of a pest management on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, we were doing well
against spider mites, but that was a 10
[SPEAKER_03]: minute treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried two 15 minute treatments
yet on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like we might be able to beat spider
mites the same way we might be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: beat thrips.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we already know it's so effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, we can't hold it back anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, and that's, well,
it's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we literally have it leaving for the
USA at the end of this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get some of them for the
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, it's a game changer,
especially for someone like you that's got
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you had one piece of advice for
your younger self coming into the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the experience that you have now,
what would that be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I definitely would like,
I definitely wouldn't have acted as
[SPEAKER_03]: unprofessional as I did in some cases,
like going back like a, like this is
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm crazy conservative.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last two years that you've known me go
back like a couple more years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could consider me as a hothead or
would speak out or I'd be canceled for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just like a, so I would say
being conservative, like never,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, I think the ability to know if you
have a bad, if something's not working
[SPEAKER_03]: out, you have to abort or reconfigure and
move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm being able to see that or pull the
plug and start something new, I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: one of my biggest pieces of advice I could
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are trying to get ahold of you want
to know more about your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Either like grand master level.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Instagram, grand master LEDs,
just type in grand master LEDs on Google
[SPEAKER_03]: and our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be able to, we have a chat contact
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're super easy to get ahold of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to doing it again,
checking out your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
