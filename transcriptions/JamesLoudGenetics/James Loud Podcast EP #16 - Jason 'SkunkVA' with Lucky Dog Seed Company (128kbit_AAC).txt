[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my special guest is Jason Skunk,
VA, a steward of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the guy responsible for being the
steward specifically for the chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, the 91 chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's in Montana now, and he's got his
own Lucky Dog dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started Lucky Dog Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: James, good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my big question to start everything off
is how did you get to Montana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, I've been in the Bay Area
since, you know, a little bit before the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead ended in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where you get deposited
when you get deep into that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I ended up moving up to
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there for 30 years, almost,
almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had my daughter there,
got married, got divorced, lived life
[SPEAKER_00]: there, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to grow weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where I was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as things got going with the
legalization in California, Prop 64,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of, I was on probation for
some, some cannabis crimes, kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of had a lot of felonies,
pretty serious case, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as how it can be these days in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, I got arrested in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, as, as I saw legalization
coming on probation and kind of going
[SPEAKER_00]: through my case, I just started to dawn on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to really be able to pull
it together there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, when they come to you,
they come with a wrecking ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and they wreck everything for
you and any kind of convenience you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want or what they, or what they
think you may want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take that away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really did a good job of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I did pretty good there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once I got through it,
I still wanted to, you know, I had plans
[SPEAKER_00]: for legal cannabis and my place in it,
you know, as far as clones and seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just kind of randomly got asked
by someone I used to know to come up here
[SPEAKER_00]: and check it out in Bozeman, Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never thought I'd even be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with I've been everywhere in
the United States, but I never came
[SPEAKER_00]: through Montana and came up here,
scoped it out right, right before the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit and, you know, fell in love with the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a beautiful place,
low key, low scale, not too much pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: not, you know, a commitment as can,
you know, these things can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so got the ball rolling and then the
pandemic hit, you know, which slowed the
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections and the licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was planning on spending probably
half my time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most beautiful places I've
ever even been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of work, as you know, and I had a
partner who was, you know, in it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he just saw how much it was and
how difficult it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not going to be like a
grand slam right when we hit up the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he bailed that summer and kind of
left me holding the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, that would have been,
let's see, we've got our license in like
[SPEAKER_00]: October of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, there was just nothing
going on until, you know, 21, 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we finally opened the doors to
the dispensary in 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been up here since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left in April of 21 for the last time,
not really knowing where I was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: and how long I was going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just never left because,
you know, this stuff, as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: consumes every bit of your time and
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty much why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, on the same coin,
I just, I love this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of reminds me of what the Bay
Area was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people around here would
hate to hear this, but kind of what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the, you know, the late nineties,
early two thousands where things were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people wave to you as they drive
by and people say hi and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of it, you know,
and things are going good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful that it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, like I said, when I was talking to
you before we started here, that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: back in Sonoma County in April for
Memorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I found myself full of
gratitude that I was no longer there,
[SPEAKER_00]: as hard as that was to face because it's
just, you know, the people, my circles
[SPEAKER_00]: were like people who were deep in the
black market, very much scaled up and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just, it's not going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no, it's going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people are struggling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really interesting because I
see what you're doing over there in
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana and you have a lot of green flower
as far as what I could gather from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the Bay area, everybody's
like demanding it's got to have purple
[SPEAKER_01]: color and all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're still back, you know,
you stuck with your roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got chem 91, you've got the tits and a
lot of your genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, we started off about 56 cultivars
here that I've been holding onto for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, various amounts of time,
but all long time, you know, like the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog I've had in my possession for,
well, except for when I got arrested,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a short period of time,
but for almost 30 years now, I guess about
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 28 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but we have, we've gathered a lot of
other genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we were running, we started off
just running clone onlys that everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of just thinking, Hey, what,
you know, that's the obvious strategy and
[SPEAKER_00]: get people to come to the doors because,
you know, people up here, it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's more homegrown, more wholesome
to customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, they're not really
interested in what they heard about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they probably didn't hear about
it, you know, and it could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic of this person can be anywhere
from 25 to 75, but it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people come through the door and
they've heard of strains and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've tried to get stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls into that line, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we've done pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've done some nice selecting,
but the idea was to kind of get things
[SPEAKER_00]: you've heard of, you know, the classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now this, now this year we're
doing our own selections or we're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: our own selection that we're getting,
you know, really good response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's starting to go out wholesale
around the state, the lucky dog stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's making me really happy
because I always hoped that would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, part of the journey,
you know, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few strains here now,
I think that we offer, um, any day we have
[SPEAKER_00]: 54 strains out available for the customer
to choose from, you know, what size
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation space do you guys have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're under 2000 feet right now,
2000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and some of that's for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that's for the nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it's the thing about
Montana that's interesting that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: people might be interested in is that,
uh, when, when I came here it was medical
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was the thing called tethering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to be tethered to a medical
dispensary as a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't shop around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to pick one and be tethered to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now I don't know if they were allowed
to be if you could go to others,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you definitely had to be tethered to
at least one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, and then the other part was,
is that it was vertically integrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: forced vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you grow, whatever you
produce, the hash you make, the rosin you
[SPEAKER_00]: make, whatever it is, you have to sell
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell to other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, you, so when I got here,
I honestly hadn't really thought too much
[SPEAKER_00]: about, oh my God, we're going to have to
build a fucking dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we did and it's gorgeous and I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually been like, uh, on the rough
days, some of my, you know, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like meditation to be able to go in there
and kind of put, you know, my artwork on
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall and, you know, build the place
out, make it look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they got rid of vertical
integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in January of 21, 22, uh, when the
full rec went into effect here and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, now we can sell wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can receive wholesale, you know,
of course the customers can go anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like the boutique aspect of it
that is vertical integration, but on a
[SPEAKER_01]: boutique level, which you don't really see
in California very often, if at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say it's kind of harder to
do that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's, I know there's some
people who do it, some companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we grow the cannabis in the same
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell it to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, our, our solventless lab is in the
same facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, our, all of our breeding and nursery
space is in the same facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, really it's kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, you come to work and it's
just, everything's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel like going to make hash today,
then you go make hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like, you know, whatever it is
you want to do, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's allows us to have like a very
small team that's super dedicated to what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really, I'm not a big scale guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't feel like there's always just
endless amounts I have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you find that little sweet
spot where you can find some comfort and
[SPEAKER_00]: happiness in your life, but also,
you know, be creative and do the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want you set out to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, our tissue culture lab is
upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like what people would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very different, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a, let's take a stab at the
past and talk about, uh, how you got your
[SPEAKER_01]: start in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about how you started smoking
and the Grateful Dead and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of dive into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I started smoking when I
was, you know, a young boy in Virginia,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I smoked some swag buds first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the way it felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends ran to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then, uh, we were living with my
mom and my dad got divorced.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom and my sister and I moved into this
little apartment complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some, definitely some shady
people there, uh, in Richmond,
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this cat across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, uh, I don't know if he was Puerto
Rican or I think it was Cuban actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had like the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gold rimmed glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was missing a leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was missing a leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was always by the pool and everybody
else's, when all the other adults were at
[SPEAKER_00]: work, you know, um, you know, in the
summertime when we were raging out there
[SPEAKER_00]: as kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't know what it was,
but one day he invited me and my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: into his apartment and he had an Alaskan
Thunderfuck plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, and he just wanted to show it to
us for some reason, you know, we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, 14 or 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when he opened the closet door,
he had one beautiful plant in there under
[SPEAKER_00]: a metal halide light that looked like it
got shaken from a street lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just was like, well, it was like,
holy shit, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smell came at me and just that
humidity, that life, the humidity came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there and it wafted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love and that was, it was off to
the races, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, of course,
dead tour, I think everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't, they should that,
uh, you know, the Grateful Dead tour was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a bizarre, I mean, you know,
you can get whatever you want it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like what true capitalism is,
you know, you buy low and you sell high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and can't, Kind Bud was always a part
of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I saw that first plan of that
Alaskan Thunderfuck, I mean, that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time I'd ever seen Kind Bud,
um, smoked it shortly thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Richmond, you know, you know,
we were really, we had an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: little, uh, kind of a culture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like, we had like phenomenal herb when
we were young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was just, uh, these older,
older, this old, this circle of older
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were growing, you know, the Nigerian
and Afghan and the Beatrix choice and the
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk, of course, and, uh,
Northern Lights, number two, but we just
[SPEAKER_00]: called it Northern Lights, but I think it
would have been the number two,
[SPEAKER_00]: as they say now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the Nides, the Hades,
I mean, we just had like an array of like
[SPEAKER_00]: top-notch genetics that were, you know,
clearly selected by, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who knew what the hell they were
doing and really was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, these circles are
small, but in, at the time of Virginia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like one plant would get you
five to 40 years of penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where does that number come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, during the drug war, five to 40
sounds good on a commercial, on a campaign
[SPEAKER_00]: ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so it was serious business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, um, you know, it,
growing up there was different because
[SPEAKER_00]: like the drug war was, we were on the
front line there, even without even
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just, you know,
it was just a lot of people being
[SPEAKER_00]: incarcerated for cannabis and psychedelics
and, you know, uh, those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you kind of, you know,
you learned at a young age, how serious
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff can be and how, uh,
you know, when you make choices,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can, it can affect the rest of your
life potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you could, you know, you would see
it happen to a guy that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that a friend of yours knows or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so grew to have a respect for these
people, you know, for these older folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who were doing this because, you know,
I could put the connect the dots at like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, what a dedication that is to like
take that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, yeah, the weed's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing, but it's also a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to take that risk for that lifestyle,
I just always, it just took me back,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and kind of, I don't know,
it was kind of like mythical to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just wanted to know more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as, as it, as, as it goes in the,
you know, early nineties and late
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties, late eighties, really,
um, the Grateful Dead come through town
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were actually banned from Virginia,
but they still would pop through under a
[SPEAKER_00]: different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were actually banned by the state
legislature in 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that happens to rock and
roll bands or anything else of that size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think they probably wore that as a
badge of honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but anyway, so, you know, eventually
as I tell people, you know, they came
[SPEAKER_00]: through and brainwashed, you know,
kidnapped me and brainwashed me and
[SPEAKER_00]: dragged me all around North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asked me to do some shady stuff,
which was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all life, but definitely it gets
the law and always in the background,
[SPEAKER_00]: always every single day, cannabis was the,
the, the, you know, the focus because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when you go to a dead show and
you're a kid and you got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make a little money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in a Grateful Dead parking lot,
as they say, you just reach your hand up
[SPEAKER_00]: and grab yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's floating there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to take some risks,
but, um, so at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, you wanted the ticket,
a place to, you know, gas to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted, uh, you know, maybe a place to
sleep, some floor space at a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, maybe the well,
the ticket was always, but most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly after the ticket was a sack of
kind buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that was the medicine, you know,
that kept you, kept you okay on the road
[SPEAKER_00]: because it wasn't like, it wasn't like a
big fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of, you know, you're in big
cities in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it wasn't like exactly
spirals and rainbows every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of stress,
believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, kind buds, what can you
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you get into it and then,
and then after a while, you start to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, geez, you know, like every time I go
to a show, I'm in a different region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be in Ohio, like I mean,
New York or in the Boston area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Miami, we found a, a grower down
there that would, you know, come and look
[SPEAKER_00]: for us when we would get to town and they
would bring boatloads of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you could sell 30,
40 pounds of weed in a parking lot in a
[SPEAKER_00]: day and, and, you know, drink fancy beers
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a lifestyle and it was a
big part of, there's a lot of other things
[SPEAKER_00]: around it that, you know, you can't really
talk about public yet, but, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was always like the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, after a while as a 17
year old, kind of, I wasn't really a
[SPEAKER_00]: runaway, but like a young person out on
the road in America, like my big goal was
[SPEAKER_00]: like one day I'm going to, you know,
save up enough dockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get myself some grow lights
and, and some clones from Virginia,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully bump into one of these older
dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hook me up and, and grow some
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, that's exactly what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then when Jerry died,
I was, like I said, when you, when you,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you followed the Grateful Dead,
you, you certainly are going to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay area at some point, San Francisco Bay
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was no place for many
of us to go after the tour was over and we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't all the way on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there'll be winter tour,
spring tour, summer tour, fall tour,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was days between and what to do,
where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, where can we be safe and
where can we just kind of be ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: without causing a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Bay area certainly has a place
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanford Psycho was always, well,
it's different these days, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: always welcoming the freaks like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but then how to get to,
how do you like eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get gas?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feed your dog, your old friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, we sold weed in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we sold weed in Panhandle park
and the strangers and every Tuesday or
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday, you know, they try to switch it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always as today's SFPD would roll
through the park on dirt bikes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they were always watching and,
you know, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like this one little spot in the
Panhandle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd skateboard, do rail slides and hang
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, all kinds of people in
the city would come down there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and risk their own freedom to
get their, their, uh, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I sold weed to AIDS patients
and cancer patients and just all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who, you know, you know,
like you could see that it was the stress
[SPEAKER_00]: it was for them to have to come down to
the park and cop weed from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking kids was, you know, um,
probably really stressful for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would say that some of them,
they had no choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no other place for them to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped them, I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course there was a lot of other
people who were just getting off work and
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, the normal guy or,
you know, who wanted to buy some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, weed was really expensive in
the city back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was four and a quarter for weight,
you know, and it was always outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: never any indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the word hate comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, we would take,
uh, an ounce of weed and make 10 eights
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those extra two would be a little
extra cash for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of it would go right back to
the guy who had the weight up on Waller
[SPEAKER_00]: street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so anyway, that's, uh,
that's kind of how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met a gentleman from,
uh, Staten Island kind of coincidentally,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's the one who ended up giving me
the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met in the park actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he brought some indoor weed down,
uh, from Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had moved out from Staten Island from
New York and was trying to live out his,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, Grateful Dead fantasy,
seeing Jerry Garcia at the Warfield on
[SPEAKER_00]: Remarcus street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, you know, the apex of
Grateful Dead land is to be able to see
[SPEAKER_00]: him, see Jerry Garcia at the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he actually had a bunch of indoor
weed and it was $300 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, you know, a lot of those
people who we, I went through,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still like my brothers and
sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, for various reasons, but there
are still a few around and we have like
[SPEAKER_00]: this special connection because it was not
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was, you know, there,
you know, people getting robbed with guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my friends got shot on the street,
you know, and broad daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those cops were always there,
you know, like some people who maybe got
[SPEAKER_00]: further into drugs would, you know,
kind of not leave to go back on tour and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would stay in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, you know, very
disappointing and sad to see, but then you
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and they're gone after tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to Staten Island?
[SPEAKER_00]: So-and-so, you know, what happened to
Kathy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's, she's in, she got locked up,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got her second felony for holding
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, she's going to be away for
a minute, you know, or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: another gentleman moon, you know,
he, he became a fixture in San Quentin
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's, he got caught to me times up
on the street there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, changed who he was,
of course, like prison will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't always easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the days between trying to get
to the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, um, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going on a little too much
about that, but no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, that's what the show's all
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I think telling your
story and the story of the other side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grateful Dead, because people hear one
side about the music and there's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: nother side, you know, on the other side
of shakedown street that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people need to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we get older, there's less and less
people to tell the story to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something I've realized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've kind of, I've always kind of
realized it, but I somehow separated
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think lately I've just
kind of accepted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I have a good memory of
what those days were like, and I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: vivid memory of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, if we look around,
like, you know, Jerry used to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were doing, that this is the last
great American adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called the whole thing, you know,
and the whole thing is it's, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were falling a band, but it really was
so much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a whole culture that went
generations deep, you know, and I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like whole like aspects of culture
were developed and became tradition and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, around smoking even,
you know, um, so it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it's, it's kind of neat to be
able to tell people, cause you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, a lot of us, we were very reserved
and, you know, you, you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could definitely find yourself not
having anyone to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you talk too much about what was going
on out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, weed was just one thing,
you know, that was just a, a small aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: a large aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like a more minor aspect of some of
the work we were trying to do to kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bring some light into the world
and, you know, into a rather dark world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so, you know, I'm kind of,
I'm so grateful that that happened to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I do feel like I got,
you know, kidnapped in a sense and
[SPEAKER_00]: brainwashed in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I'm, I thank God every day
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it took me to the Bay area and
met my daughter's mother, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have my beautiful daughter and,
you know, these things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things were all, you know,
you know, seemingly coincidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you look back on it, it wasn't,
it was just, it's been, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's added up to a, to, in my opinion,
for my own life, an amazing life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, it hasn't been boring, hasn't been
easy, but it hasn't been boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have that whole thing to thank for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was that, that, you know,
broke me out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would have happened if it,
if I didn't decide to not go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Richmond, which was a tough decision,
you know, hitchhiking from Kansas to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay area with nothing, you know,
not even a dollar was because the van
[SPEAKER_00]: broke down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole long story, but, you know,
it was not an easy decision, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm glad I took the next step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept walking forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept, what's the next adventure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's this all lead to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm, I'm grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gentleman who I met in the park,
who gave me the Kim dog, he was very
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for me sewing all this weed that
day so he could keep his California dream
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's still a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just texted me and
[SPEAKER_00]: told me, Hey, you know, he was so grateful
for, for what I did for him that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was more grateful to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just, I don't think I expressed it well
enough, but he, he's like, when this is
[SPEAKER_00]: all over, he was a dead end, but he wasn't
on tour anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a little bit older and a lot of the
older people were not into the new
[SPEAKER_00]: keyboard player.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, he told me, when this is all
over, you know, if you want to get a house
[SPEAKER_00]: and some, you know, if you want to do what
you say you want to do, I'll hook you up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll, uh, you know, show you what I
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he, he pulled, he came through on
that after Jerry died in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never looked back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's always been what I've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, you know, one thing leads to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are, you know, we got weed on,
on the shelf that strangers can come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like my living room, but it's not
long strange trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like we are the, you know,
there's the evolution of the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: that turned into dead in company,
but we are the evolution of the Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead, especially working in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even Logonita's brewery,
I think Tony McGee from Logonita's,
[SPEAKER_01]: he to a degree in their company is the
evolution of the Grateful Dead and where
[SPEAKER_01]: they went, uh, you know, craft,
craft products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's, it's just an amazing,
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just so blessed to have been
able to get on this path, stay on this
[SPEAKER_01]: path and be where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those Lagonia's guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, uh, I like their style.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came here, the regulations,
as you know, are just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't keep up with it to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who makes this stuff up,
but it ain't anyone who knows anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first came here, my,
uh, the logo I have has a pot leaf on it
[SPEAKER_00]: out of hanging out of a dog's mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inspector came and he's like,
Oh, you can't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I can't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first, right when he told me,
I was like, Oh, I got an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I remember those guys in Petaluma
there, they, uh, they had that beer
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was K-R-O-N-I-K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ATF came and raided them and caught
someone smoking weed in the, in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the brewery down there and shut
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were like, they had to shut down
ale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, whoever, I don't know who it
was that the company sounds like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those folks, but they,
uh, decided to put censored over chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every year the censored gets us a
little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see chronic behind it with a K.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I don't know how that could be
problem for people, but, um, so that was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, we'll just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just do a Lagunitas deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just put the censored thing out in
front of the leaf and, and then see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boundary pushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're, they're boundary pushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a boundary pusher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pushing boundaries my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think that's how we make
progress is doing stuff we believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, let's dive into this,
the skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's talk about the name skunk VA
and how it got associated with chem dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think that's a great story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was your name on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, it was, it did come from
overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, uh, um, we have a mutual friend,
uh, boundary pusher as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, and, uh, he grew up with,
uh, um, he grew up in the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in New Hampshire, and he somehow
met a, you know, G chem dog at a fish
[SPEAKER_00]: show, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he got turned on to the
chem dog before I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some dead tour together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, as things kind of
progressed, I had, I got the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't even know this guy,
you know, I was only hearing it from my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend who, you know, who met him back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that I got this cut from
this guy who I didn't know at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he got it from him when they did a
trade for a super skunk cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, in the tri-state area,
kind of in New York, uh, some friends of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine in Virginia came up and traded the
number six super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an F2 super skunk for a chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point, um, my friend from
Staten Island, who, you know, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking about, he, he was the one that
went out and, uh, he got that cut and
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't know anything about the
origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really a story to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as you know, cause you're in my
demographic though, you know, those things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they didn't really matter that much
then, like they just didn't talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, you're really just
basically telling someone else's business,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that's a no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we were rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and going for it, but then I saw an
high times article, um, and I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, it must've been 2005 and it was
an interview they were doing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with G and I was like, Hey man,
that's your buddy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got these other chem dog sisters from
the original C-pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, you said he's your
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent those t-shirts out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, why don't you give
them a call?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go get some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get the sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to, I saw the sister in the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, God, man, that looks like the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just better, you know, like not
better, but stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, he was, you know,
uh, he just, it seemed like too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I don't remember exactly how I
got onto like the overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't something that I was doing or
even really knew about, but somehow maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I Googled something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know what it was,
but I saw that he was on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a picture of these people were
talking about the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I joined it, the overgrow thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was like, I just want to
send this guy a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this might be my one chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I, uh, I did all the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, he sent these t-shirts
out with this, uh, might even have it
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem dog logo, like, uh, this one
right here, it was on the front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like that one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he had, uh, uh, he sent a super
skunk went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I said, he got the super skunk
for my friends in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had the chem dog since 1991 on the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a cool shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and nobody else had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, you know, it was a gift
from him to my friend, to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, it meant a lot to me,
of course, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, Oh, I got an idea when
they let me make the avatar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'll put, I'll take a picture
of my shirt and he'll definitely recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can start chit chatting,
you know, cause I wanted to go get this
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in truth be told, I saw on the high
times article, I was, I was, I read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed there was no chem dog anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had all these other chem strains,
but not the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Hmm, maybe he doesn't have it,
you know, or, or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so anyways, I, I did just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put up some pictures of my plants up,
my chem dog pictures and my super skunks,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, my sour diesels actually at the time I
didn't have a super skunk at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my super skunk pictures were polarized
anyways, different story, but so,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, where'd you get that shirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we started talking and,
Oh, so the skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to like, you have to give
yourself a name, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Hey, we all do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like, everyone's got a thousand
different, you know, social media things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you got to have the special little
name and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was like, first time I'd ever
seen anything like this, or maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there wasn't much of this anywhere
to be seen anyway, uh, 2005, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like skunk, super skunk,
Virginia VA, skunk VA, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and then we got to talking and
then a month later, I'm in New York with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of chem dog cuts in a hotel in
Soho.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we met up and he ended up not
giving me the sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up giving me the Kim D and,
and what turns out to be the mass super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, don't know what happened, but the
number six somehow got turned into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mass super skunk, um, grew it,
took it back to California, flew back to
[SPEAKER_00]: California and grew them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Kim D, you know, spit out a bunch
of bananas on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first run, uh, we were overfeeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, and then the super skunk
turned out to be a, I guess we didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time it had similarities,
but it wasn't the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I kind of grew it twice, two crops of
it, let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, didn't smell like super skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it may have been good herb to
some, but to me, with the bias that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: in my mind of the super skunk,
it just, it just, it just was a
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointment to the point where I didn't
want to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, we saw that, you know,
but the good news is we brought the Kim,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kim D out to the West coast for the
first time it was out 2006 February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then he, I gave him a couple of
very healthy cuts of the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, that's, that's how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never went back on there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then I actually kind of forgot
about it, you know, cause I just did,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went through this whole overgrowth
just to kind of like get this,
[SPEAKER_00]: get this cuts from this guy or meet up
with him in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, fast forward six years,
someone gave me some cuts that were sick
[SPEAKER_00]: and, or they weren't sick when they gave
them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few weeks later, they were
definitely sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my plants were definitely sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm searching the soil with
a microscope and, you know, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out everything I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I came to a loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't know what the hell's
wrong with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're being poisoned
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I went onto, uh, one of the,
um, one of the newer forums and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, I called myself the good old
dog, you know, cause you started to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot all about this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I posted the exact same pictures
cause I didn't, I really wasn't taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of pictures of my weed during those,
you know, years of producing packs,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and somebody was like,
I got like, well, I'm not somebody I got
[SPEAKER_00]: like 45 people at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you get those photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you steal them from skunk VA?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't even know, you know,
until then 2012 or 13, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a friend of mine came over,
uh, uh, and he was like, have you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: Googled chem dog before?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, why would it, why would it
do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes just to Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pulled out my phone and it said skunk
VA cut chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, I'm in the dark over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea, you know, but that's how
you're running those packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, you don't have time to,
you know, pay attention to all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so whether or not you're part of
it or not, you know, you just didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time or I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never really thought much about it
until all that, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through, through Micah's mutual friends
back in the day, our mutual friend Micah,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's my ex, well, one of my business
partners, ex business partner,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever good friend we had a New York,
basically the New York city diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't so much as it was the chem 91
and they called it New York city diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the sour diesel, the New York city
diesel, and we had the dog DAWG and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was like the dog butt or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I thought chem dog,
I thought it was chem DAWG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, you know, we didn't have the
information as accessible at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, but, but the structure,
definitely the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it has a very unique structure that
you can't miss with the, with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: like very, very similar to sour diesel
with the, with the green leaves in that
[SPEAKER_01]: burnt tire on the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like it's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like for me, it's nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I smell it, I'm like,
fuck chem 91 from back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lights up the memory bank for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that part about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know, it's like,
it's just, it's not a particular memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a collage of just like,
the past and, you know, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some ways better days, you know,
not to say these days are no good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just, you know, more adventure,
more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like, really just hits you right
in the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know exactly what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our diesel is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like all the, all the genetics,
if you, if you were to smell the same
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff now, it'd bring you right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beauty of, of, uh,
these aromas, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's tied to so much more than
just, oh, it's good smoke, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are tied to experiences we've had in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I feel that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I, I would say to my memory,
my mom always used to point out to me
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, she said, ever since
you're born, the first thing you do when
[SPEAKER_00]: you find a new object, you know,
a piece of fruit or something she knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that I didn't have experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you do is stick it up
your nose and smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, I know that I noticed it because
I'm the same way, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, so I think my memory is very
much associated with, with my nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think so, so, breeding and
cooking and all these experiences that
[SPEAKER_01]: revolve around things like food and wine
and even, even tobacco, it's all based on
[SPEAKER_01]: data points, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the more data points you have,
the more of a library you have in your
[SPEAKER_01]: head, the easier it is to come up with
combinations, but also you have these
[SPEAKER_01]: libraries built around experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a tribe of Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, uh, I mean, it's so,
you know, and the thing about it is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like we in cannabis, we're very much keyed
into that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the cannabinoid thing is
not all figured out, but definitely we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of information when it comes to
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the next frontier is the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they affect the experience of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, of course things smell
good or don't smell good to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they smell like something and they
definitely draw a reaction from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, you know, it's, it's,
it's the new frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we are just on the, you know,
we're just learning about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these things are not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they're everywhere on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every human has had experience with
something that smells good, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: smells bad, something that smells
dangerous, something that smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a part of the human
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of our, our, you know,
our synapse system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's all in our head and it's,
it's meant to be here for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're here for it as it turns out too,
as growers and breeders and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in all kinds of fields across,
not just cannabis, of course, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, it's always something more
interesting coming down the pike when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: never gets old, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets old, you know, and now that
things are going legal, it's like now
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists can get involved in
universities and bigger, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and more powerful and more
well-funded organizations can kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: into this stuff and break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all get to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get to learn about it and how it
relates to us and the relationship we have
[SPEAKER_00]: with these things and the combinations of
them and what they do to our psyche,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they, how do they impact our life
even?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how do they enhance our life,
you know, and it's, it's amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's, it's been around since
the beginning of time on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now we're, you know,
we're, we're alchemists of turps now in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turps, thiles, you know, thiles,
like the, the skunks and the gas,
[SPEAKER_01]: like basically the gas, the, the rocket
fuel, all these things are thiles and it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why it's also so hard to measure
them in terpenes because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things that we really appreciate where
the, where the gas were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can talk about turpinoline and
limonene for hazes and we can talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: mercine and some, some other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we start talking about thiles,
thiles are really where there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of magic and there's a lot
of stuff we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, these relationships with the
cannabinoids and terpenes and we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just starting to scratch the surface
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe that, you know,
we'll, we'll have a better understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: over the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, it's, it's amazing to
be on the frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, and I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I've thought about it and it's,
uh, you know, when people come through the
[SPEAKER_00]: door, they, you know, they want the,
all right, what's your highest percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, that, of course, I can't help
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the people who work here
with me and my team, we're all on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: page with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't help yourself, take a
moment and just see, can we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that with this individual for a minute and
try to educate this individual about why
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not that important, why it really
doesn't mean that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we have some strains, uh,
on the table here that have low,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, THC and, you know, 19%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, but they're amazing experiences
that it's almost, uh, you can't say that
[SPEAKER_00]: something with 10% more is, is actually
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, why the, why is it like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we know a little bit,
we know that brain chemistry changes from
[SPEAKER_00]: individual to individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the cannabinoids are,
you know, they fit together different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, like a puzzle to, um, you know,
to impress the THC on your, on your,
[SPEAKER_00]: on your, you know, nervous system,
your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and that can change the
experience regardless of the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we're at the point,
like you said, we're at the point now
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're starting to discover that
different combinations of terpenes have
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects on cannabinoids and how
they relate and communicate with our brain
[SPEAKER_00]: and our nervous system and our
endocannabinoid system all through our
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's like, we're just on the
cusp of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to think that like, I always like to
use lavender as an example, cause it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like a single plant like cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, when you smell that,
no one's ever repulsed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't think I've ever heard anyone
go, I can't stand the smell of lavender,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even in large doses of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like, it's a universal kind
of calming, you know, relaxing,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like bringing peace and like
changes your breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes your heart rate even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's science, you know, that's not
because it smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but there's more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain is interacting with those
terpenes and allowing you to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of just calmness, you know,
and cannabis is that on steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's good, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a, it can enhance your life to
a degree that it's, it's, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure, you know, it's hard for anyone to
measure, you know, even us, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: day in and day out, this is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to measure how important that
can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always known this about,
well, I've known this for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis that we have a symbiotic
and a real time relationship with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, we're as, as growers,
we're like, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're like, we're checking you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't speak to me, you know,
you can't like, you can't point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do anything, but you're still
speaking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to tell me, what do you
need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants also with probably a much
more success than we have with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're, you know, we're like kind
of monkey brain, you know, we think too
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and we don't pay attention enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hardly listen enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has no choice, but to listen,
that plant can't get up and walk across
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and take care of its own needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has to communicate with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like we were just saying,
it communicates through the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, the cannabis
cannabinoids in it, and also the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think that's where we're at
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we've all been stoned out
of our mind on THC and combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, but now the terpenes are got
another thing to tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're, the plants are trying to
speak up and say, Hey, we have a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just got to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to listen and you got to take a
moment and you got to stop and smell the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking roses and it's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone, I know you do,
I do, we all do, you know, I know you do
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're all humans, you know,
and that's our nature, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just amazing because we're,
you know, like you said, we're right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're on a frontier right at the beginning
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can't wait to see what's
going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about breeding because
you're, you're into breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you do breeding, you do pheno
hunting, you got lucky dog seed company,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I love it because I feel like
there's only a handful of guys that are
[SPEAKER_01]: really stuck to their roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm, I'm more of about diversity
as far as my palate has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm always trying to explore and find
the new thing, but you really kind of have
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck to your roots with the chem dog,
with the genetics and doing some cool back
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you do incorporate some new
genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like you've, you know,
JJ from top dog, he's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you guys have really held
strong in your beliefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the way I look at it, and this is
not something I had like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a strategy at one point, it's something
that's kind of happened and here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, I love the chem dog,
you know, like I, I tell people this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have, you know, you know,
you, you go through life and you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you say the love of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the hell does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You start off and for me, it was my mom,
you know, she was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a saint, you know, like a goddess to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she, no, nothing could outdo her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still always will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and then, you know,
I love football.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was a young man, I fell in love
with the San Francisco 49ers long before I
[SPEAKER_00]: even came to the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the love of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't wait till the season starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, well, what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of stuff happened after,
but it came to the chem doc, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I love her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to believe that she loves me
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: She, I think that these things find their
stewards, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing special about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm saying, but I'm,
it's what I tell people is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when I talk to my customers
about having a clone for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 28 years, um, you know, it takes them a
minute to process that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do, I'm like, you know,
um, you know, it's like, I've been through
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff in life, you know,
and, you know, deaths, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: dying dogs, dying, you know, the worst
pains, the highest of ties, the joys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, marriage, divorce, raising a
kid, and there she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's still right there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I just want to inject what
we've done in the past, what it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, at some time you're like,
well, is this getting stale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for me, it's not, because that's
what we're still doing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a lot of fun, you know,
because you go through the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mothers, you know, like the pollen
receivers that you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, and you get to learn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find out about the flavors,
the experience, like the effect and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we cross it with our chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a whole new thing and it
happens that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing about chem dog is,
is that even though she's old,
[SPEAKER_00]: old girl, like she's dominating when she,
when you cross her and that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest part about developing that,
that stud that I've been using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the first several attempts,
um, it was just too dominant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything came too much like chem
dog, because when you do back crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's what you're selecting
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I started to kind of change my
strategy of selecting as I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: through it and maybe just, you know,
finding certain aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love just about a plant, not necessarily
like chem dog, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor and structure and just explosive
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I want someone to pop a
seed and just, it just blows up and blows
[SPEAKER_00]: their fucking mind, you know, and that's,
that's to me is, has to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a person's going to grow,
you know, have a light in their,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a tent in their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, they don't want to,
they're not going to go through a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand cuts to find the one they want
to, you know, they want to have like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want some success and they may be
limited on their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be limited on their resources,
on what they can apply to their project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want them to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I started kind of selecting not
just for chem dog traits, as far as aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and effect go, but also like
structure, vigor, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that kind of, once I went down
that road, it happened, everything kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: happened quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found one that, and so how did we
find that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do we know we found it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we crossed it to a lot of things
that, that I, when I say we, I mean me,
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it to a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finding out that you're getting
some unique crosses, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like F1s that are actually unique and then
bringing up the F1, you know, generation
[SPEAKER_00]: also not too much variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, when you buy a pack of seeds,
of course you want to like kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think you're getting,
you know, like you want to be surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasantly, but you don't want to just be
like, I don't know, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all different, you know,
you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess if I'm a breeder, it would be
because what I do is I make those and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through them and I try to weed out
the stuff that is got too wide of a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or of course, if they're just not,
not a good mix and it's not desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ones that make it through,
they got, you know, you could say two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three, you know, different types of phenos
that you can count on being in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly one that you planned on
seeing if that's who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted to be surprised,
but you wanted some really strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful, tasty, gorgeous, well,
you know, mostly gorgeous cans,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you look at, you would
want to, that can be in there as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we have, we're now
branching out in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing, we've got some
collaborations coming up with breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: you've heard of that are, you know,
just in the beginning stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up to this point, this is what we
we've been doing and we're going to always
[SPEAKER_00]: continue doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's time to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're breeding with our own in-house
things that we've made, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like steps along the way that we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, now it's going to change a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to expand and I'm more focused
on what I would like to see from Lucky Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Company is kind of like, you know,
like there's, there's like a division in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have like this old school,
like we see gassy and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: OGs and cushions maybe, and, you know,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have like the newer thing,
you know, and the newer thing is just
[SPEAKER_00]: taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be instead, you know,
what I've learned about the older school
[SPEAKER_00]: people is they're jaded, you know,
as older folks get, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, wow, back in my day, dah, dah,
dah, dah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get caught, I caught my,
I catch myself doing that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that's useful to sit in
a corner and snicker at the others,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at other aspects of cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have thought that like division
was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it's inevitable at times
depending, but I would rather like do
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborations with some of those breeders
and, and, and that style of, of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of the culture and just kind of
like, you know, maybe a little educating,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a little bit of just like enhancing
and maybe just like creating things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are even better than either, either side
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that's the goal is to,
you know, it's like, if you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding to cross these things together
and you're not improving the genetics on
[SPEAKER_01]: either side, what are you doing it for?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at the end of the day,
we're trying to improve things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I think Chem 91 is an amazing
classic, but there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements that could be made with the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that would be like reverse
what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I've had that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get plants, you know, now that I'm
like, wow, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it smells, you know, to me,
it's like the unique odor and aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors that I'm into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the high is always going to be top
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just, some stuff, you know,
and my customers verify is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was getting this such and such
this place and it just doesn't get me
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, everything, but it's got to get
me stoned, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pull out, you know,
some Crossroad Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I think you're going to love the
flavor of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to hit you hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to get you stoned
exactly every time you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true, you know, cause Kim dog has
that magical keep, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic, you know, and,
uh, sour diesel, all these types of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are always going to get you rip raw
and stone the way you like to be no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really it comes down to that,
you know, and there's not a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that you, you know, you build a tolerance
to it to a degree, but it's not like so
[SPEAKER_01]: many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the green cracks out there and
stuff, you know, where it's like a week
[SPEAKER_01]: later, it doesn't get you high chem dogs,
sour diesel, sour diesel at 14% will give
[SPEAKER_01]: you couch lock, you know, plus the Terps,
you know, I think refiring the joints,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, is a true test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the chem 91, all the,
all the chem dogs, sour diesels,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the crosses, even you get that,
you know, roach burn where you fire a road
[SPEAKER_01]: chip and it still tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to like all the way down
to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sweet, sweet, drippy, you know,
your tongue gotta happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, as far as, uh, what substrate do
you grow in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of nutrients are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is, what is, uh, your philosophy on
growing and cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we here keep an open mind when it
comes to our nutrients, we grow in cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, uh, you know, drain the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we try to do a little crop
steering, you know, we'd dick around with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, lately what we've been doing is,
uh, we've tried different, when I opened
[SPEAKER_00]: this place, uh, several of the nutrient
companies that are well known,
[SPEAKER_00]: they reached out to do their marketing and
the way a lot of that goes down is I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you understand that they'll like send
you a whole crop load of, of their
[SPEAKER_00]: products and say, Hey, will you run this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, this and that's what
you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my program that I had down in Sonoma
County for, for, for a good while now for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost, you know, almost 20 years,
really always worked well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, you know, I used to grow
organically in the, in the nineties and
[SPEAKER_00]: then early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a lot of success with it,
but as things got bigger, it just wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't sustainable for me, um,
to have the, keep the quality up the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it needed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you know, I got turned on to
hydroponics and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: salt based nutrients and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so up here, I couldn't get some
of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shipping on liquids is really
expensive and, you know, a lot of it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: even available here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to kind of open up, you know,
the mind and things outside the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've tried all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've tried the Athena.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, we had pretty good success with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the buds were big and all that,
but it didn't, uh, it kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: the final product was a little less than
desirable for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it all tastes like Athena.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my, my complaint with Athena.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks great, but I feel like it tastes
like Athena and not that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people get good results
with Athena, but it's not my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, however, so, you know,
we, right now we're running a veg blooms
[SPEAKER_00]: from hydroponic research and we like it
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we, we had this interesting
experience, you know, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Athena has that new product called fade
where they, you know, people, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people were complaining about how harsh
the weed was too much nitrogen at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you know, they sent some of
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried it out and we actually,
for the first time in a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be honest, like they said,
you know, plan health at the ends,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the problem with the hydroponic
growing is the flush, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course we all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant starts eating itself and Kim
dog is like, it's like that times 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it gets bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, it's kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to get your pictures on day
56, you know, um, maybe even a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, it starts to eat itself
and starts to consume itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, we've been like, you know,
getting some data from, uh, leaf analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: at different points of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're delving into that to kind of see
like when, at what point does these things
[SPEAKER_00]: start to become consumed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like what we, what day they
start to get consumed and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what can we do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're doing this, we know we're
fucking around with calcium and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things and, um, you know,
not really a lot of success, maybe some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, somewhat something notable,
uh, but we did run their fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say, I don't want to do like an
ad here, but we did run it and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: looked green and healthy at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when I say green,
they had, you know, a lot, a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't like brown eating leaves is
what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like, I know they,
they recommended, we did what they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we went all the way through,
probably gave them fresh water for three
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, this shit's going to
burn bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to fucking hurt us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the thing, the first thing I
noticed, we didn't even have one little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny speck of atrius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always have it, you know,
the, but when the big buds, I always have
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit like it's not, you know,
it always occurs in those last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it always occurs in those last
seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the, in the mind, it's like,
well, of course it does, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants not growing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of finishing out,
you know, the mold's always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spores are always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you try to keep them out,
but there's, they get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so in your mind, you're like,
well, of course, you know, that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we actually didn't have any,
and it was like, Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caught me off guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they didn't mention that when they
talked to me about it, when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: asking me to try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so then what we did is we,
we switched back over to, uh, we did one
[SPEAKER_00]: with the veg bloom program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just stuck with the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do anything too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added some, some gypsum in some calcium
carbonate and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overloaded with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, um, those things are a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they didn't, I don't see the results
that I hear about with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I see some result, but the impact
is not as what I hear it's in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then, you know, we had a little
bit to try this and yada yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then eventually we smoked that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we only gave it plain water for days
as smooth as smooth can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing now is we're going to
do the cutting edge four part,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, soluble powder system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then we're going to switch over in
the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like uncle John.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they got a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the, the flavor at the end of the
day, I'm a flavor guy and I want my way to
[SPEAKER_01]: taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in a cocoa type environment,
it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was talking about what I used
to run before, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the base with many other things
to kind of enhance it, but that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always so happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, uncle John and they're
good folks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they get it, you know, like,
you know, there's a reason why I can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I actually, I'm,
I'm okay with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't go to the big distributor to
have, they're like, nah, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll be smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't be able to reach everybody,
but at least we'll stay more true to our
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I do like being part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, then that's what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but however, we're going to,
um, we are going to try that just one way
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done that one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try that all the way
through once and just see what the results
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, but really, I think what our
strategy is going to end up being is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to leave that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last two weeks, we're just
going to do bloom and fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you know, that's kind of why I
tried it out, but this, the fade stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, it works like the smoke was
smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smooth can be, we still had all the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think we're going to be able to
do them better when we, when we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and match, we don't run just one
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just take what's what works and we
apply it when it needs to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it needs to be used, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's kind of our strategy
that the long story short is that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: try to think outside the box, understand
what we're doing, you know, never ever do
[SPEAKER_00]: something without knowing why you're doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think that's a big problem out
there is like, this is what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, but why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something goes wrong, do you know
what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if something starts to go a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to enhance the turps,
you know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, are you trying to, you know,
different strains require different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, nutrient, you know,
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we, that's kind of,
you know, where our strategy is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like to, I guess that's what I've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer to that is, you know,
we're just trying to mix and match and
[SPEAKER_00]: find what works with us, but Athena fades
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing stories like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to, uh, with all the,
all the knowledge that you've gathered
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years and you were to go talk to
your younger self that had been doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: for about two years, what piece of advice
would you give yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first piece of advice that is
still stands true today that I did get
[SPEAKER_00]: was, uh, never, ever, ever think you
haven't figured out, never, ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: ever, um, speak when someone else is
telling you something, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if someone's sharing what their
experiences and their knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they've been growing for one year and
they have it, you should still listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're probably still going to learn
something from the minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the way it was presented to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you think you have it all
figured out is the minute you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start failing because you know,
your confidence and let's just say ego and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've made it by yourself now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, that advice still rings true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I always remember that, yeah,
I have learned a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I surely have, but that doesn't mean I
can't learn something from someone much
[SPEAKER_00]: younger than me and less experienced for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had to give myself advice then I
would say share what you've learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like as you learn things,
be more open about it, share it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, that's pretty much it
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, I don't really have a
great answer for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was a great answer to be
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like it was, it's,
it's, it's been difficult for me to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've had a hard time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we, of course we were
growing cannabis, of course that could get
[SPEAKER_00]: you in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also involved with some other
crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, it w there was a
culture of like, you got to keep your lips
[SPEAKER_00]: sipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to like, you know, walk the line,
don't let anyone know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I, I went years,
people, good friends, close friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: come to my house and they would be,
you know, they buy weed from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get Tupperware's super skunk and Kim
dog from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew I was growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never would hear me admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they would, they stopped asking
me like, do you grow this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, I told you, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't ask me that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that a little too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and I would have, if I had
anything to change about my somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: younger self, I would have, I would have
made that decision sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, the law enforcement did that for
me, you know, ironically, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they came and rated me in 2014,
well, they took everything from me,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants included.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got arrested for like nine felonies,
you know, manufacturing controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance all the way down to possession
with the intent and control, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: man possession of concentrated cannabis,
you know, you know, and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing of a controlled substance
being the most serious of those crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very serious crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it carries a potential of seven years
in the penitentiary in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they had every in their
mind, they had every right to take my life
[SPEAKER_00]: away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did a very, very good job at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, my daughter was living
with me more than half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She, I had more, her custody was,
with me more than 50% of the time because
[SPEAKER_00]: her mom worked a lot more than I,
you know, I worked at home because I had
[SPEAKER_00]: grows around the County and down at
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had more flexible schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the reason why, but that all
suddenly ended the day they came and
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked the door in, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the doors at once, you know,
and so, you know, my life changed quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: and rapidly, and it seemed like a kick in
the nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it was, but it didn't take
me too long after that to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually done me a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a hamster wheel that was going
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was just working my ass off to
pay the bills so I could grow another
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, you know, and, you know,
maybe, I mean, I was having a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we were making money,
but, you know, but the bottom line is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, I was working too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the beginning of the end for that
lifestyle, I guess you could say in
[SPEAKER_00]: California at least, and really everywhere
now, probably most places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it allowed me to forcefully,
you know, put me in a different position
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was like, well, what now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and, and then that's when I
started to say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I'm going to focus on,
on making good genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sharing with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask me that, you know,
for clones and for genetics and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for seeds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just seemed like an opportunity
all of a sudden and just get through the
[SPEAKER_00]: probation, get through all the things that
I had to do, the community service and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that they make you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, all the sleepless nights
of, Oh my God, I'm still growing weed up
[SPEAKER_00]: in a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they know where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not that I told them, but they
know where I live and they could come any
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so lots of stress and,
you know, I'm, I'm actually grateful that
[SPEAKER_00]: it happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was hard and, you know,
losing everything that you've worked for
[SPEAKER_00]: in a flash is nothing, not never going to
be easily accepted or it's never going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's like, but these opportunities
give us chances to start over and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they, they really help you learn
who you, who you really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think everything in life,
I think things happen for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen too many things in life
to know that things in life happen for a
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have setbacks and, you know,
that there's, there's always ups and downs
[SPEAKER_01]: and that, you know, if you're up,
there's always going to be times where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're down, there's always going
to be times where you're up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't appreciate one or the other,
you know, without the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to have that contrast,
you know, and.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, when you're doing what
we do, like sitting around, feeling sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself is, it ain't going to work
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to keep on moving,
but it was, it was humbling because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I was, you know, 40 something
and I'm 50 now is 40 something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, now I'm around all my
friends who I've been giving cuts to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Oh my God, I lost the Kim dog
cut again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're building like businesses and
you're over here going, you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was humbling, it was hard and the
character building really like I got back
[SPEAKER_00]: to my roots about who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the things about me who that I was
starting not to like, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those things were not important anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they weren't part of who I
was suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was grateful for that, like truly
grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like you said,
it's like one thing leads to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that I'm in Bozeman,
Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the last grace place on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just doesn't get it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get any better than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk, you know, 10 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my hot springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 20 minutes away I've got like
the most beautiful hike that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want, I can go 25 miles out into the
wilderness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to bring your bear mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mooses are the most dangerous animals
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, I mean, it's heaven on
earth and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so without that event happening to me
in 2014, I wouldn't be sitting here and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fully aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not been a moment where I
wasn't aware of it and I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on the hardest of days, I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's contrast, you know,
it's how you appreciate life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you appreciate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you not become bored and
complacent is by having things in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life that have happened that you can look
back and go, man, I can't believe I went
[SPEAKER_00]: through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still, I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you get knocked down,
you get back up and you keep working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, I've had bouts of
depression through my life or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think the biggest thing for me is
just to keep working and keep driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have a lot of work life
balance with what I do right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I I'm okay with that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't either at all, but I mean,
I live in the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have built an apartment here because,
you know, it's what I had to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like going out and it's very
expensive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't understand that this
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, Tom Brady lives here,
you know, like Bill Gates lived here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it's a very, very wealthy
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, buying or renting a
house around here is, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to take a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I live here and I don't mind
it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being near my plants, I get up,
my dispensaries, my living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where I sit and watch popcorn and
watch my TV show, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it ain't that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you love what you do, man,
it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk for a second about how
everybody could find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're looking for seeds or they're
looking, you know, genetic seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're looking for flour, where can
they find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best source we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's www.luckydogcannabisco.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have on that website, you know,
we have our flour menu, we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated flour menu about what we have
daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have, you know,
like if we ever had a strain, even if we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't keep it, we'll still keep the
photos in the library there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just discontinued because,
you know, we're not going to try to forget
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that doesn't mean it was,
you know, we lose a thing every now and
[SPEAKER_00]: again, we've lost two strains since we've
had other people besides me taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, luckily nothing too crazy,
but it happens a little mix up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a whole nother section on
the seed side of it, where you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors that sell Lucky Dog Seed Company
seeds and, you know, learn a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a fun thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My cultivator, his name is Eli,
but he goes by gingergrower on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of famous, you know,
but so he's the cultivator here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like my right-hand man when it comes
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky because we see eye to eye,
like we totally, we don't ever like see
[SPEAKER_00]: things differently, which, you know,
is amazing really, when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you know, like he understands that
the plants are living creatures like our
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs and cats and our loved ones and that
they need to be taken care of accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that I could have found,
and I'm so lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't anything I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pure luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who cares so much about it to the
point where I don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I can't be part of that process and
that happens when I'm running this
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a hard part for me,
letting go of that somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I trust him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a new thing where we go out on
that trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about the Cottonwood,
South Cottonwood trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a new blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just popped in our head.
[SPEAKER_00]: We walk out about, it's about three miles
out to this rock by the Gallatin river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take one of our pre-rolls,
just one of our strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go out there, me, him and my dog,
El Toro, and we smoke it and we just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of record our experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to be vocal about, you know,
how we feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have to be just,
okay, this strain and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how cannabis it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were talking earlier, it can kind
of invoke a thought or a memory or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing it every Sunday
before the shop opens because we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get back to the shop because on Sunday
it's just me and him working here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to run the counter and he has to
go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's doing his plant thing,
but we do this first and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, some pictures, we could be
talking about dogs or flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to base it around a strain
every week, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you can come there and enjoy
that with us if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear with me as I get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would say that's the central,
we're trying to make that the central spot
[SPEAKER_00]: for the seed company and everything,
lucky dog cannabis, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I really appreciate you coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done one of these with the
video and I'm doing all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to have you come out to the
studio, come check out the facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: see what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe line up a collaboration at some
point, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll be down there actually pretty
soon, like in this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to hang out, I'd be happy
to, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some killer flower to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I was telling my girlfriend,
she owns Breeders Direct Seed Company and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking, she was like, who's James
Loud?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, he's been breeding
cannabis for a while and he's had a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I knew about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's made a lot of things,
a lot of amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, I said,
but to me, the thing that I like about
[SPEAKER_00]: your feed or your social media thing is if
you want to know about actual seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production or if you want to know actual
seed production on a scale and what it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes, and even what I mean by that is
making the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that complicated to make seeds,
but on scale, it can be rather
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated, especially when you're doing
feminize, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually learned a lot from you
about scaled up seed production,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm fascinated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kudos for that, I got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've learned a lot from you,
truly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a breeding book coming out that
should be out by Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working on it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been over five years and it's really
detailed and it really has a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some of the best people besides
myself, some of the best people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that have contributed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super excited to have it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll definitely be giving you a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember reading about that at some
point somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there isn't a lot of that out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not a lot of books about
breeding period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do we got botany?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, I think the Cannabis
Breeders Bible, it's it's outdated,
[SPEAKER_01]: though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the that was twenty five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, around the time Jerry passed,
I think that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So twenty three years ago, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything from that time can be outdated
because, you know, the information was so
[SPEAKER_00]: limited, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like tissue culture is a great example
that like we're delving deep into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been under I've been working
under a hood for a long time doing other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to actually be teaching
tissue culture classes in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California, hopefully starting right
around the New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, life is so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get everything done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to be teaching classes
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a like a rather large house near
Disneyland that my girlfriend owns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to turn the garage into
like a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it already is a lab now,
but like a lab where we can teach,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can, you know, have companies or
individuals of all types come out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's like a bed and
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stay five days, you four days hands
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a day off in the middle to go to
the beach or, you know, go enjoy the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want, Disneyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you stay there, we're going to
feed you, you know, amazing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like paradise, you know, and so it's
going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the next thing we're doing,
you know, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like I think to solve the problem
of some of the pathogens and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, hoplating is the one the
buzzword now and it should be a serious
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more coming, you know,
like, oh, yeah, there's so many more
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's systemic bacteria and there's
so much, you know, it's like we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture lab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do mirror stem excision.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, yeah, we have, we have basically
clean tests for, we have dirty tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we have clean tests with our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: My partner, Justin Givens does some
amazing work and yeah, I'm all about
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, it's a, it's a, it's a good
answer to a really shitty problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, but the thing, and it's,
we were talking about the outdated book
[SPEAKER_00]: and it made me think of it as like,
so, you know, like tissue culture is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around since the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every book you do buy, as you know,
comes from tissue culture, but people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the first time I got turned on
to it, someone handed me a tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: kit from, uh, uh, the guy, yeah,
Graham, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, here, take this,
go figure it out and tell me what this is
[SPEAKER_00]: good for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I did, it was like 2006
pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have things, nodal tissue culture going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think we called it that at
the point, just tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's like, what's it good for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, honestly, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you wanted to take a plant to
Barcelona, this would be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, and then the answer for
all of our problems was right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, well, not all our
problems, but some of our problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, now was right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily I got a little hands on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, I was actually excited to
know like, Oh man, I'm going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to have a tissue culture
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I love doing lab work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being under the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sterile environments and I,
you know, like creating them and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in order for us to get through
this, we're going to have to do more than
[SPEAKER_00]: a few of us offering clean stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to actually show
people that this is the protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you don't spread it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you do the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're learning all these things
in real time, but more importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what you can do to cure something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you know what you know,
what, what I know, if I can share that
[SPEAKER_00]: with you and if you can apply that,
you know, you don't have to throw that
[SPEAKER_00]: very rare cultivar away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can maybe save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an opportunity here, you know,
or, or just keeping it clean in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were talking about systemic
pathogens, just nodal tissue culture helps
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, all these things,
like if you don't grow roots for months,
[SPEAKER_00]: then eventually those pathos, systemic
pathogens in the root system, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually going to, they have no food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go somewhere else,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I was going to mention one more
thing that a lucky dog, a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had another drop, a drop today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've been working on this particular
drop since January with the testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting everything ready and selecting,
uh, making sure we have what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to let everybody know that
if you go to our website, www
[SPEAKER_00]: .luckydogcannabisco.com and you go through
the seed page, you can see all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors that will be carrying our drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those vendors should have all those
next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, stuff like dog beach, Virginia beach,
Afghani crossed with the chem dog and pole
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, skunk dog crossed with the,
uh, with the chem dog as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many, many others we have 11,
11 to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several are unfortunately rather limited,
but, uh, pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all the photos and we're selling a
lot of the product here at the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, uh, worth a look see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really appreciate your time today,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to seeing you in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too, bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to like and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
