[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James lab podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: and today my special guest is Sam from
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, James?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thank you so much for coming on the
show We've been planning this for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time since Mila was on the show So if you
guys follow along Mila was on the one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the first episodes So we've been talking
about getting you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met thanks to Mila.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did Yeah, glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you have a Interesting line of
different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you you got a new vape that you
guys are doing you have the Carta You guys
[SPEAKER_01]: you have rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have all kinds of amazing stuff
Yeah, we definitely we do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things in the industry But yeah
show companies the brands that we operate
[SPEAKER_00]: our rosin tech labs focus V And then we
just opened a dispensary in New Jersey
[SPEAKER_00]: called hashery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so how does it feel to be so busy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not gonna complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, you know, yeah But it's a
wearing a lot of different hats,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, yeah, I mean you guys Create a
lot of good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you have an emphasis on
quality whether it's the packaging or the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's in the product I feel like
Some people miss one of them across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board and I feel like you really have an
emphasis on Quality across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everything we do is really centered
around hash So show stands for solvent
[SPEAKER_00]: less hash oil for those like who may know
of show companies but not know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: show stands for and Yeah, quality is
definitely, you know in everything that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do rosin text premium hash brand last year
We released a lot of new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually started the year with with
only selling hash and then Expanded the
[SPEAKER_00]: product line to include We released a hash
hole last year our hash walkers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are like a six pack of indoor flower
with ice water hash and then we have Rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, your hash hole was the best hash
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked last year out of every I smoked a
lot of households, but that was the best
[SPEAKER_01]: one I wish I could have gotten another one
That's when you have good one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might spark one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was really good I feel like the
flavor was there and it had just the long
[SPEAKER_01]: finish, you know, it's like the hash holes
at the end of the day are about effect and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor and Definitely check the boxes
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're they're definitely a labor
of love, you know, each one is is
[SPEAKER_00]: hand-rolled we put a lot of Work into the
tip too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like really what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Creates the shape of the joint is what
style tip you use, you know, right the
[SPEAKER_00]: glass tip It keeps the shape kind of a
certain size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and creates good airflow Yeah,
I mean I've done a bunch of R&D on
[SPEAKER_01]: different tips and I've been I've kind of
settled on that Organotips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the organotips for myself
for smoking but Yeah, the glass it's
[SPEAKER_01]: they're kind of elegant too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are a little heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that It's like a reuse
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reuse them recyclable and
reusable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a box of a thousand of them
Thinking that I was gonna do this pre-roll
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just never amounted to anything and
then I switched the organotips,
[SPEAKER_01]: but For personals for personals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got two different sizes and yeah,
they're nice So tell me how you got your
[SPEAKER_00]: start in the industry So show was founded
in 2015 and if you remember at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: that was when rosin first hit the scene so
soil-grown solventless started pressing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of his ice water hash with a hair
straightener and It kind of caught on on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone started to realize there was this
new method of making hash with heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure and so the first product line
that we Introduced was a line of presses
[SPEAKER_00]: that was in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well It was kind of crazy, you know,
like Everyone was interested in this tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was you know solventless way to make a
dabble bull product which previous didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: dab right wasn't You know, it left,
you know, it left residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean and the thing is is I love bubble
hash I've loved I mean I was I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking bubble hash since the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love it today You know nicotine
guys like nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of elevated the bubble hash game
I think to a degree but bubble hash Wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: the same as all the other things you could
dab and it's hard to come across six-star
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble hash, you know, absolutely as far
as dabble bull products rosin introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: and and opened the market up so that there
was way more like Range of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we I mean at least for us and what
we're seeing in the market right now It's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been interesting like fresh press has
become like not as popular in the market
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone in California at least in the
rec market is is gravitating gravitating
[SPEAKER_00]: towards cold cures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's mainly what we're putting out
right now is just because that's what the
[SPEAKER_00]: market Wants is a lot of cold cures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that moist kind of consistency is like
what we're primarily putting out even with
[SPEAKER_00]: ice water hash Like we're not we we used
to kind of like every quarter We would you
[SPEAKER_00]: know find a strain that really was like
good for ice water hash product But we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been we've been putting everything through
the press and primarily putting out all
[SPEAKER_01]: cold cures nice So yeah So tell us a
little bit about cold cure the process for
[SPEAKER_01]: it because I think a lot of we have a lot
of breeders We have a lot of other people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are curious About dabs and extract
and kind of the processes if you can walk
[SPEAKER_01]: us through some of the different processes
that you guys doing Yeah, so I mean with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, we're taking fresh press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Washing the material first then we put
it through our freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, then we press it Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, starting with the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cultivator grows it When it's ready to
be harvested gets chopped immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing it and then transporting it down
to us frozen stays You know frozen all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way through the process washing it in
super cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that super cold water is You know
agitating and it's acting basically as the
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent to separate the trichome head from
the frozen plant material and then passing
[SPEAKER_00]: that through micron screens And separating
it from the plant material and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have like a wet hash, right you In the
past you would let it air dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then people started using
freeze dryer Harvest rights harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's yeah, that's what we use and put
it through the the freeze dryer That's
[SPEAKER_00]: typically like a 24-hour 36-hour process
some good tech that's still evolving with
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures in the freeze dryer and and
different ways to kind of run your cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: because The operator is not there a lot,
you know, you're not just watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze dryer the whole time So you you
know, we've started to use this app hashy
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can pull your Data from your
freeze dryer and really kind of see the
[SPEAKER_00]: the heating cycle in the in the unit Make
sure that it's doing what it says it's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing But then for cold cure, it's you
know, we use a mation jar and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it at approximately like 76
degrees cold cure It's just letting time
[SPEAKER_00]: do its thing Can range depending on the
strain some strains are more stubborn to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn over but anywhere from three days is
Really quick, um to as long as like a week
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do you know by the way it looks or how
do you identify once it's ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you'll see like the that kind of top
turf layer separate and um, then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of whip it up It's kind of somewhat
of a feeling, you know, kind of when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fully separated and and kind of ready
Awesome that ice water you I saw I think a
[SPEAKER_01]: video last year of you guys doing cold
plunges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah i'm a big cold plunge fan and so I
saw that i'm like, yeah this guy i'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: happy working at that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good time We actually
bought that to transport fresh frozen We
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been we've been actually just
using uh, like a regular chest freezer to
[SPEAKER_00]: transport most of the time But uh,
we bought that to transport fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_00]: with dry ice and uh, so I was just sitting
there We're like, all right, maybe we
[SPEAKER_00]: could like put this to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump in Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all the employees jumped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys look like you had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good team building It's good team
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we try to keep things fun,
you know working in manufacturing is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely It's tough, you know,
and it's like a daily grind You got to hit
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and you know hit a certain quota
every day and um a lot of repetitive tasks
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool because we care about the
quality of the product And so I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it more interesting for everybody
But right well, then you get people that
[SPEAKER_01]: want to work there They work there they
work there because they're passionate you
[SPEAKER_01]: want passionate people working for you and
I feel like That's just the best way with
[SPEAKER_01]: with employees if you have people that are
just as passionate as you are about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that are Experts in whatever they
do or they they learn how to do that to
[SPEAKER_01]: their the best of their ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always great Yeah, you need some
passion in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're if you're not passionate like
you probably left the industry You're
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably already gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not gone, you're gonna be
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah, it's just it's so tough The
industry isn't what it used to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I think there was a lot of people
in it for the money and now There's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people that are in it for the passion
that are saying I'm not going anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else Yeah, it's kind of like the flip side
of the coin with you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that the industry has it's kind
of allowed kind of people that are true to
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and the plant and who really
care about it to You know grind it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, keep out some of the the chads and
some of the you know financial guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: really don't care that much and they're
just trying to make make a buck Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's interesting how it's changed The last
five years because during kovat everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm doing cannabis cannabis is
crushing and now it's like you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: because you love it and you're doing it
because you You're doing it for the long
[SPEAKER_01]: play and not the quick money But yeah,
and even the award ceremonies and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that is you know, they change from
high times to emerald cup is You know now
[SPEAKER_01]: a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's there's a lot of awards,
but there's not as many prestigious awards
[SPEAKER_00]: I think yeah, I know I mean emerald cup
has you know done their award ceremony for
[SPEAKER_00]: at least like Two decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would think something along those
decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a great job, you know And they're
really connected to like the cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: and the community and the cultivators and
they're they're really in it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim's Tim's done a good job with emerald
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep So and there was a time where high
times was on top and those high times cups
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day were amazing Especially
the first US ones were it was something
[SPEAKER_01]: new and the people were so excited to be
there everybody was having an amazing time
[SPEAKER_01]: and Everybody did really well that was
selling products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a good product, it was easy to
sell Yeah, the high times cannabis cups
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were we started going to them in
2016 and we did we would set up like a 50
[SPEAKER_00]: by 50 booth Yeah, and it was branded the
solvent list experience and we had all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our rosin presses set up and people would
come in with flour or we would have a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: at our booth that would give people flour
yeah, and we would just teach them like
[SPEAKER_00]: what the process of making Rosin was so we
would allow them to press on the machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know collect the the rosin up put it
in a jar for them We would have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: dab breaks set up and let them like take a
dab So it was it was pretty cool Like I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a lot of people saw pressing for the
first time at one of our booths Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the old old high times cups had the
passionate people because you had to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: a destination location so if you're
American going in you you love weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was like disco though when it was
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gone high times It's it's changed
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company has changed the company has
changed the whole the whole landscape of
[SPEAKER_00]: the company has changed It has yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you really need to like work out
your business, you know to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant and keep it You know active and
yeah, I mean in high times they have this
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing name, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have the potential to do great
things They could they could do another
[SPEAKER_01]: high times event and it would probably be
cool if they did it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the equity that the brand still has
even after yeah, you know Maybe not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as they should have over the past
few years It's still a great brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's still part of the
culture and hopefully it's heavily that
[SPEAKER_01]: name is heavily tied to the culture You
know, and if you say high times to anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: that knows anything about weed,
they know what high times is exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's definitely like for like the
mass public mass market like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known brand still still Cookies now
the cookies is because they get kids
[SPEAKER_01]: little kids wearing cookies t-shirts,
you know, that's that trips me out by the
[SPEAKER_01]: way when you see little kids, you know
that are like four years old walking
[SPEAKER_01]: around with cookie shirts on and it's like
Sometimes you wonder does that kid
[SPEAKER_01]: actually know what cookies is or do the
parents know because sometimes Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty amazing though the the reach of
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're they're in a lot of markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a good job branching out into
ancillary So so do you guys do clothing
[SPEAKER_01]: yet or you just have your your submerged
hoodies hats and t-shirts?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, primarily Like we don't focus on
apparel, but for us ancillary is focus V.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like all the the Focus V products we
can ship them across state lines We don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to deal with like, you know licenses
in each state like we do with Rosentek,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice, you know allows us to
build a brand across state lines And even
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in other countries we sell a lot
of units and in Canada and in Europe and
[SPEAKER_00]: South America That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan I'm definitely a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a guy who used hot knives back in
the day So we went from Kohl's and hot
[SPEAKER_01]: knives to all the dab rigs and now we have
like yeah there was the e-nails and now
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all in one and I think That it's
amazing that we have gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've come so far and it's very
scientific and Very specific you can dial
[SPEAKER_01]: it down to the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that's It's a lot easier
to do that than on hot knives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's it's I mean, it's definitely
cool to see like the progress of Dabbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and just like where it started,
you know, we didn't really know what we
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing You know with what materials
titanium or what temperatures we were
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing at It's been it's definitely
evolved I think every year and gotten more
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated in terms of you know now
we're Like looking at complex airflow and
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah retention and all these kind of
things to to make it a better experience
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's really what it boils down
to is the experience we keep improving the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's something to be said
for hot knives, you know people still I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure do hot knife hits with hash and same
thing with you know, I feel like Quartz
[SPEAKER_01]: nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen one of those in a long time
But that's kind of where dab rigs started
[SPEAKER_01]: was with those quartz nails that we heat
up because they heat up real fast And then
[SPEAKER_00]: they went to titanium You've seen some of
the like slurpers that are on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: control tower highly educated control
tower with the the pillar that spins and
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just yeah I mean all kinds of
creative ways to get your hash to evenly
[SPEAKER_00]: spread around your heated, you know
surface, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's mind-blowing and then e pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've they've They've come a long way
since the gen one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the vape pens that started out the
you know, they half of them would go bad
[SPEAKER_01]: anytime Anyway, they're all made
manufacturing China natal wick and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this other stuff and they've really
improved on those and you have a New
[SPEAKER_01]: improved version as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean, it's it's kind of a good
segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's uh, so this is uh, this is Eris
and We just released it last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dry dab device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of amazing features
We packed a lot of technology into like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really small form factor But I like to
really describe it as it's like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time you can fit a dab Device in your
pocket and take a real dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well So it has the Intelli-core atomizer,
which is the same atomizer on the Carter 2
[SPEAKER_00]: It has removable batteries So you can if
you're going to a festival or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling or just want to have backup
juice And you don't want to run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a proprietary removable battery
Compatible atomizer and then this
[SPEAKER_00]: mouthpiece is really kind of what took us
the longest part longest time to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: and The challenge was like you have a
short amount of space here and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: heated atomizer So cooling the smoke as
it's like going into the user's Mouth and
[SPEAKER_00]: then like also moving the air around the
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has two carb holes on either side
the The way the air flows in it moves the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil around the atomizer And then it goes
through a longer air path on its way out
[SPEAKER_00]: to cool the smoke And it's got a ceramic
Insert piece that this pops out and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just dump that in ISO Wow,
super easy to clean Super durable like you
[SPEAKER_00]: could just throw this thing in your
backpack, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many hits do you get per charge?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around 10 to 12 similar to the Carter
2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure I'm big on R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I love I love R&Ding new things So
it's a serious part of the job There's
[SPEAKER_00]: some first-class funk from Luma Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, it's heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll Flash white when it's ready and then
these are two carb holes So if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just you told one one and yeah,
just hold it straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold the device straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh You're tapping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that was good good flavor So the
interesting thing with that flavor is It's
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things I like about certain
strains is when you take a hit of it you
[SPEAKER_01]: get an initial flavor Then when you exhale
you you get something on the finish that's
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different and you get the gas
the earth You get some pine in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean Yeah, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, that's a cool device Sick man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked really hard on it and there's
really nothing that like you can fit in
[SPEAKER_00]: your pocket like if I'm going out and I'm
like want to be able To dab I I got my
[SPEAKER_00]: saber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the heiress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a gram with me and that's it Like
I'm not a big festival time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't like like carrying a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: No me either I don't just like what I got
in my pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got friends they carry around,
you know Hard cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got their their cases with their
rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Set up for their ISO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah can't fly with torches by the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so do not Fly with torches where
I guess you could probably drain them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean they took it away from me But
they searched my bag and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh god, what are they gonna get now and so
I fly back and forth Between LA and Jersey
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I was flying home like two
months ago and Had my backpack like I had
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple grams of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some hash walkers So I had like four
or five of these these are joints nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I had our gummies and I had the
gummies just like straight up into My face
[SPEAKER_00]: pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like not in my bag or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put them on the conveyor belt and
so stop me DSA person came over was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is not allowed, you know,
like you have way too much product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow I was like, okay, like what what
are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's going on cops came over
like three three cops came over and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a red-eye flight so I was like Like
I'm not gonna be able to get a later
[SPEAKER_00]: flight like and then she she came over a
cop came over to me and she was like Do
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what the legal limit is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, you tell me and she's
like, no, you tell me what's the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: limit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, tell me what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so she's like it's 28 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, okay I like did some quick
math and like the the gummies are only 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per gummy Yeah, like that was
only like really two grams even though it
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the joints was really only like
it was like 12 or 15 grams So I like all
[SPEAKER_00]: added up to like 21 22 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went back like with her flashlights
Started to like add it up and she came
[SPEAKER_00]: back and she was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't always end good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I have some friends that have been
stopped lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So yeah, 28 grams you're not supposed
to fly with more than 28 grams even going
[SPEAKER_01]: medical to medical or License to license
state my view is kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know We should be pushing these
boundaries and like if that's how we got
[SPEAKER_01]: here like, you know, like so be it,
you know, I mean I got caught flying with
[SPEAKER_01]: samples from Colorado to California,
they stopped me and Pulled them out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag that it was a new person and they
pulled them out and they were all jarred
[SPEAKER_01]: up and they were all labeled and I was
Gonna go get them tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that much but there was a bunch
of jars and these were seeds or no This
[SPEAKER_01]: was flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we were doing yeah I was doing
some testing on this stuff because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to see the results but that never
worked out but what happened was they
[SPEAKER_01]: called the sheriff over and the sheriff
was like Yeah, I would let you fly with
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even care but the person lifted
out of the bag so there's all these people
[SPEAKER_01]: that saw that and so you can call your
friend and have them come pick it up or
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I can destroy it and So they
destroyed it because I need to catch my
[SPEAKER_01]: flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, and then I had him Also,
I'm just don't want to go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork that you know, and they don't
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care the edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny if you think of it,
you know, technically that that isn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: a product that needs to go through the DCC
if you look at it by by weight is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: below point three percent THC by Total
weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But uh, that's a big loophole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point Yeah,
because they're like our gummies are five
[SPEAKER_00]: grams like the weight of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and they only have ten
milligrams Yeah, that's way below.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's way below the point one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so but we can start shipping those
Technically technically by law under the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm bill that is a legal product to sell
as long as it's point three by weight
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all these smoke shops in New York
and and you know and a lot of Markets
[SPEAKER_00]: people are just you know, the THC a yeah
excuse is just doesn't have Delta 9 in it
[SPEAKER_01]: or it has a very little Yeah, I mean that
it's a big loophole right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's gonna get closed up,
but that's just my personal opinion I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like other people are saying it's legal
We're not excited about it either because
[SPEAKER_00]: like we just opened a store in New Jersey
and like down the block We got this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just got like, you know jars and
he's doing like the old-school like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know plucking like bull nugs out of
Like a jar and weighing it for people
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have like all this compliance and
packaging and taxes taxes and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the short term It could be a
good thing and that it forces like states
[SPEAKER_00]: or or the federal government to make some
changes I'm not opposed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not excited about it doesn't
excite me like genetics or like all this
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff the legal side of it never
excites me because it's like we've come so
[SPEAKER_01]: far and we still have a long ways to go
but you know, it's like we need interstate
[SPEAKER_01]: Commerce that's it's crazy that we don't
have interest at the very least Legal
[SPEAKER_01]: state to legal state interstate commerce
like that's not a thing like and I we're
[SPEAKER_01]: working on it to become a thing But also
banking banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's working on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know We don't band together enough
as an industry to push forward the change
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want to see and I mean I'm guilty
of Not doing enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like everybody could do more me
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard because we don't have the
resources that other industries have or
[SPEAKER_00]: other markets have where you know,
they can put together groups and well the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones who are lobbying are the ones that
have a lot of money to lobby against us
[SPEAKER_01]: against us Specifically in our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's rough There's not a lot of
money for lobbying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Mean there's some there's some people
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think we're doing a good thing
by talking about it today I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial to the whole world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot Of people that
don't understand it either and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA across the board as long as there's
less than point three percent Delta 9 THC
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA is a hundred percent legal according
to the farm bill federally legal so Pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, and I was in Texas not so
long ago during Christmas and they had
[SPEAKER_01]: flour and I was like I didn't smoke to the
THCA flour that sold in Texas
[SPEAKER_01]: over-the-counter taxed like a normal
product they had THCA flour uh-huh taxed
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10% sales tax, you know, it's pretty
wild That it got me high and it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: taste terrible It wasn't the best but I
would say it's probably comparable to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of stuff you find dispensaries
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see where it goes the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean there's like some rumblings
It feels like cuz it's an election year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna be a real interesting year
no matter what with the elections and with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else and I Mean, there's a lot
of people that want change We got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems here in California The system is
not good like the the the cannabis at
[SPEAKER_00]: least like saying, you know Focusing on
like just the system that they set up for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah is not working Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah tax is too high to make too much
sense to push product to the black market,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis shouldn't be taxed more than oil
more than alcohol more than cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it is taxed more than cigarettes
right crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean these are things they have to
change I think and like in New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're there that it's just sales tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no separate X size like there is
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow Like you have a local tax that you
have to pay as a retailer at least as a
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer versus California 27% it's hard
to work in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like their taxes It's hard to live in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to work in California They make
it a lot easier in other states
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately But how many states are you
guys in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So California and then Jersey as of like a
month ago So we're like, I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: officially like multi-state officially a
month ago but you know, definitely like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Different style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the brands that are doing
the good like good work You got to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them out into other markets and like it's
good to see some of these brands like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know going into Florida and some of
the East Coast markets because a lot A lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the East Coast markets they're lacking
Yeah some of the just culture that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: on the West Coast and some of the brands
because those markets were more limited at
[SPEAKER_00]: first and so it was a lot of Yeah,
like bigger MSOs that got established in
[SPEAKER_00]: those East Coast markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida is gonna be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm Who's like the way that they've set
it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, New Jersey is pretty limited on how
they set it up So when you said in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey, I'm thinking man, it's hard to get
in New Jersey It's not they didn't give
[SPEAKER_01]: out a ton of licenses or the There wasn't
a ton of access for licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, New Jersey's like right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's under 75 dispensaries Yeah,
so it's still limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more limited on the city side So the
state didn't limit like the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses that they're issuing but like
there's just of there's 650 towns in
[SPEAKER_00]: Cities in New Jersey and only a hundred
and fifty have said yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm to some form of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then we got New York who's just
Reeling and dealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just wild the whole Bodega the bodega
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's like we're making
money though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're making money money stimulating
the economy I guess but like the the
[SPEAKER_00]: groups that went in and like got licenses
and like because remember there was like
[SPEAKER_00]: that round where it was like only like
five groups got licenses and they all paid
[SPEAKER_00]: like 20 million dollars like it's tough
Yeah, it's tough to compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're that you're paying all that
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's interesting how it's evolved to
what it is because I don't think anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: saw this 20 years ago that it'd be like
this and I don't think When we look back
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years from now, this is gonna be how
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be completely different The
model is gonna be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna move away from gelato a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say I mean, I assume we're
gonna move away though is evolve Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: taste said, you know, all these things are
just like fashion and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They evolve flavor evolves people get so
burnt out and we're on the top 40s list
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, it's like whatever is popular
right now that might be popular for
[SPEAKER_01]: another month or two months or whatever
and then another gelato You know something
[SPEAKER_01]: similar is gonna hit that number one spot
and it's constantly rotating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean there's long term there's a
place for The really you know the top hits
[SPEAKER_01]: but right now it's definitely the top 40
So whatever yeah, and I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going towards washing two different
genetics that wash well Because ash is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely like started to steer genetics
and sure there's obviously like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that are good washers Yeah What
kind of genetics are you guys running?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know GMO is always a dumper But we
have like AMG sour that we just put out
[SPEAKER_00]: Piro Loco government oasis Some of the
how's the government?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not a huge fan of the flower,
but I do like the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's interesting I haven't smoked in
the terms of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know it washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no wash as well Yeah, it's
interesting, you know, like the honey
[SPEAKER_01]: bananas the banana condas and the banana
Oreos and all these things I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: wash really well and I like GMO But
there's a lot of stuff that's like GMO
[SPEAKER_01]: that I feel like isn't as good as GMO,
but it's like GMO And that's a burger the
[SPEAKER_01]: Donnie burgers out there and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's basically GMO Yeah,
like GMO across the GMO across the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a it's very GMO You know,
and I think a lot of stuff is like gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back to the gelato 33 runs,
whatever you want to call it We keep going
[SPEAKER_01]: away from that and keep going back to it
people still it's in high demand still the
[SPEAKER_01]: the term people are you know aiming for
and You know for a while you'll see the RS
[SPEAKER_01]: 11s on top and these other things that are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're really good, too But we
still gravitate back towards those main
[SPEAKER_01]: things instead of spreading out because
there's so much diversity in the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: we can go to any any flavor Profile that
you guys like we can go orange we can go
[SPEAKER_01]: and not just like if we look at citrus
There's like 20 different types of citrus
[SPEAKER_01]: because with every one there's like the
citrus rind of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the citrus blossom of that plant
There's the juice of that plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just the fruit and so for every
type of orange or lemon There's there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: variant of that and then you have the
environment Yeah, which is gonna bring out
[SPEAKER_00]: different attributes of each right kinetic
one then like chocolate There's every kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of chocolate you could imagine Out there,
you know, and it's like I I do like
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate turps to a degree something like
gorilla glue has some chocolatiness to it
[SPEAKER_01]: Chocolope has some chocolatiness to it and
that can go all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: too And I'm a huge fan of Ruby chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've had Ruby chocolate
before It's like the it's just like white
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate, but it's a Ruby chites another
natural chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good What are your thoughts on
skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do I enjoy it skittles flower
skittles rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love skittles everything I pretty much I
love the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was talking more on the hash side
Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best one of the best
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really it has a long finish It's
candy tastes like candy and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of like expressions of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm on the hash side So yeah,
and that's another one So like we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out like what day do you harvest
on skittles is an early finisher?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to harvest on day 53 or day 55
or something really early?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some of the other stuff you want
to go to mature a little bit more for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: and that also Has it you know,
it has an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like going longer is you might get a
different effect than you would get by
[SPEAKER_01]: going earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Changes the the effect totally
changes the effect totally changes it
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with skittles if you go to day
63 It gets you it's way stronger,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the taste isn't as candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as amazing Not that it's not
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not as good as the early one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm So yeah, it's really interesting
what we've picked up on over the last,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know 30 years And then what we still
have to learn is there's so much to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: still so even techniques joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm down this is a wedding cake
flower Times GMO with wedding cake ice
[SPEAKER_00]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but these are yeah, these are 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow Mini's yeah ice water hash mixed
in with the flower indoor flower a little
[SPEAKER_00]: later looks like a beady Rippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, you get a couple hits
and you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like big three-point Five-gram
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my you should light up the actual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah There's nothing wrong with BDs they
they're nostalgic for me I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember they had different flavored
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like little mini cigarettes and
they had different flavors back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know ash holes are great
But in the middle of a day to take a hash
[SPEAKER_00]: hole to the to the dome is it's gonna
knock me out Yeah, I think the hash holes
[SPEAKER_01]: are more for the evening I like big big
joints, but it's This is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already getting some Oil on there
starting to drip already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean this yeah, the size is interesting
Yeah, we smoked like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we rolled them longer shorter a good size
Yeah Yeah, you're getting a little drip
[SPEAKER_02]: little oil that's good it looks nice The
flavor is good flavors good flavors Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's consistent too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Like it when it doesn't go away right
away a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on a living soil
versus Cocoa versus hydro I mean from what
[SPEAKER_00]: we from the farms we work with the ones
that are doing living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a greater expression of Like
the genetic I feel I find you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's just like another level of
quality In terms of how that like plant
[SPEAKER_00]: how healthy it is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like kind of what you're getting
out of the the trichome Yeah, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things I got to go right,
you know, there's a lot of things you
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta go right soil, too It's a lot of
other parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just just growing in general You're
living 70 days of a plant's life have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be great for you to have great flower You
have one day it could throw your whole
[SPEAKER_01]: crop off one day, but one bad day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it So stacks with a bunch of days
and you can correct a lot of things if you
[SPEAKER_01]: Recognize them before their problems But
still there's a lot of things that have to
[SPEAKER_01]: go right and there's a lot of variables a
lot of micro variables But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan of living so it's especially for
the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I'm all about the effect With
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I friends to get great flavor
using cocoa Doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge fan of Rock wool for flour
for flavor but moving away from the rock
[SPEAKER_01]: wool and there's some have been moving
away and then some guys are going full
[SPEAKER_01]: Force into it and same thing hydroponics,
you know, you talk about aquaponics like
[SPEAKER_01]: DWC the deep water culture and I've had a
couple guys on my show that do it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have really good flower too and You know,
but it's if you care about it and you put
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of energy into it, you know good
energy I think you're gonna end up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: good product when you cultivated in the
past was it indoor or mostly indoor and I
[SPEAKER_01]: did I mean I do outdoor to the outdoor
with soil with organics thanks to Brian
[SPEAKER_01]: vital by the way for the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy But yeah in indoor I like
cocoa for breeding I do you know for for
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically use cocoa For my mom's I use
rock wool and for my clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use rock and that's the sterile side of
it I try to be as sterile as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: giving that plant is much of an
opportunity to be clean and healthy and
[SPEAKER_01]: There's anything wrong with soil and cocoa
is great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do cocoa for this stuff,
too But like soil there's bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a nursery, I think using a
Soil is not necessarily the right choice
[SPEAKER_01]: for me if I had a nursery and some people
do it really well, but for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like It's an environment if you're
going with soil living soil like you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain that environment and like that
Ecosystem if it goes out of whack,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, you know problem Yeah, and it's
like well, there's so many things if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're selling clones to people that
you're expected You know, you're supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to have clean clones They need to be virus
free not everybody does this either But I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like those are the standards that
people should have if they're selling
[SPEAKER_01]: clones They should be clean of bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't have pests or pathogens
those are the two like no-no's because
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're Bucking up the world and
you're making it a worse place when you
[SPEAKER_01]: could be making it a better place by
taking a couple Important steps to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there and also if you're selling clones
like you're shipping it somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably into a new environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So could be introducing something that's
fine in your environment, but not wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: you're shipping it to exactly So and then
you get all kinds of problems with that
[SPEAKER_01]: international scenes you guys are selling
Cartas and all that stuff international.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so yeah focus V.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carter is Eris saber all those products
and so yeah internationally Spain will be
[SPEAKER_00]: at a spandibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll be there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bringing my books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my books That'll be there and we'll
be doing autographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be at the greenhouse nice and you're
working with Yeah, we'll be With Moxie and
[SPEAKER_00]: Moxie over there booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but yeah spandibus one of my
favorite events of the year, you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: love spandibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the event just the energy
everybody's like you're transported to it
[SPEAKER_00]: like a new place to like you're You're
there for like days, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you get like into it and an energy and
a vibe while you're there It's got the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheers vibe too So it's like the people
that you see if you go every year You know
[SPEAKER_01]: the same people and you see you're looking
for your friends and some of them like I
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't seen my friends in Spain a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I go a couple times a year at
least You know and during kovat and those
[SPEAKER_01]: times I was doing stuff and it was like I
was over there Quite a bit and then this
[SPEAKER_01]: last year it's been a year So I miss some
of my good friends that live over there
[SPEAKER_01]: and live in a great city It is the food is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people are amazing It's just that the
energy and the social aspect because there
[SPEAKER_01]: is the social aspect of it the I don't
have here here I go to bed and I wake up
[SPEAKER_01]: early over there I stay up late and I get
it, you know, I wake up pretty early too
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have events and new stuff But
you stay up late and you go to dinner at
[SPEAKER_01]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't even socialize They're like
go to dinner drink wine like hang out talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to each other Seriously, I quit eating
dinner at like seven o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we get to smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you got some good stuff households
Seeing the our gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not seen the gummies Rosin gummies
are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like rosin gummies are stronger
Than more like full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean for sure like a distillate
gummy So these Don't have any added
[SPEAKER_00]: flavoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like really that's what you're
tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How aren't these are 10 milligrams?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to try these later.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like nice big gumdrops It's
interesting because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of the cookie cutter gummies
or the the ones that come on the the press
[SPEAKER_01]: where they have like a machine that
doesn't but I like these they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: homemade feel to them Feels a little more
boutique than just the cookie cutter
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, but it's a nice thing to drop like
gumdrop shape Yeah, it's a nice like
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of gummy, you know, you don't want
like too small of a gummy No, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: cuz you're paying for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't there's value in the size of
the gummy for whatever that matters
[SPEAKER_01]: Something when you have to be something
substantial, you know Yeah, I Was in drops
[SPEAKER_00]: nice the ash hole Let's park this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a Booney Acres rosin Strawberry
mimosa and ember ember valleys a point
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice was the flower So we're doing this a
little bit backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did I start smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started smoke like my first joint I
smoked in in seventh grade Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like the first time I smoked weed
with so Cal or where did you grow Jersey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice of Jersey Jersey makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, my I took some weed from my
pops and like that's what we were smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: on like 70% of the people that I interview
It's like yeah got some for my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my older brother stuff like that
Yeah, my parents were pretty pretty cool
[SPEAKER_00]: with that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had older siblings, too I'm one of
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have three brothers and three older
sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was like Smoking and doing other
other things as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah How was the weed back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually pretty good He was getting
some weed like from New York like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know He had like some dude in New York
that was it was getting like who I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know where he was getting it from But I it
was probably like indoor New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah our California stuff probably could
have been so maybe yeah, but so the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics back in the day before cookies
What were what were your top picks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like like back in the day like I I
was just everything was numbered hit by
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was like Whenever no before
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before 2012 do you smoke before 2012?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, but I was never like this is my
favorite strain just being like real with
[SPEAKER_00]: you Yeah, like I knew coming onto your
show like I would get that question Like
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was like younger and growing up
like we like like we were just smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the fuck we were smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah What were your favorite
genetics when you were a cat piss cat piss
[SPEAKER_01]: cat piss was the favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like cat piss is coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had some we're doing a
documentary on cat piss That's how much I
[SPEAKER_01]: like it and I've got some people involved
Well, my friend Jason has his cut but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the same cut that we had and I found
out because we had the This thing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bay Area cat piss was so big and this is
gonna be a lot of controversy for the show
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of cat piss is out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not just one I think a lot of
stuff with ammonia is cat piss Like people
[SPEAKER_01]: call it cat piss because it has that that
Aroma and so when it hits the nose,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ammonia piss They you know,
it's not like calling something blue dream
[SPEAKER_01]: where somebody else would take that name
and associated with blue dream There's not
[SPEAKER_01]: an association with aroma So with the
documentary we're gonna dive into the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of the cat piss that I know and
then also different smells of Ours was
[SPEAKER_00]: people consider to be cat piss ours was
more of a super silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was super silver haze In the one
that I remember that my friends grew one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the guys that's working with me now,
his name is Matt He used to grow cat piss
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time And so we've researched it
and I've got a hold of a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: people that we were friends with we
figured out exactly what the cross was
[SPEAKER_01]: which is definitely different and this was
a longer flowering variety that was You
[SPEAKER_01]: know 12 to 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some of the guys that have the cat
other cat piss varieties those are very
[SPEAKER_01]: short flowering and so the aroma can
express in different things, but yeah Cat
[SPEAKER_01]: piss was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had you know, if I think of way back we
had Maui waui that was amazing We had some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that there was stuff that was just
called purple bud That was like fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: purple and there was like the Maui waui is
like yellow velvety bud That was really
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we had a I grown up in the Bay
Area We had access to all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was always different strains
We did have droughts too, but there was
[SPEAKER_01]: people growing in their garages and
closets and before warehouses everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: was growing in their closets or garages
Romulan was a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like if you talk about before cookies,
there was so much stuff there was even
[SPEAKER_01]: before tangy if we talk about like You
know some of the oranges there was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely some really oranges Some of the
the great real skunky weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never called it roadkill skunk,
but it was skunky It was like skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they call it strawberry and we picked
it up in Santa Cruz And it was called
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry because it was strawberry sized
nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm, but it was skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Skunk like like sprayed skunk
smell like super strong like if you it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something I would associate with roadkill
skunk if that would be a roadkill skunk to
[SPEAKER_01]: me like Smells like right dead off the
side of the road calling it strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just call it strawberries So but then
I'd and I'd never heard the term roadkill
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk that came out much later for me But
yeah, I love I love skunky turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like everything At different times like
I'll get burnt out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't get to burn out on skittles
skittles is one Of those ones I can go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to but it's not smoking on right now
Zetopia is what I'm smoking on but I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: also smoking on some cakes from can
organics I'm smoking on a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff like that strain is
amazing So but the Zetopia has got the the
[SPEAKER_01]: candy turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like candy turps, but I also Was the
last thing that wasn't candy I was smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: on some Donnie burger from flora and flame
any good jacks So I have not seen good
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackson a long time I've seen stuff that
has some more Expression like super silver
[SPEAKER_01]: like I was smoking some super silver from
flora and flame same company in Oakland
[SPEAKER_01]: and There's some good, you know,
there's Durban's and there's Panama not
[SPEAKER_01]: Panama red.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some red Congolese It's really
good really good a good happy weed strong
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, but really like it's energetic and
it makes you feel really good like I like
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa's like That and we've really West
Coast has really gone away from sativa's
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part There's little patches
of in groups of people that definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: like Sativa's but so much candy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean 20% of what I'm fino hunting is
candy 80 sorry 80% is candy and 20% is
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Wild weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're popping some Acapulco gold hybrids
nice and some just random rare stuff rare
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I've had that I feel Like if I don't
germinate net now that I might not be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to It would not be a waste of holding
seeds for a long time and not being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn the certain genetics right now
That like are gonna be extinct right that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't gonna be around let's get lost So
much stuff got lost but now with tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and now with awareness and
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be able to save a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean most Not all of but almost all of
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up with those are gone You know,
it's like people didn't preserve them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm the cat piss that we had Gone for
25 years not 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry 2005 for 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's been gone since 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really the one that we have I
haven't seen it in almost 20 years and But
[SPEAKER_01]: there would be like Brax in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't it didn't have a nice structure,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like sometimes it looks like shreds in
the bag and if you just went by the look
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd say I don't want that I'm not gonna
pay $60 for something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so New Jersey and then when did
you move out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like seven years ago Nice we moved
pretty quickly to LA just like on the East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast 2015 There wasn't a lot of people
pressing rosin at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more built out in LA LA was huge
that for extract LA has been huge shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: It was they were crazy about their
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's our of it Yeah pizza boxes
for shatter was invented in Los Angeles I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe some people are gonna say Colorado
and that might be true, but it's one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them one of them but I remember going to a
spot and they just had Pizza frickin boxes
[SPEAKER_00]: stashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, just set up with tables and just
slinging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm Bram and slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah dabbing them holy water They had
the original sauce, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just straight sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was next level and Even high times
didn't even know how to judge it in 2013
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Cup in Denver We went there with
the holy water guys big shout out holy
[SPEAKER_01]: water All you guys that aren't with holy
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing your own thing everybody
good people But uh, we were at the Cup in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver together We entered it through our
company because we're in some stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we entered it for them with our brand
and the judges apologized to us Because
[SPEAKER_01]: they said that we can't judge this against
all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so different that it's amazing,
but it's so different and so we didn't we
[SPEAKER_01]: in place with it and What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was what?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you make it sauce?
[SPEAKER_01]: No So what they were doing I believe and
you know, I it was a secret back then but
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they were doing a extraction and
then they were slowly off gassing with Dry
[SPEAKER_01]: ice is what I believe it was yeah,
whatever kind of extraction they were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and they're slowly off gassing they
were capturing the turps and it would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce and this sauce was like high 20%
terpenes and you could just pour it right
[SPEAKER_01]: in the rig and So they gave me this big
box and I was going around just Pouring it
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody and people were tripping
because you're used to doing you know We
[SPEAKER_01]: had the guys doing the fucking one gram
snakes back then and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was just straight pouring
Yeah, and they're just pouring the yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like turps and it's like turps to
your face and Turps can change the high
[SPEAKER_01]: completely They can also mellow the high
out some turps just mellow it out
[SPEAKER_01]: completely So besides the cannabinoids,
I feel like terpenes can really dictate
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you feel the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me how you met Mila I met Mila at
chalice in 2016 and We were selling a
[SPEAKER_00]: Tumbler that was made in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually like her competition and
so she like walked by the booth and was
[SPEAKER_00]: like pissed off and and then like like
grabbed her and we started talking and and
[SPEAKER_00]: like she was still pissed off like after
that, but then We became friends and like
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually started selling Pollinators in
the US for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been selling them as much
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but just became friends after that
It was a good those those big pollinators
[SPEAKER_01]: were pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a big one back in the day Yeah,
they're they're still awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super durable Like they're easy to
repair, you know, like they can last like
[SPEAKER_00]: that like 10-15 years if you take care
seriously Well, they're they're simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, it's a great investment
Yeah So yeah, Mila out to Mila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was just talking about how I
feel Mila When I hung out with her like in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last year I feel like she's almost
younger than she was ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like she's been just got a lot of energy
She's got the Benjamin Button thing going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She smokes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got her mind, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean Pretty amazing and then she
spends so much time on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really amazing It's like meditation
for her some extent, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like she's like Yeah for sure Yeah,
so this burns super clean perfect white
[SPEAKER_02]: ash Nice oil good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we're halfway halfway down but
holding up.
Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: What was in this again, it's a point break
and Strawberry mimosa is the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that mimosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah This is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think There's people that hate on it
wash as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's got good flavor And there's
people that hate on mimosa, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people that hate on everything people hate
on tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people hate on tangy tangy
Especially for extract tangy is great the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to yield the best it doesn't
but uh As far as like I do like the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of the turps, you know and
Lemon tree that's another great one Yep So
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your desert island strain if there
was one thing that you got to smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of your life and that was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Jack flash do you which Jacks have
you smoked that you really liked or was it
[SPEAKER_01]: just the straight Jacks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah straight Jacks I would say
yeah, so there's a lot of people that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an interesting conversation because I like
Jack too and I got to experience Jack back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day When we had amazing Jack
Herrera that was very, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it on my podcast a few
times now But I really like the old-school
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacks and this new stuff that I see is
being sold as Jack a lot of times the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower It looks it looks okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like terpenaline limonene and
there's not a lot of depth to it You got
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke it and it smokes like lemon Yeah
lemon hazy lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's it's really citrusy and it
doesn't have a lot of depth, but the real
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack is You know, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of Depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of stuff has gotten watered
down over the years and Then the masses
[SPEAKER_00]: they only get to see one side of it some
great Jack in at Emerald Cup every year
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like but like the last two years I
haven't found it Wow It's there somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the place to get it, you know
Sativas especially you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativas Emerald Cup There's always someone
who's going for Sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone that's still got a cut and he's
rocking it I see some of the best ugly
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and I like ugly weed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another you know, it's like Some of
the ugliest is the best but that Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup there'd be people with some ugly stuff
and then people I've had people give me
[SPEAKER_01]: some stuff and they're like this is the
best ever you got to try this I watch your
[SPEAKER_01]: show or whatever it is and I look at the
buds I'm like, but then I get home and I
[SPEAKER_01]: smell it and I'm like fuck Yeah,
you gotta smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta you gotta smoke them to really
tell and you the smell is a good You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's it's a good gauge of how how the
weed is, you know this the smell but also
[SPEAKER_01]: the feel Of it and the cure and all those
things you can tell if weeds good even if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ugly There's still the cure that's
involved with it and the aroma and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so what else you get to try?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we smoked a hash hole?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got everything a rosin bar Is
that another vape pen?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a disposable vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a white thorn Have you ever smoked
any of Johnny, you know Huckleberry Farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, they're coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just talked we got Ridgeline and
Huckleberry nice coming together That's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely The white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah white thorn rose the purple hash
That's what the gummies are too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we did it in gummies and in the bar As
hash last year, so we wanted to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: different things with it Yeah,
I went up and saw Belle at Heritage and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were doing the white thorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they won with that as well Yeah,
these are great by the way You gave me one
[SPEAKER_01]: of these and Marlon Asher took it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Marlon liked it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like He didn't take it from me,
but I gave it to him We were part and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: like he probably asked me 20 times in the
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I hit it and I don't even remember
what the strain was, but it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: good You got to pull him a couple times to
warm it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, it's turps really good Really
good turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it has this white thorn super
unique feminine quality to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird I feel like very feminine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it's floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got like this floral character
that That's white thorn I guess the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: room can you can smell the whole room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really unique for sure Just great
turps So, yeah, so you got these on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market in California Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the the white thorn bars and the
gummies We dropped those those are those
[SPEAKER_00]: are like four five months ago So yeah,
it might be able to find them at a shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're lucky not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good Really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the finish is super floral on it Yeah,
it kind of reminds me of springtime I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has this spring like this warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's light rose element to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm flower It's rosy lavender rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is freaking for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has candy It has it's very very layered
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And just soft I Guess if you had one
piece of advice for your younger self That
[SPEAKER_01]: started out in this industry seven years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that that piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean you got to stay focused,
you know stay focused and don't get spread
[SPEAKER_00]: too thin would be I think a good piece of
advice For sure, if people are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a hold of you, where's the best place
to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an Instagram all this other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good one hit me up on Instagram the
Sam show is my Handle nice.
