[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the next episode of the
cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Lorenza Romanese.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the manager director of the European
Industrial Hemp Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you keeping today, Lorenza?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit busy, but we are very,
very happy in this moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything good on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're a very busy lady,
so be very careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We much appreciate you taking the time
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you got to the
[SPEAKER_03]: managing director of the EIHA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I joined in February 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working before always in the public
affairs, but in the wine sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had this opportunity to join and
growing and growing an agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was delighted to accept.
[SPEAKER_02]: This role and I keep working with very
pleasure and a lot of motivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: passion for this sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sector that certainly, as I said,
is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sector that is perfectly matching
the society needs as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real pleasure to work for the
association, just to remember to all the
[SPEAKER_02]: audience that the association is mainly
representing companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three types of companies, let's say three
major operators, the producers of hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: the processing companies and the traders
of hemp and its private products.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we maybe jump into the first topic
then straight away is the overview of the
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp industry in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know we had a little bit of a
snail's pace in terms of legislation and
[SPEAKER_03]: movement over the last 12 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give everybody a quick overview of
why everybody in the hemp industry in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe is happy?
[SPEAKER_03]: As of late and what the future spells?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A quick overview.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's complicated because Europe is made of
27 member states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the moment, when it comes to
Europe, the operator experience a
[SPEAKER_02]: fragmented market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are member states that are a little
bit more hemp friendly when it comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only referring, sorry, to the upper
part of the plants, mainly the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: extract and the hemp derived products and
food products.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, indeed, we see a patchwork
of 27 different international legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why the European Industrial Hemp
Association is is advocating for a
[SPEAKER_02]: European framework where all the operators
can work with clear rules that are the
[SPEAKER_02]: same from Lisbon to Warsaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: While today the operator are facing
different values, different approaches
[SPEAKER_02]: which complicate the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hemp is more than only the upper part
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very glad that afterwards we might
exchange some words on other sectors than
[SPEAKER_02]: only food and food supplement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevertheless, why we are happy in this
moment is simply because finally one
[SPEAKER_02]: country that is Great Britain has decided
to move forward and to regulate these
[SPEAKER_02]: products, namely the hemp derived product
from the upper part of the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp extract containing CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to sum it up, they were FSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the food standards authorities was
looking at this product and try to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: way how to regulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So FSA encouraged the sector to move into
the direction of sending application and
[SPEAKER_02]: submitting application, novel food
application to measure the TDI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tolerable daily intake for these
products and the company that were
[SPEAKER_02]: submitting a toxicological studies package
and they were doing a novel food
[SPEAKER_02]: application and they were on the market in
February 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they have completed all these
requirements from FSA, they can trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can stay on the market with their
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally what we were asking and
advocating for that was legal certainty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened and it arrives even if only in
one country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the idea is that we will apply the
same novel food application in Europe and
[SPEAKER_02]: submit this application as well to FSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have already submitted some application
based on the preliminary results of the
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicological studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we are conducting, but the studies
are not over yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very briefly, we invested the member
invested 3.5 million of euros into a
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicological studies for both products,
isolate CBD naturally derived and full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, we have among these 3.5
million of euros, 1.6 is dedicated to THC
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicological studies on human beings with
the scope of increasing the levels of THC
[SPEAKER_02]: only in the final products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so just a quick overview that novel
food applications are available in the UK
[SPEAKER_03]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw the list is like 3,500
companies got through to the very last
[SPEAKER_03]: round, but maybe a 10% of them are
actually going to get approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the Irish companies,
Chanel McCoy was one of the first to get
[SPEAKER_03]: approval over there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're looking to do is take the
model of the UK build replicated into the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Food Safety Authority model and
how long do you think it's going to take
[SPEAKER_03]: the European model to enact what the UK
have brought to fruition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's clarify because when the novel
food application process started in UK,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean UK was still part of Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that UK has a special
methodology, they just applied it faster
[SPEAKER_02]: because they added a deadline while in
Europe there is no deadline, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: application is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so there were minor differences with
FSA, sorry, but then the process is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have been doing in UK in this
moment, we did it because of the time
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints that we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we simply do the rest towards EFSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, EFSA is different because
what we liked and what we are very happy
[SPEAKER_02]: that our member can enjoy is the fact that
they can stay on the market because FSA,
[SPEAKER_02]: the only slightly difference is that they
created an intermediate step that is so
[SPEAKER_02]: clear today in UK while it's not in
Europe, meaning the companies that have
[SPEAKER_02]: done the three requirements that I've
stated before can stay awaiting for
[SPEAKER_02]: evidences.
[SPEAKER_02]: While in Europe, if you do not have
completed your toxicological studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: this product should not be marketed
because the provision called the temporary
[SPEAKER_02]: period has been deleted from the novel
food regulation, European novel food
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation in January 19.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why today we have 27 different
approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I think the clear science and
regulation, I think is what we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: screaming out for in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's kind of, you can see the
top brands are already kind of coming to
[SPEAKER_03]: the fore at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's kind of getting rid of
the cowboys and have a couple of,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the M&A action over the course of
2023 and 2024 with the mergers and
[SPEAKER_03]: acquisitions that are going to happen in
the European industry will be like the
[SPEAKER_03]: speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, let's wait for the
toxicological studies and the final
[SPEAKER_02]: submission that will dramatically clarify
the status of these products in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the association,
the toxicological studies are nearly over
[SPEAKER_02]: for food spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, for the isolate CBD while the food
spectrum is still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it comes the risk assessment from
FSA and EFSA both they last nine months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the first results, according to
my, to our opinion, might arrive in 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: The full risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think a lot of our fingers crossed
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next topic I wanted to talk to you
about was hemp and construction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we hear a lot of food noise about the
novel food application, but if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: your eye on the industry, you understand
that the real capital and the real markets
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to move toward IPable
constructable products used from hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of hemp and construction and who
[SPEAKER_03]: you see as some of the leaders and what's
happening in that territory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start from an assumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hemp sector will be a big sector and a
major sector only if the operators will
[SPEAKER_02]: have access to all parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're simply focusing on the upper
part of the plants because we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: clarify to legally clarify the extract and
the CBD products while hemp is much more
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp is composed by fibers as well by
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the real industrial hemp sector should
be an industrial sector as the name call
[SPEAKER_02]: us and that is planted firstly in open
air.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been harvested on the field with
machineries and the best model for hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: according to the association is the
so-called tripod use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we process and we collect the stocks
that contains the fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we separate the biomass, the green
materials, namely the what is left from
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit in top from flower in top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we collect the seeds to produce dry,
dry food or seeds oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the perfect model for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's focus on the bottom part of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said at the beginning,
I'm very happy to have the chance to speak
[SPEAKER_02]: to discuss with you about something else
than CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So indeed the construction sector has a
huge potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite well established in Europe,
but especially the interest is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that the demands are higher than
what the sector can supply is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: signal and a good reply from the sector is
that the construction sector can be scaled
[SPEAKER_02]: up quite easily compared to other sectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, let's clarify what we are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we are talking about hemp in
construction, it can be used in the
[SPEAKER_02]: following application.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be used as an insulation material
from the corticated technical fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be used as a hemp crete made of
sheaves and lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like blocks or bricks or prefab
walls as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have members that are doing these
technologies as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as well with in restoration of
architectural heritage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most developed country when it comes
to hemp construction is UK and France.
[SPEAKER_02]: These countries are most advanced market
for these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potential of the hemp in construction
is very high as the conversion to natural
[SPEAKER_02]: material is expected in the construction
sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that the European Union,
when thinking about the future of the
[SPEAKER_02]: construction, they are integrating natural
and bio-based products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the good moment for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some bottlenecks today.
[SPEAKER_02]: These bottlenecks are in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Europe is dramatically lacking
of the cortication lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We count in Europe less than 10 the
cortication lines, which is not enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: supply all the demands of these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, as I said before,
the investment needed are not so important
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for the sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for the operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially, we should not forget,
it is extremely good for the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: because the time is running out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we should as well discuss about all
the good quality of the hemp construction
[SPEAKER_02]: material when it comes to fire resistant,
when it comes to antibacterial resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all aspects that should be
taken into account when we discuss about
[SPEAKER_02]: the construction in hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great overview now for most
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you have a look at the
industry, really, it's insulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hemp creed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of different
territories where this fiber and this
[SPEAKER_03]: material just works as a perfect
ingredient for these end products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the R&D over the next 12
months, 18 to 24 months, should be pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: exciting for the building industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think you're only starting to
see some of the big, big players start to
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe have an R&D facility where they're
working on it or outsourcing it to other
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got capital to expand in the
European market, that's where my money
[SPEAKER_03]: would be going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your investment could be growing,
your investment, if you invest today in
[SPEAKER_02]: this kind of company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are seeing members that are working
with this product joining EIA because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the interest, is certainly increasing,
increasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're just at the time there at 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to keep you long because as
I said, I know you're a very busy lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: We very much appreciate your time and
explaining, giving everybody a quick
[SPEAKER_03]: overview of these topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hope you have a lovely day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we can chat again towards the
end of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're giving even more bigger smiles
over more greater news that we've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for inviting me here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish you all a very nice day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Lorenza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great day and chat to everybody
again soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye bye.
