[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of The Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined in this show
by Yona Simerman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yona, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've been in the news a lot over the
last week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of give everybody a little
overview of how you got to co-found Big
[SPEAKER_01]: Tech for Cannes and your journey in the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually originally Canadian,
but I've been living in Israel for over 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: My entire career has been in the Israeli
tech ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked for a couple of high-tech
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I ran my own agency doing strategic
marketing for Israeli tech companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran that for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got into the medical cannabis
space, honestly, because I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this was 2017, 2018,
and the cannabis industry was everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I opened a business development company
with a partner in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were bringing over Israeli cannabis
technologies to the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would do their commercialization
strategies, you know, make sure they were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to overcome any regulatory hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they were ready, we would
introduce them to either investors or
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed producers or extraction companies
for either raising capital or joint
[SPEAKER_00]: ventures, licensing agreements,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then corona hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what we're doing now is
we're setting up Europe's first medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tech accelerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's headquartered and funded by Malta
Enterprise, which is like the innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: authority of the Maltese government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking to support early stage
entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about IP based technologies
that actually solve a need in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not looking at brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, it's very early stage
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really looking to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help them build their company so that
they can access the tremendous,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking specifically about medical
cannabis, not recreational or adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we're looking
specifically at intellectual property and
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that have something unique to
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that kind of brings me onto the first
topic of conversation is what is tech for
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: You answered a good bit of it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a is this a short, medium or long
term strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: How hard was it to get the Maltese
enterprise government on board?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the way we saw it is that,
you know, 2017, 2018, 2019, there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: huge boom in the cannabis industry,
but all the investment money was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we understand that in order for this
to be, you know, continuing to be a long
[SPEAKER_00]: term growing dynamic industry,
we have to we have to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: providing products and and processes and
solutions that are safe and they're cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and they're clinically validated
and they're sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, so that we're bringing
products to more patients and educating
[SPEAKER_00]: both patients and physicians that they can
benefit from these amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, what we're seeing is that,
you know, the barriers of entry for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry to biotech, to large
pharma, to the high tech sectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are challenges that we need to
overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether that's, you know, producing
stable products at scale or reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: operational costs, validating
biopharmaceutical products for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: indications, digital health solutions
across the board, there is room for
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what Tech4Can is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, what we're doing is we are
it's a short term program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 12 week cohort that during that
cohort, the companies get funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a mentorship and a curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get commercial services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provided by leading financial bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will help them with any legal
questions, marketing, financial
[SPEAKER_00]: contractions, regulatory issues that they
may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real kicker here and what makes it
special and different than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerator is that entrepreneurs who join
us get to do a validation pilot or a
[SPEAKER_00]: feasibility study or proof of concept in
an EU GMP licensed facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're already able within the three
months of the cohort to move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: either with proof of concept or
commercialization milestones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, the startup just by
joining the cohort, just by completing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cohort, essentially increases their
valuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the cohort, we will
write up like a POC report for our
[SPEAKER_00]: investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then investors can then continue in
ongoing rounds directly to the startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really, I mean, we use the word
accelerator and not incubator because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: short and intensive with concrete steps to
bringing these products to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because they're already
partnering with a licensed producer that's
[SPEAKER_00]: EU GMP, that's a potential partner or
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the cohort, they may even
be at a position where they're ready for a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint venture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously we chose Malta not only
because of its access to mainland Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it already has EU GMP certified
production, which we don't really have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government has declared that they want
to be the medical cannabis capital of
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've invested 110 million euro in a
designated industrial area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of Canadian companies are
setting up operations in Malta in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: access mainland Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are our natural partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the whole situation with
COVID, I mean, in Israel, we're 60%
[SPEAKER_00]: vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta is a small island that hasn't been
hit hard by COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the expectation is that we'll be able
to have in-person cohorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, you know, some entrepreneurs
will choose to do the curriculum
[SPEAKER_00]: virtually, that's fine, but they're
guaranteed a spot to do the pilot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: EU GMP facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of exciting things happening in Malta
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking to the guys in materia
ventures as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of see that Malta and Ireland
both with the kind of beneficial tax rate
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be the kind of two dominant
spaces kind of pivoting towards servicing
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical cannabis industry and then
further down the road, the recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, because that will follow at some
stage later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's an interesting space to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next topic I want to talk to you about
is there's a lot of startups coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry now at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's looking to raise capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the institutional investors won't
be touching it as of yet until all the I's
[SPEAKER_01]: are dotted and the T's are crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to set up a cannabis startup
anywhere in the world, what city would you
[SPEAKER_01]: pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What city would I pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would it really depends what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll tell you what the challenges
that we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that there's a lot of money in
Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't looking for the early stage
startups, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, most startups need,
you know, two hundred thousand dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: two hundred fifty thousand dollars in
order to make their next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the investors are looking for
much larger tickets, which is why the
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerator is a good is a good place
because the entrepreneurs get the funding
[SPEAKER_00]: that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the investors are essentially
investing in this this platform,
[SPEAKER_00]: this portfolio, diversified portfolio that
we're offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that what we found is that in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: there is huge money, but a lot of it is
going to brands, which is not what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not looking yet at the early stage
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there just seems to be a lot of
money in Europe right now for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right that the institutional
investors are being very careful and very
[SPEAKER_00]: wary, but it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that if you're in the real
medical cannabis, Europe's your place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for recreational or
adult use, then, yeah, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: better off with North American investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you tell me, do you see a case of where
the growers and farmers in Europe are end
[SPEAKER_01]: up producing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we go 10 years down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wreck is is legal in Europe as well as it
is in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see Europe having the more
superior, let's say, brands and growers
[SPEAKER_01]: like they do a wine or champagne or a
number of different products like
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see South America then in the
low cost alternative that pumps into North
[SPEAKER_01]: America because it's all about margins?
[SPEAKER_01]: And profits at the end of the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think looking 10 years down the
line, that's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, high quality pharmaceutical
grade cannabis will come from whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: South America or Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely see that happening,
but it's it's going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some countries, you know,
let's say Germany or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: are only going to allow homegrown locally
home locally grown cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think ultimately it's a it's a
decision about money and taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as long as it's worth their
while to cultivate in France or Germany or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, then great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we have these more sophisticated
products and we've we're able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: plant stability at scale, then it will go
commodity, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some countries will probably keep
their own growth for like a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really high end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have it just like liquor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have it like liquor,
whereas, again, the bottle of vodka over
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe is 80 euro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got a similar kind of cheaper
bottle on sale in different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully the premium growers and the
guys with the real knowledge of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: end up being the ones who can profit from
the European industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I want to talk to you about
was Israel have become a world leader in
[SPEAKER_01]: the R&D side of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the steps that got them there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Professor Raphael or was it a
couple of other steps, do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Israel's an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've been doing research on
medical cannabis longer than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, Raphael Mishulam has been
doing this since like the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who isolated THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's now 90 something years old and he
still goes to his lab and he still does
[SPEAKER_00]: work and he's still doing research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the universities in Israel have
like cannabis curriculums now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of Israel, look,
Israel made the desert bloom for many,
many.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the startup nation, specifically in
ACTEC and other relevant technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Israel, I think, missed its
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel hasn't had a short opportunity to
be a leading supplier of high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got 350 days of sunshine a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown tomatoes in the desert and
companies are now applying that to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that due to regulatory
concerns, we can't expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ironically, Israel might be growing the
best cannabis and might be having the best
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also right now the largest
importer in the world because for
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory reasons, we can't export yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've had four elections
over two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for political stability
and then being able to provide for the
[SPEAKER_00]: local market and then companies will be
able to export.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, all the largest cannabis
producers do already have offtake
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements to Europe and North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just waiting for the sort of stamp
of approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I do see that Israel has a
tremendous opportunity is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're the startup nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are applying their
incredible knowledge and innovative spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot to look at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of spinoffs from existing ACTEC
technologies for the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, however, that, you know,
in the past, weeks since we've just,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just issued a press release on TEC4CAD
once and we've received submissions from
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs around the world,
from India, from Africa, from Portugal,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Germany, from, I mean, really
incredible stuff that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are, you know, young
entrepreneurs who have their startups who
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking to get into it, but they also
have expertise that will help us achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what we were talking about in
terms of the stability and the safety and
[SPEAKER_00]: the wide access to this amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of entrepreneurs out
there who are going to either leave
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering or leave architecture,
who've got business ideas in their mind
[SPEAKER_01]: and just waiting for the capital to be
able to grow their ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been an absolute pleasure to talk
to Yona.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to check out TEC4CAD,
the website's down below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually TEC4CADEU.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to correct you.
[SPEAKER_01]: TEC4CADEU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a TEC4CAD.com website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe, sorry, apologies on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TEC4CADEU is, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a, it's the portfolio company of
my business partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's separate than the Accelerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Accelerator is TEC4CADEU.com or
TEC4CADEU.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody have a great day and we'll catch
you on the next show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
