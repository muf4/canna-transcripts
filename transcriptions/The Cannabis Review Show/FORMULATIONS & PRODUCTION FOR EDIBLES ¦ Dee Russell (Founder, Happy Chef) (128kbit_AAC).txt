[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, I'm delighted to welcome
Dee Russell, who's a founder and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: time author and a consultant for some of
the biggest edible companies in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Dee?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tapas√°n, though, is what we would say
down in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much for taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've designed multiple manufacturing
facilities and you have hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations and recipes to your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give everybody a brief
little overview of your current position
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry and how you ended up
getting there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've actually been in the industry
in the industry since 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite a little spit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as long as some of the people that I
know and my mentors that were in as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I work currently as a consultant and
formulator in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I design and blueprint and help other
brands and other countries open all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have designed over 17 kitchens now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two more that's on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be getting to 19 here by
the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I design manufacturing and extraction
labs from commercial kitchens to also the
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent, solvent lists, whether you need
ethanol extraction, CO2 or hydrocarbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the commercial kitchens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also license my formulations to
different brands and help with the brand
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have over 400 plus skews or products
of mine that are in circulation in the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp, as well as the medical marijuana,
marijuana industry with a multitude of
[SPEAKER_01]: brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the ones that I can name would be
like Dr. Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're partners of mine as well as Elite
Gardens, CBD, American Green, CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cure Leaf, just to name some of the big
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: My latest one here on the island that is
the top selling edible products on the
[SPEAKER_01]: island is Rosaretta.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a little bit about me and
what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a three time published author of the
Happy Chef Expert Cannabis Cookbook
[SPEAKER_01]: series.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my claim to fame was my first cookbook
that I launched was actually in
[SPEAKER_01]: partnership with Dr. Green Thumb himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've heard of him, his name is B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Royal of Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a leading singer, rapper of the hip
hop group Cypress Hill that is an
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally known Latino hip hop
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that cookbook included his album as
a free download.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was their chef, their edible chef,
and I still work with them designing their
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing labs as well as their
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but a long run and I'm happy to still
be here and I'm loving the space and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't wait for more to get in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more people in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a highly accomplished careers today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take me back to the first ever balsamic
vinaigrette that you produced as a young
[SPEAKER_00]: person producing your first product like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the hurdles that you had
to overcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I go really in depth in it in my in
my first expert cannabis cookbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of details that when it comes
to plant infusion into fats because
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is not water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make it water soluble with a
extraction method using maltodextrin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's a different topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But infusing a fat, you have to work with
the different, you know, there's boiling
[SPEAKER_01]: points and there's also flash points or
smoke points with the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's compounds that you can lose in the
plant, terpenes mainly, but also you can
[SPEAKER_01]: lose potencies and lose one of the more
like broad spectrum capabilities that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has when you are in the extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So choosing your fat that you want to bind
it with on beforehand before you put it
[SPEAKER_01]: into your recipe is utmost important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've kind of strayed away from
can of butter because there are healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: options such as olive oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avocado oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main one I like to use is MCT coconut
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: MCT is a medium chain triglyceride,
which allows the medicine to actually go
[SPEAKER_01]: through your body faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that the medicine actually hits you
faster instead of, oh, I took an edible
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's now or later and hasn't hit me
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, everyone makes a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoops, I took too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think we've all been
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody has a bad edible story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that actually kind of brings me on
to the main kind of first topic of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show and it's edible formulations and
production methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the formulations type of
things, obviously, what are the top two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three things that people should be looking
at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it protecting IP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ensuring the absorption rate and the
solubility of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the kind of main things when it
comes to the formulation side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are paramount to be keeping your eye
on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously, you're the chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's job number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most important jobs is
homogeneity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly what you said, the delivery method
of getting into the fat that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: binding it to get it into your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to have your formula to the
quantity of the net weight or wet weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on if you're baking or making
confections, gummies, per se, getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: formula right so that each dose is exactly
what it's supposed to be is of utmost
[SPEAKER_01]: importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's when edibles can get
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it edible roulette.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make a batch and it's not
completely homogenized and it doesn't pass
[SPEAKER_01]: your homogeneity test at the lab,
you can eat one and feel nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody can get an 800 milligram
gummy and then it's night, night grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not going to make it to your soccer
practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely say homogeneity,
quality of your ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything with infusion is
temperature, time, and love, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put your energy into everything that
you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you love what you do and the recipe
is solid, the rest is just formulas and
[SPEAKER_01]: math.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can master this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to me, when you actually
dive deep into this topic, that it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the beautiful marrying of art and
science together, where you have to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: master of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not just about the tasting
product and the combinations and recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the minute molecule recipes and
how this is going to be playing across
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors and across different body weight
sizes and a number of different metrics
[SPEAKER_00]: that need to be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weight, body mass, all of that makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as your extraction process,
I found that my favorite form of
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction is, honestly, solventless,
working with bubble hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the more artisanal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the artisanal form of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the scientific form of
extraction, which would be with solvents
[SPEAKER_01]: like hydrocarbon and CO2 and ethanol and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And taking something to distillate form,
you basically just made it tasteless,
[SPEAKER_01]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're working in the medical
market, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some people like it being
tasteless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you can take the potency up a
lot higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you work in the distillation
process, you take the potency up higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, I find it to be more medically
beneficial for the patient to keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: simple and work with the entourage effect
of the plant, work with more full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, broad spectrum, work with more
of the cannabinoids that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the plant, in its natural form,
works like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has compounds that protect it from
other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the industry, unfortunately,
is focused on high levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, as there is great benefits of THC,
there's also some possible adverse side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that you can feel, such as the
couch locks, the paranoia, some anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cheeses of the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get up to the high 20s and low
30s of delta 9 potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are known to give you a little
bit of arrhythmia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can cause anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having it paired with a full spectrum
range of also balancing the CBD and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBN and the terpenes, it gives you
more of the effect that your overall body
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as more education and more
science and more research comes out,
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry is only going to grow and get
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes, then, to, let's say,
the future of formulations, it is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we get federal legalization,
European gets legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to need to be ingredient
suppliers to this industry when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the most advantageous route?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say molecules via fermentation
combined with other terpenes combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: other molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: These recipes and formulations being the
kind of, especially the medical side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, it seems to be that's where the
most advantageous route for companies to
[SPEAKER_00]: get patient-specific medicine right is
going to be in those avenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personalized medicine is in those avenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where that's in the side of the
industry that I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blessed that I've worked with some of
the best cultivators in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kenji Fujishima is the head master
cultivator for Dr. Green Thumbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you as the formulator are only as
great as your starting product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you work with a great grower and
your starting project is amazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: then your ending product, if you've
mastered your skill in production and
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, is going to be even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you can also manipulate and
change things on the manufacturing side
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing custom formulations with
isolated cannabinoids and make your own
[SPEAKER_01]: custom formulation and your own full
spectrum that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very much science, but it is,
as well as you said, art because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with nature and you're working
with how God made the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working with how it naturally came.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personalized medicine is going to be
at utmost important on our side because
[SPEAKER_01]: with us being able to play with those
levels is how we can turn it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that is that is like Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: We turn it into consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, as you can give a say a
Parkinson's patient a an edible and you do
[SPEAKER_01]: it from one strain, one whole harvest
strain batch and you put that that oil
[SPEAKER_01]: into that batch and that stops his
tremors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you might have the next
harvest with the same strain, same
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it doesn't have enough linalool
or it's missing a little bit of CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's missing a little bit of the compounds
that is actually what is stopping those
[SPEAKER_01]: tremors for that patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on our end, we are going to be able to
manipulate with science to make that more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a guarantee that this medicine works
and it works every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predictable and reliable products,
I think, is the aim, objective for a
[SPEAKER_00]: global sized industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fun questions now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who makes the best edibles in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: In America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few edible chefs that I that I
know and work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, Case, he's worked with a lot of
a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he has like over 10 companies that
he works with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's based out of Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: His handle on Instagram is Call Me Case.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably put him as my favorite
besides myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, my junior consultant, who is my
baker that I work with, I pull her in when
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to do a baking consult,
is Amy Robbins.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's excellent as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd have to say my favorite would be
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's impressive, all you could be
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody an
overview of what you're doing in Puerto
[SPEAKER_00]: Rico at the moment and who you're working
with down there and kind of what does the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry look like in Puerto Rico at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry in Puerto Rico is medical and
also they don't have smoking in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you can buy the flour, you buy it to
vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking is still considered illegal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much everything is in the edible
topical or vaping market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company that I work with right now is
Rosaretta.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my latest client.
[SPEAKER_01]: I designed their line of gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull them out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of regional marketing whenever
I enter a new space.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, I've built 17 kitchens now,
one being in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done one in Costa Rica, Canada,
and Arizona, Las Vegas, about five in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say regional marketing,
you have to go with that culture's taste
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because while I'm in California and grape
and watermelon and sour apple are the most
[SPEAKER_01]: popular flavors, those flavors don't
necessarily work down here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to work with flavors like guava.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did like a guava burst.
[SPEAKER_01]: This I designed to be like a gusher,
if you're familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Puerto Rico, we have a boobaloo,
is what it's more like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a guava burst.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have, let me see, parcha,
which is passion fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then mango pi√±a, which is,
I already ate that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, like the sour key
lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have multiple flavors there with
hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have more flavor launches that I'm
doing for the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as my books.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are doing absolutely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually wrote this book 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Happy Chef Expert Cannabis
Cookbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in partnership with B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rillo Cypressel, my partner, Dr. Greentham
himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it includes his album in there as a
free download, as well as it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: multitude of recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we were talking about science,
I do a breakdown in my chapter that's
[SPEAKER_01]: called trichomes, turps, and temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go into heavy detail on which
cannabinoids benefit which ailments,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as boiling points and flashing
points to kind of help you master your
[SPEAKER_01]: skill of binding with your fats and your
oils that you need to make it a better
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this book just celebrates its 10-year
anniversary this past April 20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I decided to launch as I live in
Puerto Rico and work down in South America
[SPEAKER_01]: now, I decided to launch the whole series
in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have it offered as La Chef Feliz
Cachonom√≠a de Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I noticed you had on the screen,
actually, this is my psychedelic cookbook
[SPEAKER_01]: that I actually pair cannabis with
psilocybin in these recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this also, this book is a plant-based
recipe book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also includes formulations and a
lot of C of A's, certificates of analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: and testing on both psilocybin and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my works that are what I'm
doing down in Puerto Rico with my book
[SPEAKER_01]: series now launching in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my latest project that I'm very happy
to be working on that I'll be launching
[SPEAKER_01]: next year is my husband and I are
launching the first cannabis textbook that
[SPEAKER_01]: will be supplied to universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called Manufacturing Cannabis,
The Art to Cannabis Alchemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping that this and getting it
into universities would help people that
[SPEAKER_01]: have the passion for it be able to learn
and master and to get a job immediately in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry because that's something I've
noticed as a license holder and a
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant that it's very difficult to
find people that have been in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as I have that you're hiring
people with the skills and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: passion to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are coming in because they
just really have a passion for the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're kind of having to teach them how
I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having somebody that already has that
knowledge in their brain and having
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody with a different brain that we
can all kind of talk nerdy to each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: that always helps in the formulation
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been amazing talking to Dee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to touch base again over
the next six to 12 months and we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: updates on all the exciting projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you'll be coming over to Europe
with the sign of some regulation happening
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to stay up to date
with Dee, the website is below EdibleDee
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend following our social
channels and go and visiting the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dee, thank you very much for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait to talk soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
