[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted you're joining this episode
by Dr Michelle Sexton.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Michelle?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm well and how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a naturopathic doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe explain everybody your
current position in the industry and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long you've been in the sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a naturopathic doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that my training was really
focused on the world of complementary,
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative, integrative, and traditional
medicines like botanical medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fully trained in medicine,
but our primary therapies are centered
[SPEAKER_01]: around natural products and building
health up from the ground up, addressing
[SPEAKER_01]: root causes rather than just trying to
treat symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got involved in cannabinoid research
when I was in medical school back in 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a postdoctoral fellowship in the
pharmacology of cannabinoids at the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now currently at the University of
California San Diego, where I'm involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in one of the first cannabis clinics at a
major academic institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see patients there and give advice and
counseling around the use of cannabis as
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a very extensive track record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded 18 different papers published
in peer review journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a conscious decision that when you
decided to focus on cannabinoids for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical treatments, was there an
inflection point that convinced you to go
[SPEAKER_00]: in that direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, it was very serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not set out to focus on cannabis or
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing some research on the role of a
protein receptor in neuroinflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially around brain tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got to Seattle, Washington for my
MD degree, I wanted to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got in contact with Dr. Nefi Stella at
the University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really more around the activation
of microglia cells, which are immune cells
[SPEAKER_01]: resident to the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know that he was studying
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell into his lab and doing some work
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really how it all came about,
was from the science piece and not from
[SPEAKER_01]: personal experience or through the
industry directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first topic I wanted to talk about was
cannabinoid-based medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody the most
up-to-date overview on what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: furthest, most advanced medicines that are
using cannabinoids as key molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the timeline do you think that
you're going to see before one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to market and actually is a dominant
player?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about cannabinoids,
there are plant-based cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we have many, many synthetic
compounds, different classes of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that these different classes of
compounds can act pharmacologically in
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the pharmaceutical industry,
a real interest is in CB2 receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 receptor agonists that don't cross
over into the brain, and also targeting
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoids system by inhibiting
the degradation or the hydrolysis of our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting that after about 30
years or longer, I think we're approaching
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 years of formal research of the
endocannabinoid system, there's really not
[SPEAKER_01]: still any drug on the market other than
THC or combination of THC and CBD that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been actually approved as medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a big opportunity then in the
creation of these formulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're picking a pharma generic
where the patent is run out and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding cannabinoids to enhance the
efficacy of that, or is it potentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech company who can make their own
entourage effect from a multitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, flavonoids, and cannabinoids and
turn that into a formulation that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: patent protection around it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of those two avenues is the most
advantageous, do you think, or are they
[SPEAKER_00]: both running in parallel with each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, patent medicine is kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be hard to get patents around
formulations, but because these are
[SPEAKER_01]: natural products, you can't patent an
individual natural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the industry is really way
ahead of our formal scientific research
[SPEAKER_01]: into all of these different combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot more information from people
in the real world just using all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: because when we go to try to actually
study formulations, there are not that
[SPEAKER_01]: many available as a researcher to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think until it becomes easy to study
different formulations, the industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be really fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're far ahead of the science in trying
to figure these things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I'm a natural medicine doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an herbalist even before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant medicine for me is the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's my preference rather than I
think there's a role for single molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have a lot of very difficult to
treat diseases on the planet today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in a complex environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need powerful medicines,
but I think that we also need plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines for their role in building our
health up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where cannabis can play a role
in toning our endocannabinoid system if
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing that wisely with understanding
the dosing, particularly of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: the most potent molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next question is how does somebody fine
tune their endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are a couple of tips that you'd give
for people who are watching or listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the endocannabinoid system is a
system designed to ensure our survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, in today's very
stressful world, sometimes we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting for survival even on our
physiologic level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the primary impacts,
negatively impacting our endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system is previous trauma, generational
trauma, chronic stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's hardly anybody that escapes
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how that impacts our biology also
impacts our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one for toning our
endocannabinoid system is learning
[SPEAKER_01]: something called stress resilience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often, if we have been beaten down by a
lot of stress in our life, we sort of have
[SPEAKER_01]: to relearn how to cope.
[SPEAKER_01]: We honestly have to reprogram our brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this process, we are toning the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many plant-based compounds that
can also tone the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on one of your previous episodes,
beta-caryophylline, which is a common
[SPEAKER_01]: sesquiterpinoid found in different foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these compounds in low abundance serve
to build up the expression of receptors in
[SPEAKER_01]: our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a primary human-plant
interaction and relationship that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: with plants, that these are not compounds
that are in a dose that's necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be therapeutic for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in plants and the way that we consume
them, their role is to simply tone
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can think about this like with
peppers and the compound capsaicin,
[SPEAKER_01]: which hits our TRPV1 receptor,
that's the feeling the heat or the spice
[SPEAKER_01]: from pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even having low level of spice,
you're toning that TRPV1 receptor to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see this same function with using low
dose of THC to help build the receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this can be really necessary in
people that have been exposed to childhood
[SPEAKER_01]: traumas, other trauma in adulthood and
chronic stress, including PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, very interesting indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next topic I wanted to talk about,
you've got a lot of expertise in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Irish medical department came out
after a multi-year study on medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things they said,
it's crystal clear, cannabinoids do work
[SPEAKER_00]: for neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has been your experience in the
research in this sector so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mainly have clinical research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this experience or clinical experience
working with chronic pain patients over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 10 years or close to 10 years at
UCSD, where I became formally involved
[SPEAKER_01]: with the pain division at UCSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were actively using cannabis to
help people exit opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of these patients are chronic
neuropathic pain sufferers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a neuropathic pain is specific to like
nerve damage, which can be different from
[SPEAKER_01]: other tissue damage or other causes of
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the evidence is really
strong for THC binding at the CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's several mechanisms
throughout the body by which THC can very
[SPEAKER_01]: much turn down the volume on neuropathic
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my experience, CBD is not effective
for neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's been some good animal
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having worked with probably over 1,000
chronic pain patients who often arrived
[SPEAKER_01]: saying they've already tried CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we move them over to like a
one-to-one product of THC CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get much more pain benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly think, too, that for
neuropathic pain and some subtypes of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that actually inhaled cannabinoid is
a much better delivery, more rapid,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a higher concentration of the
compound into the brain and the tissue to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide adequate benefit from neuropathic
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the perfect
administration route for the dream
[SPEAKER_00]: product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it injectable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a topical cream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a soluble tablet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a solid tablet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that inhalation works
very, very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we have challenges with our
various governmental organizations wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: to approve inhaled cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically are using dry vaporization of
flour, not concentrates, because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dose and that we know that it's very
bioavailable that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very rapid onset, which can be
beneficial for many patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone were to be able to
demonstrate something oral that could have
[SPEAKER_01]: that rapid of an onset, that could really
benefit patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm often having patients using a
combination of inhalation for that rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: effect followed by something oral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not having to inhale again in a
couple of hours, but getting more extended
[SPEAKER_01]: relief and not having to wait on the onset
that usually can take anywhere from one to
[SPEAKER_01]: three hours for patients to reach their T
max in the bloodstream from ingested
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to move on to your book that
has been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe tell everybody the reasons
behind writing the book and the target
[SPEAKER_00]: audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so my book is titled Eat,
Sleep, Relax, Protect, Forget,
[SPEAKER_01]: an endocannabinoid guide for systems
wholeness for women.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this just arose out of my experience
starting around 2005 of studying the
[SPEAKER_01]: system and also because I had really
started my health care career as a midwife
[SPEAKER_01]: and an herbalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just think that there's some
misconceptions about cannabis especially
[SPEAKER_01]: around women's health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the book, I call these urban
legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm just trying to clear some of
those up and present some factual
[SPEAKER_01]: information around the utility of
cannabinoid based medicines in women's
[SPEAKER_01]: health, as well as when to exercise
caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic talking to you,
Michelle, and hopefully we get to touch
[SPEAKER_00]: base again towards maybe the end of this
year and get an update and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: research and development that you guys are
taking part in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, thank you very much for
taking your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
