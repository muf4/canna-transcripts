[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Tim McDell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a long intro here, so bear with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim is basically the current COO of
Bristol Extracts in Bristol, New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's also the chair of Finger Lakes
Committee of the New York Cannabis Growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and Processors Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a founding partner of one of the
first regulated marijuana infused product
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing companies in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Tim was also a founding member of Tree
Frog Cannabis Consulting and has managed
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple infused product manufacturing
facilities and projects from conception
[SPEAKER_00]: through to completion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a man with a huge wealth of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim, thank you very much for taking time
to join the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for the opportunity to be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to talk to you, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, when I was researching,
I was like, oh, holy shit, this man has
[SPEAKER_00]: got all the ingredients to be doing
exactly what you guys are doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very exciting things over in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of how you got so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly to Bristol Extracts and the
original first step into the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks again for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really it started right place,
right time in Boulder, Colorado in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mutual friend put me in touch with a guy
who had started one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and a grow to support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to do edibles from the trim,
and that was kind of the mindset on
[SPEAKER_01]: processing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we ran with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sold the dispensary in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years later, we focused on the
brand Marcaha out of Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved to the Denver that we expanded
that in 2014 into the Nevada, Illinois
[SPEAKER_01]: markets and really just owner operator
grew that we spun Tree Frog Consulting off
[SPEAKER_01]: of that just as a small consulting company
that focused on processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always said from the plant was cut down
until products were shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd work with teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very successful with the teams
that we got put in medicine, man
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies and different security teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were successful in winning
applications, competitive application
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses in 10 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a busy few years there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then life changes and covid happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew up on the East Coast and I
moved my family back here in July of
[SPEAKER_01]: twenty twenty one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year ago, Bristol Extracts brought me on
to help them enter into the THC market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bristol Extracts, a hemp cultivator and
processor since 2018 in upstate New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: grew 30 acres of hemp for multiple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp market kind of CBD markets in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: have taken a big drop in the last few
years, along with covid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they pivoted, brought myself in,
brought a chemist in from Oakland,
[SPEAKER_01]: California, and you know, 12 or 13 months
later, we were awarded the conditional
[SPEAKER_01]: processor license and we are anticipating
the conditional cultivator license in
[SPEAKER_01]: October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of first topic I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've recently got your N.Y.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use conditional processor license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe outline to everybody what
does that basically entail and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: Bristol Extracts to do in that state?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conditional processor license there
was a lot of lobbying to allow the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and processors kind of first run
at the New York market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the pillars of these
conditional licenses, the dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: license being the other for folks who were
directly impacted by the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with the processor license,
we qualified for it for already holding a
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp processor license and having a CGMP
certified facility, which is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing third party audit and
certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two tiers within even the
processor license.
[SPEAKER_01]: One allows a company to extract the plant
biomass into concentrates or extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other simply allows you to
manufacture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one allows you to extract and
manufacture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other allows you to manufacture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are fortunate to be able to extract
and manufacture and goods and then
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then to license dispensers in the state of
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are going to be one of the
main players when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, an Edibles brand or a vape
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to get into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have the expertise for them to be
able to fill all their needs all in one
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we've been approached by
several, if not dozens of West Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: brands and some that I go back a long time
with and various successful brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bristol has not licensed or chosen to
license these or work with these brands at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of our philosophy right now is the
next 12 to 24, maybe more months in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York are going to be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the market, we see how these
dispensaries open, what kind of capital
[SPEAKER_01]: there is to even purchase wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really want to bring other people
to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how great of partners we
would be or anyone would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that sense, as the chaos of the market
opening happens, you know, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: through this three times now and a couple
of other times as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just one strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the other folks that have these
licenses are choosing to license brands
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, they may be successful
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but we have house brands and bring them
out to start and see what happens in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many New York battle processor
licenses are there going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said there's tier one and two tier,
are they split evenly 50-50?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was if you had a CGMP
certified extraction room prior to January
[SPEAKER_01]: 1st of this year, then you could roll that
into the conditioner conditional process
[SPEAKER_01]: if you were awarded that license.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 39 total, at least that's the last
number that I had read about a month ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: 39 potential processor conditional
processor licenses in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it's roughly half of those
if a little less can also extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: but those numbers do change a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, and then there's a
smaller number of, you know, let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's 20 that can extract a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's like 12 or 14 that can
also grow out of those companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, great, but it's also a
lot of it's a lot of falls in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very capital intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you get what you ask for,
you know, especially when the market's not
[SPEAKER_01]: open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know really when the market's
going to be open.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear it's going to be open December of
22.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we can all agree that that's
not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a political.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we awarded we awarded licenses in
this year, and that's great and good for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But an actual operational market is
several months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's definitely got to be
interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was reading something the last
48 hours about that they're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: 900 different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be interesting to see the
the shareholding, how many individual
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs are there, how much capital
is is brought to the market initially at
[SPEAKER_00]: phase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the vertically integrated
companies like you just kind of described
[SPEAKER_00]: there, I think you see in Canada that that
didn't work as specialization seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the key to any successful business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a few New York companies might
learn that the hard way like Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, the cannabis industry in
general has taken a lot of bumps and
[SPEAKER_01]: bruises here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of correcting to pre-COVID plus
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, money is a little more
expensive to come by these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very capital intensive
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal over these next two years is
that the state will issue 150 dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, you can do a whole episode on
how DASNY and the New York State OCM is
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing these dispensaries and how
they're it's a public private fund to help
[SPEAKER_01]: get them going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of, you know,
it's it's it's a great equity focused
[SPEAKER_01]: something different than any other state
has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also the reality of business that
we really are looking for more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: communication between licensed industry
and state government because you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving gray market in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one should be arrested for for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a challenge of when you have
tax paying companies and companies with
[SPEAKER_01]: massive overhead competing with companies
that are selling product that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: paying any permit fees or license fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's a big Rubik's Cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to see how New York how they
handle that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was over in New York there in May
and I was actually blown away by the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of CBD stores that had cookies and
all sorts of different brands from the
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast and then the trucks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we we did an episode on the license
and the trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to clarify one thing, you said the
government are looking to open up 150
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the equity licenses that they're
given to basically people who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: penalized by law?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they that window just closed in the
last, I think, 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: They received nine hundred and eight
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hundred and fifty licenses will be
issued out of that pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be what's being referred to a
standard licenses issued in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the last Chris Alexander,
executive director of the OCM,
[SPEAKER_01]: said that those would be their timeline
now is kind of mid mid next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still years out from the real
standard what that's going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of those licenses are they going
to give out per tier?
[SPEAKER_01]: What restrictions are they going to have
on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: This first wave that's at least two years
long will be the hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think last count, there were three
hundred around three hundred licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: issued, maybe two hundred plus of those
got plants in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the light, the processor
licenses, I think there's twenty two
[SPEAKER_01]: issued as of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to live in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I'm going to have my
eye on continuously over the next couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if ever it is a state with a multitude
of different nationality and entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_00]: and connections, that there won't be just
one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I lived in Denver the last 22
years of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I moved to Rochester,
New York to work six hours, five and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half hours from the city down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just the the diversity, but also just
the interaction with people is is
[SPEAKER_01]: different in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people want a network.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have hustle and it's it's
really refreshing to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the few places that I've
noticed as well, where some of the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: from the banking and finance industry are
posting about the meetup events that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're having and they're all they're all
smoking away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas they seem to be a lot of more
turkeys are more refined and don't seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be as braggadocious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think New York is going to have the
shoulders swinging and there won't be any
[SPEAKER_00]: apologetic behavior for a new billion
dollar industry coming to the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are bold and it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, even even the I don't know
what you call it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's called the legacy
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my personal belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, that's exciting and that's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a world to live in that people
are not being arrested for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, you know, it's the job of these
municipalities and the government to what
[SPEAKER_01]: do they want this to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want it to be taxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it to be licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are they going to to manage that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for companies like us that will
be hit with 280 tax federal tax,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's hard to be a profitable
cannabis industry in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think I just read last night
with the top 10 or 12 MSOs in the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: only one of them is profitable,
but they collectively owe the IRS over
[SPEAKER_01]: five hundred fifty million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're choosing to just take the
interest rate that the that the government
[SPEAKER_01]: will give them on paying back those taxes
rather than borrowing money or selling
[SPEAKER_01]: assets to pay it off because it's cheaper
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, that's those chickens will
come home to roots like that's that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: house of cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's even simply like truly would
have been swimming in cash if it were not
[SPEAKER_00]: for the recent acquisition that whoever
was in charge of that one should be losing
[SPEAKER_00]: their head as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I bring that up because for
us, where we're at right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a twenty thousand square foot
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 30 acres of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have product lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're developing our brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're unloading more equipment and more
extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very capital intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal is to keep it as lean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes to the lean manufacturing,
you know, the Six Sigma mentality,
[SPEAKER_01]: using consultants to help our current
team, but also not trying to do everything
[SPEAKER_01]: at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to be years before
this market is open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we strategize and approach that
by staying profitable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staying a little bit hungry and a little
bit cold, I think, is that the modern road
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the next few years, I think,
you don't want to be getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so many things that I didn't get
to talk to you about because we're near
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one thing I definitely did
want to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've won the Cannabis Cup twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was both genetic wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so we we because I don't want to
take all the credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had with the company Marca.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won two medals, which are on the wall
behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super proud of the team that did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were both edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our focus at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 2013 and 14, I believe,
in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was a drink, a blueberry chamomile,
and one was a gummy, I believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: with so many products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a great team there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That company, I had my core management
team for nine years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was with that, you know,
founded and grew that company for over 11
[SPEAKER_01]: years, but then got to judge the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: The San Bernardino Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a great experience and speak
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm really looking forward to what
New York and the East Coast is doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: these kind of award ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you when you win,
they're a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you don't win, you're like,
that doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what everything in life, if it's
working for you, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, it's bullshit for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not following Tim on Twitter,
the Timo McDell, but is his hand like how
[SPEAKER_00]: you recommend following him.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wealth of information, Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking the time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can touch base maybe in the
next six to eight months and we'll see how
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are getting on and how the New
York market's getting on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to get to know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
