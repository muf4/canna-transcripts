[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Dr. Jeffrey C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raber, who's the founder of the workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He founded the workshop in 2010 with a
focus on botanical analysis, new product
[SPEAKER_00]: development and sustainability,
and he currently serves as the executive
[SPEAKER_00]: director on the Association of Commercial
Cannabis Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Jeffrey, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking forward to talking to
you for some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I've researched you, the more the
bigger the intro was getting and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: there was to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of basically going to jump
into the first topic as opposed to doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: big intro of how you got into this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Far preferred for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can just start with the first
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to test cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those who don't know, Jeffrey set
up this company in 2010 with the aim of
[SPEAKER_00]: being a cannabis testing facility in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were right in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, everybody's like,
wait, you can test cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: By the first question we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can test it just like every
other plant really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were kind of one of the first
people with a PhD in organic chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into cannabis at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the capital for setting up the
lab, was it an expensive overlay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And was it something that took a lot of
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: With your experience, were you easily able
to put together the kind of equipment and
[SPEAKER_00]: the personnel required to do such a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can imagine it runs into seven
figures if you're to do it nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was very interesting timing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did it, we raised one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars in capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of it went to the down payment of the
HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first big decision we had to make was
what what analytical equipment and tool do
[SPEAKER_01]: you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use a gas chromatograph or a liquid
chromatograph to go analyzing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: The liquid chromatograph is a little bit
more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it gives you the cannabinoid acids and
the neutral cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a better picture, a more full
picture of exactly what you're holding in
[SPEAKER_01]: your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it was more expensive than the
gas chromatograph, more expensive to buy,
[SPEAKER_01]: run and maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that took most of the capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get started then, it was a little
over six figures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, it easily approaches seven figures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll need about one and a half to two
million dollars to start a lab today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticide testing alone, that equipment's
about seven hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the equipment,
not the people or everything else around
[SPEAKER_01]: it to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I got into the research,
you kind of sometimes take for granted the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to be able to, let's say,
test cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you start to get into the kind of
molecular science part of it and the
[SPEAKER_00]: different chromatography types that you'd
have and whether you're analyzing terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does become a very complex issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll move on to the next topic,
because that's kind of where you started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I wanted to talk about was
the chemical fingerprints of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys were the first to analyze the
first few hundred or few thousand strains
[SPEAKER_00]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that process start for you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a natural progression and evolution
of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we started in 2010, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're testing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just start to see all these
cannabinoid chromatograms look very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost stack them all on top of
each other and say they're identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you're not seeing possibly
everything there, they're very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet you're hearing very different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell that the products are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taste different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start to say there's something
else here that's driving their
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, if I see 10 products
and they all have 22 percent THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something else that's driving them
being different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we literally followed our nose and our
chemical nose and started testing for
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did so in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first commercial effort to go
ahead and say you need to test for these
[SPEAKER_01]: other molecules that we'll call terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone thought we were just trying
to charge more for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was next to no importance for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lo and behold, after six months of
giving it away and putting those values on
[SPEAKER_01]: labels and product labels, we heard
dispensaries saying, hey, there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many patients are coming back to us
and saying, I don't like the highest THC
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the one that has, you know,
beta karyophylline or limonene at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really something going on with
these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward to today, I think more folks
are finally embracing the idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are a major driver to the
entourage or ensemble effect and are
[SPEAKER_01]: really important in what types of overall
effects you're getting from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and that kind of leads me perfectly
onto the topic that I'm going to spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: most time talking about in this episode,
which is the blends and the formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I've started to research this
industry, you kind of start to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that within time, the isolates and the
individual cannabinoids are going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: with education and marketing and
advertising, are going to be blown out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water by the blends and the
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that you seem very
ahead of the curve on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of intellectual property you
came across, metered dosing, cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis processing, terpene composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something you see being a major
part of the industry over the next decade,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think we're kind of on the cusp
of really starting to understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, unfortunately,
we've always named the products the same
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cultivar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have, you know, let's say Blue
Dream, right, I have the Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, someone says, here's a Blue Dream
live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a Blue Dream vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a Blue Dream topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of those compositions are wildly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have, you know, started from a
plant that somebody called Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even sure we all know what the
exact same Blue Dream is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became very, very clear to us that
there is a lot of chemical changes and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical transformations that happen when
you extract the compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might start with the exact same
plant, but what do I get when I'm holding
[SPEAKER_01]: an extract of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be wildly different if I have a
CO2 extract, ethanol extract, get it down
[SPEAKER_01]: to a distillate, a live resin extract,
even a rosin-pressed extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things end up with a very
different chemical composition than what
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we've all started to kind of
understand, and there's been some
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent work by Ruth Galili in Israel
and some others that are starting to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, these things called terpenes and
other minor cannabinoids are important in
[SPEAKER_01]: our cannabis compositions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look to something like Marinal
or even single isolate CBD, like
[SPEAKER_01]: Epidiolex, and folks are saying this is
not as therapeutically useful as when I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a whole plant composition or
something that has more of the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: components.
[SPEAKER_01]: So isolate molecules and high purity
molecules are super helpful tools and very
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable in building composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do we make these compositions more
like what the plant presented,
[SPEAKER_01]: more of what I was offered to begin with?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of the experiential effects
that we're told about are through those
[SPEAKER_01]: that are consuming either vaping or
combustion of the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even directly eating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the molecules offered from
the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant grew those, it expressed those
and said, here they all are.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I extract it, I've lost them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've changed them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those cannabis-derived terpene sweets,
maybe 40% to 50% of what remains is what
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually originally there in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've turned a lot of other things
into different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go from here's what the plant
provides into a vape cart or some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: extract product that says this is what it
would look like if I just magically was
[SPEAKER_01]: able to just convert THCA to THC or CBDA
to CBD and everything else is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: minus, you know, cellulose and amino acids
and some other stuff that I may not want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, you know, what our
approach has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I take as many individual
components and build up a sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: and consistent, able to be consistently
produced composition so that any time I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the same product to market and I
can infinitely scale it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's really unfortunate to
folks that have medical needs and you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's this product today and we'll call
it Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a month later they come back and
I said, that stuff really helped me and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got, you know, can I get the next Blue
Dream?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's chemical compositions wildly
different and it doesn't help them the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, you know, there's almost
nothing more cruel than here's the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that works and then I can't give
it to you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, how do I go and approach
making these compositions exactly the same
[SPEAKER_01]: every single time at any batch and any
scale so that once they are successful,
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in the marketplace,
whether it is medical or adult use,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will be able to be reproduced and
able to be provided time and time again so
[SPEAKER_01]: that the same people can use it for the
same reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the reason the Epidiolex and
the single component things, as we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: lawmakers aren't the most intelligent when
it comes to making specific decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was the most palatable
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ticked all the boxes in terms of
legislation, but the companies that follow
[SPEAKER_00]: behind, and I can see this almost like
chef recipes to a degree, there's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: multitude of combinations and so much R&D
that needs to be done that there is so
[SPEAKER_00]: much space to run for companies that enter
into this space with the right personnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to lawmakers, you know,
they ask for help all the time where you
[SPEAKER_01]: see new legislation about hemp or new
analogs and you say, hey, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: there could be the potential problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing that the lawmakers or
the legislative staff and aid say is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, I did poorly in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know any math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't make things technically
difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your point of it was easy checking all
these boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunate because you're going to
throw away a lot of the good value that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beautiful part of its complexity is
that it can help so many folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the challenging part of the complexity
is how do I find the right things for the
[SPEAKER_01]: right folks and how do I consistently
produce something that is highly complex
[SPEAKER_01]: time and time again?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like your analogy with the chefs
because I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have a palette now that we can
start to play with and start to put these
[SPEAKER_01]: compositions together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even layer on top of it for other
flavorings or other types of product
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really want to do that the same
every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we do that in a scalable
fashion?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think folks are still trying to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that really is going to be how do we
introduce cannabis in consistent manners
[SPEAKER_01]: to the broadest amount of people so they
can get their benefit time and time again?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do feel like we're really on the
cusp of starting to see more folks begin
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that and that we have technologies
and tools that enable us to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure you're aware that over in
Europe here it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical-led for the first initial
few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot different over to North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you see a scenario where companies
over here are able to create individual
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic cannabinoids and blend them
together with terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already talked to Ellen Sobel in
Israel who have already made full
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichomes in a bioreactor and
have made mass scaling of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you see that as an ability to happen
or do you think it has to happen with the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower as the original ingredient?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think you'll see all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll definitely see those biotechnology
approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some interesting avenues of that
that could be very scalable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to freak out the
authorities or the lawmakers if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it in a bioreactor as opposed to
acres and acres upon area that someone
[SPEAKER_01]: might want to come and grab your plants at
the wrong time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that is more economically
efficient at those scales or not is an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that still remains to be seen
until we can ultimately scale it fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just like the food and fragrance
industry, you see all of those tools and
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some that are great for
pharmaceutical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some that's good for food use and
kind of the in-between dietary supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can see cannabis across all of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can certainly start in the medical
side and go down the hardcore
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical path.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be more expensive, more
cumbersome and restrictive on some
[SPEAKER_01]: compositions and that might not help as
many folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's kind of what gets the door
open and allows people to feel more
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with this type of tool to the
physiological systems, then so be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to take that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do see all of those technologies
probably having some sort of role in some
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones will ultimately win out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's consumers for all of them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some of these folks with their
high purity biosynthetic isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're great tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they can be useful, but some of our
state systems are not really amenable to
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing them in the dispensary path.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's legislation or regulation that
make those difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're playing in some states,
but not yet in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they might play in the federal system
because that one's pretty wide open here
[SPEAKER_01]: and doesn't have all the rules fully
fledged out for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you see it in food and I think
that's probably a common place to say what
[SPEAKER_01]: might cannabis look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to look like food plus dietary
supplement plus pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of all mashed together or some sort
of version of those all along their own
[SPEAKER_01]: individual path because you can get them
through each one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hugely informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I wanted to touch off,
I was recently reading there that
[SPEAKER_00]: California revamped the laws surrounding
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I correct in reading that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a whole new... There was a
little bit of new hemp legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been some new laws relating to
testing inside the licensed dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: system as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be continued
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of complaints about taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough access via dispensaries
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very difficult challenge for
licensed operators to combat the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a five to one ratio of illegal
operators to licensed operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the licensed ones pay tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have higher operating costs because
of regulatory compliance and testing
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while that product is clean and
assured at the health, it's definitely not
[SPEAKER_01]: able to compete in a price sense with all
the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to be a while till
we can straighten that problem out,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really needs to come through
proliferating access, more access points
[SPEAKER_01]: and lowering the costs via lowering the
taxes or giving some sort of tax reprieve
[SPEAKER_01]: for a short run so that you can kind of
say all of it now operates inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed legal entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even over in Dublin, Ireland,
we realize and I've heard numerous stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about the taxation in the Californian
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that gets to change for you
guys in the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty rough to see the receipts
coming out of the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, wow, all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've reached the time limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could actually talk to you all day,
Geoffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated to take your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to check out the
workshop, the link is there below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend doing some more
research and checking out Geoffrey's other
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we get to chat again in
maybe a year and see how things are all
[SPEAKER_00]: going over your state side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than happy to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the opportunity,
Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you all for listening today,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chat to you next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
