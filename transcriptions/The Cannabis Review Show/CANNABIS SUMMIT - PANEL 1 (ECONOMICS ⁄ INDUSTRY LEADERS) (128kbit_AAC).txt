[SPEAKER_05]: Approach this from a bunch of different
perspectives, colored by our guests,
[SPEAKER_05]: our panelists, and their respective
expertise.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try to tie this together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this is a summit.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I think of a summit, that means that
people are supposed to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are supposed to walk away with some
of the things that are in their head at
[SPEAKER_05]: the end of this day answered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please don't hesitate to raise your
hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a question on a particular
topic, let's try to integrate those
[SPEAKER_05]: questions as we move along.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Bob Hobart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an attorney at EDAC States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work out of Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lead the cannabis industry group for an
international law firm called Clark Hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clark Hill has an office here at Dublin.
[SPEAKER_05]: My partners, Sean and Sam, are sitting in
the audience today and really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really pleased to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really happy to be in Ireland talking
about something that's new or hopefully
[SPEAKER_05]: going to accelerate the conversation,
because it's public policy that,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course, is controversial.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if done correctly, it can be a change
that actually benefits society,
[SPEAKER_05]: that benefits and perhaps provides cover
for politicians and bureaucrats and the
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to introduce to my left,
Mariana Larriette.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mariana is a life sciences and corporate
attorney from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: She recently left a law firm in Mexico
City and became the director of a project
[SPEAKER_05]: called Santorio Mumei, which is in Tulum,
outside of Tulum on the Yucatan Peninsula
[SPEAKER_05]: in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a multi hundred unit development for
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mariana will shed some light on some
of the things that involve sourcing hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: material if you're going to build in this
day and age.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else that I missed that
you'd like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the audience know is in your paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I am a life sciences attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in Mexico is regulated in the
general health law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a pharmaceutical life sciences
filter attorney, I start reviewing all
[SPEAKER_01]: these matters since 2016 when in Mexico
the regulations start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last year I had the opportunity to
join this beautiful project that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to create the first hemp living
community in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason why I quit my nice
firm in Mexico City and I moved to live
[SPEAKER_01]: near the sea is because in this project we
are doing three important things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, we're educating each time we
talk about the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, if they buy wool or not,
they finally say go with your information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, we're showing the government a
legal business in hemp in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to import right now the
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third one is that we are opening
the industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And people may be different between hemp
and cannabis for adult uses or medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in times they don't understand that
when we're opening the industry for hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're also opening the industry for all
the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a word that means is the name
of the family of all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the things I want to
discuss today, guys, about the importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of the definitions in our regulations and
in the law, because in Mexico the problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is not that cannabis, it is not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is about the definitions that are not
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the authorities have no tool for
opening this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the reason why I quit the firm
and now I am leading this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be very happy to see you around it to
Luma and Cancun, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a beautiful place there to show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also this is a good destination
because it's a well-known international
[SPEAKER_01]: destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not only going to educate and
open this for Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this is open for worldwide for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am picturing this place for a cannabis
industry all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of going and paying a lot of
thousand dollars in nice and fancy hotels,
[SPEAKER_01]: you already have your hemp jungle house in
the jungle of Tulum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a really nice resort, but that is only
a little bit of the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Robert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also to manage that is Mike Goral
from Armanino LOP.
[SPEAKER_05]: Armanino is a finance, tax, technology and
consulting firm with a top 25 in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike specializes in working in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's worked all over the United States and
operates with other international folks in
[SPEAKER_05]: the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, tell us a little bit more about
yourself for your background involved in
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was with, you know, one of the big
four accounting firms and realized the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis was going to be something that
was going to go state by state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've moved from Texas to California
before it became legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are the Prop 64 in 2015 and then
started burning about the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, I wrote a treatise,
a book, a research book on multi-state
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis taxation for tops of borders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I went to each state and how they
tax this industry, whether they're a
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivator manufacturer, distributor or
retailer at each state has their own
[SPEAKER_05]: rules, their own tax system, you know,
to tax this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very confusing for for cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then most recently, about two years
ago during COVID, I moved from California
[SPEAKER_05]: to New Jersey as I saw this industry
moving eastward in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, Bo, you did not miss a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I didn't know where I was going
this morning either.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bo is as a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: He and I quite literally traveled the
world together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like every time we're in a car
together, people are driving on the wrong
[SPEAKER_05]: side of the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that happened to get here in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bo worked for New Frontier Data,
one of the larger data companies in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States and in the world,
focusing on the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_05]: He left New Frontier several years ago and
began Whitney Economics.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's regarded as one of the top economists
in the entire cannabis space, projecting
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll talk a little bit about what I
mean by the cannabis industry in a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bo, tell us, fill the audience a
little bit more about your background,
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's nice to be here eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I took a circuitous route into the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing the flight economics at Intel
Corporation and sizing up their supply
[SPEAKER_05]: chain and doing global supply chain work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was teaching economics at a
university when Oregon, the state of
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon on the west coast of the United
States, was just on the cusp of legalizing
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Dulge side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I started looking at the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my students was in the industry
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked him how big the industry was.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the economist.
[SPEAKER_05]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I took that challenge quite
literally and started looking into it,
[SPEAKER_05]: realizing at what point that it was just
this huge market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just did both fee and was quickly
pipped up by a vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_05]: company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they wanted me to run their
operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we eventually went from adult use or
medical to adult use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we were the first company to go
public on the Canadian Securities
[SPEAKER_05]: Exchange.
[SPEAKER_05]: Via reverse takeover at RTO.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we kind of paved the way for public
offerings in Canada with US offerings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, being the chief operations
officer, I got a really good perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: all facets of the cannabis industry in
front and growing to processing and
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution, retail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then I started using that and
developing some of my entomomic things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I started just trying to answer
general questions about business and the
[SPEAKER_05]: economics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I started building the foundation
for others to use in the economics
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of folks in the space right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of interest and a lot of
folks actually at the anticipation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we lay the foundation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're behavior, business behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a labor, taxation, governments that
influence on the market for the like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So try to build a body of work in
economics and just focus in on that while
[SPEAKER_05]: other people did good work in tax and in
legal and other areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you talk to people about numbers
in the cannabis industry, there tends to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a little bit of an exaggeration because
we all want to talk about how exciting and
[SPEAKER_05]: how successful the industry is.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some days, that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other days, that's not true, but it's very
critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very important when you're trying to
make your taste, whether that's to support
[SPEAKER_05]: public policy, whether your company's
raising money, whether you're out there in
[SPEAKER_05]: the marketplace looking for partners,
it's very important to have accurate
[SPEAKER_05]: information, real information and
information that is based in reality,
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly when you're talking about
numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the next hour plus, we're going to
talk about some of the market numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about the markets
themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk a little bit about some of the
records that perhaps Ireland can
[SPEAKER_05]: participate in, if not this entire region,
in terms of what commerce will look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I mentioned, please just read for
end if you have a question and we'll try
[SPEAKER_05]: to work those in along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: A few comments at the outset.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is indeed a global cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make no mistake about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes those of us that we're going to
talk about in a particular country or in
[SPEAKER_05]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: in a particular state or region,
we understand what's happening in our
[SPEAKER_05]: region, but everything is connected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you say, how can everything be
connected when particularly in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States, the industry is illegal,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then by the way, let me say this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to use the term marijuana to
refer to the marijuana side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, meaning high THC products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to use the word hencora and talk
about non-intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_05]: The compounds and industrial uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those things, in my opinion,
fall under what I call the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might hear people talk about the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just mean marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the cannabis industry, based on what
I've seen and how I've worked in the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry for 14 years now, really has two
distinct sectors, hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's less pronounced when you travel
internationally because they make less of
[SPEAKER_05]: a hard line distinction between the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to frame that for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the abilities are not meant to be
scientific numbers, but the global
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry is projected to be $75
billion within the next three to four
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those numbers could be higher or lower
depending on which projection sources you
[SPEAKER_05]: use.
[SPEAKER_05]: But roughly half of that number comes from
North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other half of that number is
the rest of the world and the aggregate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is quite significant because even
when you think about participating in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, some venture capitalist funds
and equity funds, they'll say,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, the cannabis industry is very small.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to pay attention to it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's true when you compare it to
some other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not a small industry,
not by any stretch of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is indeed global.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: The cannabis industry involves,
as I mentioned, hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves the technologies that overlay
those sectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's international.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's domestic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about industrial uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about pharmaceutical uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about consumer uses for
wellness and for other non-abtoxicating
[SPEAKER_05]: properties of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're talking about, in many
jurisdictions, recreational or adult use,
[SPEAKER_05]: the polite way, perhaps, to talk about
using cannabis without regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe there are four distinct
public policies that already exist when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is industrial uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I talk about industrial uses,
you can imagine what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fider, writer, plastic, fuel, building
materials, so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are historical uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I'll know.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 1930s, there was a magazine article
in a magazine called Popular Mechanics.
[SPEAKER_05]: That magazine projected hemp to be the
next billion feet, billion-dollar
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 1930s, they were talking about hemp
being a billion-dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we are many years later,
after public policy changes and the light
[SPEAKER_05]: actually starting to see this occur.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that first of the four layers is the
industrial layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second layer, when I call
over-the-counter marijuana, this is when
[SPEAKER_05]: you go buy a flower or it foiled distilled
from that flower or it infused product,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is intended to produce a structural
active effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has high THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of our dispensary system in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of what Germany's about to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of what Czech Republic's about to
do, so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I call it over-the-counter marijuana
because there's very little distinction
[SPEAKER_05]: between medical and adult use in most
markets, except how it qualifies the
[SPEAKER_05]: purchaser of that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm in an adult use marketplace,
I simply have to be 21.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm in a medical marketplace,
I simply have to have a doctor validate
[SPEAKER_05]: that I have one of a range of conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mere qualifier for how you purchase
the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second of the four layers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other two, the pharmaceutical layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a different layer than the
over-the-counter marijuana layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would question anyone that suggests
that over-the-counter marijuana is
[SPEAKER_05]: actually medical marijuana, not because
there's that efficacy, there certainly is,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's over-the-counter marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pharmaceutical complex, the medicinal
complex, they control this third layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires approval by FDA-like bonds,
different jurisdictions around the world
[SPEAKER_05]: for specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the fourth layer, he has what I
call wellness or nutritional products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of protein from hip.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are compounds from a cannabis plant
that don't produce a high, that are
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated as foods or supplements.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, of course, is evolving as well,
particularly when you throw in the fact
[SPEAKER_05]: that there are novel foods here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, I believe you have to have a
balanced public policy approach where you
[SPEAKER_05]: legalize cannabis in any jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I mean by balance?
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at some of the Latin American
countries that initially came out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_05]: They looked at export-only mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't really have an economy based on
an export-only model in a brand new
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to balance that with some
semblance of a domestic industry as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we're seeing begin to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Colombia is a good example of
that, where they started out with
[SPEAKER_05]: export-only.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, they only allowed the
exportation of oil initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: They changed that law, recognizing that
the market dictated that flowers needed to
[SPEAKER_05]: be exported as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they're embarking on a domestic
distribution of regulated system for their
[SPEAKER_05]: country.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my point is, with that balance,
I think you create the most economic
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those of you that lobby or work in
public policy, please think of that,
[SPEAKER_05]: because you can't have a successful
industry just participating on one side or
[SPEAKER_05]: the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last thing I'll say before we
dive into some of the numbers,
[SPEAKER_05]: Bo, is the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the United Nations for
just a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an important thing when you think
about the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which effectively has been in existence
for dozens and dozens of years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It classifies cannabis as a highly
restricted drug, and all of its membered
[SPEAKER_05]: agents have had to enact very strict
control policies around cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: around marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recent November of 2020, the Committee on
Narcotic Drugs adopted a new recognition
[SPEAKER_05]: for medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first time, they said this is a
field that's different and should be
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled differently than drug-type
marijuana, for example, as they referred
[SPEAKER_05]: to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing that happened by the United
Nations at that same period of time is
[SPEAKER_05]: they began to recognize that CBD and
non-intoxicating compounds like CBD for
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp fall under the industrial exception
found under the UN Convention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my point is, law and regulations color
all of this, but it's entrepreneurs and
[SPEAKER_05]: markets that drive it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bo, let's talk about some of the
numbers, market-wise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And think to yourself, what would be like
to go with this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be better to set the
level set.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the global economy look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: I threw my number out there that I read.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then how does that, then you remind,
break down my range?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you, when forecasters try to
predict what the total demand is,
[SPEAKER_05]: they look towards consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look towards surveys that are being
conducted by the UN, by these various
[SPEAKER_05]: governmental agencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: These health authorities and the like,
and generally it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call you up by the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say, hi, I'm from the government.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you smoke wheat?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes or no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in countries where it's prohibited,
everybody's going to respond.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, I don't know anybody that does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can those surveys in the countries that
prohibit this, the responses and the
[SPEAKER_05]: consumption rates are recorded,
it's very, very low.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other countries like Baruch-wide or
Canada or the United States, when somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: calls you up from the government and says,
do you smoke wheat?
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's normalized and when there's
distribution channels and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, then the percentage of people that
admit to using cannabis in the previous
[SPEAKER_05]: year and the previous month, it's
relatively high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of the demand is based upon
consumption and then they decide a value
[SPEAKER_05]: to that consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the number of consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's consumers, consumption,
spenders.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the numbers from the UNODC based upon
these protections, the total global market
[SPEAKER_05]: is between $250 and $350 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is extremely
underreported because in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States, the total market and illicit
illegal is over a hundred billion dollars
[SPEAKER_05]: a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would mean that the US market is
roughly a third of the total global
[SPEAKER_05]: demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just not buying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from a consumption or a consumer
perspective, the largest market in the
[SPEAKER_05]: world is actually an Asian.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's China, it's India, it's the Asian
countries and then Africa and then the US
[SPEAKER_05]: and Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you look at it from a consumer
perspective, those are the largest markets
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from a dollar or a euro perspective,
the largest market is in North America and
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the European market from a dollar
or euro perspective, this is the second
[SPEAKER_05]: largest market for revenue perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I have to do is that as the global
marketplace normalizes, the prices in
[SPEAKER_05]: these US market and European market will
actually fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there'll be some normalization of
the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that this whole addressable market,
still legal and legal, but will kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: normalize and shake out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'll start seeing the value of
the Asian market relative to the European
[SPEAKER_05]: and the US markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can look at it from a dollar or
a euro perspective or you can look at it
[SPEAKER_05]: from a consumer perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to that, it's often overlooked
about supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so where is the supply coming from?
[SPEAKER_05]: So my firm has developed models that looks
at supply, particularly in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States, about where the supply is coming
from and then the value of that supply as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mike, what are some of the things that
are industry or market challenge?
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about tax eval, we were
preparing for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big EF's comments on inflation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just some other thoughts on what prevents
a new program from actually succeeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: What Stein has learned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's one of the lessons that I
think Ireland and other countries could
[SPEAKER_05]: learn from what's happened here in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: What generally happens is state and local
governments determine how much revenue
[SPEAKER_05]: they want to generate from cannabis
taxation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's call it 100 billion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they figure out, well,
this is how much in sales we have to add.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we expect will generate 100 billion
in tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they back into it and they
figure, okay, what is the tax rate that I
[SPEAKER_05]: have to have times the amount of sales
that will equal 100 billion?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they work backwards this way because
they want to budget, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 billion dollars of tax revenue coming
from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, what that does is it
creates such a high tax rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That the legal market strikes because they
have no regulation, they have no testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: they have no tax obligations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they do quite well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing this right now in New York
City, where they worked recently,
[SPEAKER_05]: they came adult use legal and they fully
granted four licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of those four licenses, two are,
you know, social mic witty licenses that
[SPEAKER_05]: we called, where people that have been
arrested or incarcerated for drug
[SPEAKER_05]: trafficking in the past, they're trying to
make amends to them and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's now that it's legal, let's expunge
their criminal records.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, you know, make it so that they get
a first opportunity into this new business
[SPEAKER_05]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: But problem is with, with only four legal
dispensaries, there are countless illegal
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries that are selling goods now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem is, is that when they get
caught, they basically get a slam on the
[SPEAKER_05]: wrist, fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they turn around and next week
they have another shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just really quickly to that foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an article the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a, there was a store near Times
Square, not licensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was shut down four consecutive
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just keeps opening again, to your
point, because there's no repercussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no, nobody gets arrested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they get a ticket, but it's legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not licensed and regulated
completely yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's perhaps that you need to jump.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's very surprising that
here in the U S that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we saw this in Colorado, California,
Washington, Oregon, all these states that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that came adult use legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Years ago, that now these new states on
the East coast are making the very same
[SPEAKER_05]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, even in New York,
there have been attacks on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: not based on the purchase price,
but on THC content, which is also a kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of a dangerous way of doing this because
it gives an incentive for some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: testing labs, you know, to be paid a
little much for money and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, just make it, you know, not a hundred
milligrams, make it show as 90 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it is a lower cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not a good way to really the
forced a non attack system on the hems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to supplement this a little bit,
another common mistake that's made from
[SPEAKER_05]: state to state to state related to tax is
that they expect this huge surge of tax
[SPEAKER_05]: and we is the out of the geese and they
don't realize that it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a couple of years to deploy a
legal program and then develop the rules
[SPEAKER_05]: and then refine the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And throughout that process, more and more
there was a full participate in the legal
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a ram that takes place in
terms of not only elicit to legal consumer
[SPEAKER_05]: conversions, but the amount of tax that's
generated at the state level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it'll ultimately get us aware of
their objectives are if they, if they do
[SPEAKER_05]: things right, they don't have to ask too
much and distance that by consumer
[SPEAKER_05]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: And conversion, it'll eventually get
there, but it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a setting expectations with
legislators and with regulators on there,
[SPEAKER_05]: a realistic ramp is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they work as that straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an important part of the
regulation in all around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic is to be shined.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, how we're going to establish in
the law and the better regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that it is a question for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: To classify the cannabis industry
regarding the percent of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we thought that is a droplet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're putting more taxes because you
have a tree, then the system, it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to walk the correct way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like sciences as a pharmaceutical
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell we have the general health law,
the definition of THC in the
[SPEAKER_01]: classification of a controlled substance
where the law states that is a major
[SPEAKER_01]: public health products, which contain more
than 1% of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're going to talk about starting
the regulation, we need to be clear with
[SPEAKER_01]: those definitions in order to not repeat
our mistakes because we're here to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about our regulations, the mistakes we've
been through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to help you to not go through
the same things as us, but only less.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So think about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about when a government decides to
actually put a law or regulation in place
[SPEAKER_05]: and they start to tax you on THC content,
it's almost like the government saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, we're doing you a favor, public.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're allowing these compounds to be
introduced into society.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to tax it upon how much fun
you can have or how much THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the right approach is not that
approach, it's the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what Bowen might describe this.
[SPEAKER_05]: When a government looks at the industry
and says, what can the industry do for the
[SPEAKER_05]: government, not what the government could
do for the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way that things become forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the government could rely on the
taxation, the tax dollars, they can do
[SPEAKER_05]: things and you can show that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you making an argument
for talking with public policy makers,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can look no further than pick a state
in the United States, pick a country of
[SPEAKER_05]: Latin America.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can show that those tax dollars have
been put to use for schools, for education
[SPEAKER_05]: campaigns, for roads, for public
buildings, for the public health.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are so many things that come out of
taxation for the canvas industry and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: all positive, but it's not about the
government saying we will allow you to do
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can we do for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be the other way around.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can the private sector in a new
industry do for the government,
[SPEAKER_05]: which ultimately benefits the people?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Mariana, I'd like to come back to
some of the things you talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about other markets trying to
get off the ground and having been off the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, what's happening in Mexico?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexico, of course, is 135 million people,
as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very large country by way of
population.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Supreme Court had issued a finding
four years ago that says you have to allow
[SPEAKER_05]: for and create a law for adult abuse or
dispensaries, for lack of a better way to
[SPEAKER_05]: put it, but that hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But talk about the three different policy
links, medical, adult abuse and hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's happening in Mexico and how it
relates, you think, to general global
[SPEAKER_05]: policy development?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Mexico, everything starts with a
medicinal regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start because a trial, an individual
goes against the government asking
[SPEAKER_01]: permission for a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after this first trial, they want a ton
of trials, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only for the medicinal area,
also for the recreation or adult use area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for good, in 2017, we had our first
amendment in the General Health Law which
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed us to grow cannabis for medicinal
and clinical research corpuscles,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2021, January, we are two years
after that, the health authority execute
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulations for the medicinal
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: These regulations are really interesting
because for first time, the health
[SPEAKER_01]: ministry execute a regulation in which
other authorities are related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of a copy of the drugs
regulation we had before, but they added
[SPEAKER_01]: that word, cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinox, THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what people pretend and is curious is
that we have a 100% legal medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: system, but we do not have access for
cannabis in medicinal areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for medicinal purposes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't go to a drug store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we do not find CBD oils in the
pharmacies, you need to obtain these in
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe Instagram, Facebook, in social
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're Amazon, it is not selling in
Mexico CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the problem here and the lesson
from this medicinal area for today?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to understand that medicinal
cannabis is not only about the pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to understand there are other ways
for having access to medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that will not take us a lot of time
because for the pharma industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicinal cannabis will take a lot of
years with clinical research, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: investment for developing these drugs and
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, congratulations, Guy,
with all your, what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: But this takes time and takes money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an industry that a lot of people
is scared or does not know enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Example, the law firm I was working with
was really challenged to bring the law
[SPEAKER_01]: firm into the cannabis interest because
people, it is afraid all the time when
[SPEAKER_01]: they saw the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lesson here is to understand that
the medicinal cannabis, it is not only for
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmaceutical industry and that there
are other ways and systems to give access
[SPEAKER_01]: for the patients for cannabis without
needing to wait all this time and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: money and all this investment,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, have industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, in this amendment was the
exemption and we are allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: commercialize hemp or products which
contain cannabinoids that does not have
[SPEAKER_01]: more than 1% of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here come a thing of definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of regulations, it is stated that
if the product contains or the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: contains more than 1% of THC, that is
regressional or menacing of, but it
[SPEAKER_01]: contains less than 1% of THC is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp that add a specific plant with a
specific genetic and that yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant generates low percent of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing here is again, the
classification.
[SPEAKER_01]: What my law states is that I can
commercialize import and export products
[SPEAKER_01]: which contain not more than 1% of THC,
not only hemp right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these part of that definitions and that
classification that we're going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: working here in Europe is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, hemp is legal, but it is not
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, guys, it is about regulation,
not overregulation, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when governments and the
legislator are scared about regulating,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to overregulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you overregulate a market with a
new regulation for cannabis that says the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing, the other one, you know,
can't trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's keep it simple, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third thing is recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really funny in the recreational area
in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2020, the Supreme Court executed a
decree which state that the parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: articles which means the prohibition for
consumption of cannabis are not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Supreme Court only state a
document.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not amend the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what consumers are doing,
they are going to report a federal
[SPEAKER_01]: affirmation against sanitary erase,
which is a signal of MBA, ask for a
[SPEAKER_01]: permission of them submission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they have permission, but we do
not have a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are they going to find the
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the other market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But now with affirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you let me know, which is worse,
not regulate or have a lack in our
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations because we are scared of an
industry that we do not know or instead
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating with clear rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my perspective, this decree of the
Supreme Court means a lot more danger for
[SPEAKER_01]: public scale that consumers are following
a permission with products that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only a little bit about what is
happening in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just add to that a little bit,
because we've been talking about taxes,
[SPEAKER_05]: been talking about total address of a
market and, you know, like 250 to 350
[SPEAKER_05]: million.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just on the adult use of
medical side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it comes to tax policy,
I don't think a regulator and policy
[SPEAKER_05]: experts really understand the hemp market
enough to be the facts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, but for perspective, a lot of
folks say that have this, the little
[SPEAKER_05]: sisters have been cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: When in fact, with just some simple market
share adjustments over to hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: substitute products in automotive,
in plastics, in wellness and the like,
[SPEAKER_05]: the hemp industry globally is at a minimum
of 350 billion dollars in total
[SPEAKER_05]: addressable market, just on 10 product
types alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you add the industrial side of
cannabis to the adult use of medical,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a half a trillion to a trillion
dollar market with a T.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and so it takes
policymakers, it takes them time to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand the nuances of the market that
have this really three markets in one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's biver, it's grain and it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people and policymakers don't
necessarily understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you're going into these
settings, when you're trying to look at
[SPEAKER_05]: starting a business, changing policies,
looking at tax projections and the like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you really have to become an educator
before you can become an influencer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what, what other thing about hemp,
by the way, who's heard of Delta A?
[SPEAKER_05]: Frazier van.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Delta A is a controversial topic,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an intoxicating compound derived from
the head plant, but not the Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the legal in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a ninth circuit federal court
about two months ago that came out and
[SPEAKER_05]: said Delta A quote of hope, culturally
fits within the definition of hemp and the
[SPEAKER_05]: farm bill definition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just last week, the DEA came out and it
had a chance to say that Delta A was a
[SPEAKER_05]: synthetic continent and that it was
illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't do them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It only talked about THCO, which is a non
naturally occurring product.
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is this is a legal product in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also what I call red state weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The red stays the conservative States in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably won't adopt the Spencer is,
but they'll allow for intoxicating
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds from hemp to be sold in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a brand new very what the
heaven had be as and it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to summarize some things and then
bowl and sort of ship to your part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our objective is to sort of talk about
North America and the global economy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about some numbers, but also focus on
what's happening in Europe on the taxation
[SPEAKER_05]: piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about New York, perhaps
overtaxed and overregulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an eighth of an ounce of cannabis
will cost you about 70 to 80 dollars,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you can go buy if you're a consumer an
eighty dollar eighth of cannabis from a
[SPEAKER_05]: store when the guy that you always
purchased it from will sell it to you for
[SPEAKER_05]: 25 or 40.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one month overtax overregulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now look at what they did in over by this
was years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the first country I've drafted
public policy over 30 countries around the
[SPEAKER_05]: world in this area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or why was the very first and what they
did was they said we're going to set the
[SPEAKER_05]: price point program below the black market
or the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paraguay the largest illicit marijuana
producer in Latin America sends much,
[SPEAKER_05]: much of its cannabis into to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so they set the price at a dollar
fifty per gram because the black market,
[SPEAKER_05]: the paraguayan cannabis was sold at one
seventy five or two dollars per gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one way to combat it, whether that
works or not remains to be seen,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it certainly beats this idea of an
eighty dollar date of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's talk about the exciting
opportunities in Europe famous now are
[SPEAKER_05]: focused on an additional and also the
Czech Republic will be covered.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I said earlier, I think Czech will
probably be Germany, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a great race,
a really great race.
[SPEAKER_05]: The race is on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's talk about the drowsiness and
the enlightening.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I mentioned earlier, from a
revenue perspective in Europe is that a
[SPEAKER_05]: second largest market in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's split up between medicinal and
then these emerging adult use countries
[SPEAKER_05]: and the like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from just a consumption perspective,
it's interesting to know that Italy is
[SPEAKER_05]: actually the largest market by from a
consumption perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a lot of folks in Italy that
really enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's, you know, what's the key to
these deployments like in Europe and the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States and the like?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if we're going to talk
about that now or a little bit,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the key to a successful regulatory
rollout is having enough supply in
[SPEAKER_05]: addition to decent pricing relative to the
market and access for the consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if one of those three is out of whack,
then it really slows down the pace of
[SPEAKER_05]: reform, the pace of conversion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the amount of legal capture that the
government and the country can get.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I looked at Germany last year,
they really don't have enough domestic
[SPEAKER_05]: supply to support their rammed into the
adult use states.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're going to have to do
self-favor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, they're willing to resist to
opening up the market to foreign
[SPEAKER_05]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're going to struggle and
they're not going to achieve what their
[SPEAKER_05]: goals that they're trying to meet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, this just the thought of
legalization in Germany has driven policy
[SPEAKER_05]: reform in a lot of the European nations.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's conversations during Covid,
for example, that the French police asked
[SPEAKER_05]: the French government to do more to reform
and legalize and get more supply of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was becoming such a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even the police are asking the
governments to do reform.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Spain, there's discussions and portions
that decriminalized it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's all these.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and then in Italy, they're also
looking at at legalizing as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's similar about Europe to the United
States is that there's all these different
[SPEAKER_05]: models for legalization and different
strategies, none that's been unified by
[SPEAKER_05]: yet in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the same thing that's not yet in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think ultimately what will happen is
once there's enough momentum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, keep in mind, there's 70 countries in
the world now or in excess of 70 countries
[SPEAKER_05]: that have some type of legal access to
either cannabinoids, adult use or medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an emergency.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an emerging industry that's
accelerating in pace of reform.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Europe is going to be on the
forefront of that and may actually
[SPEAKER_05]: displace the United States from a market
perspective, because they'll they just
[SPEAKER_05]: take a different approach to taxation and
regulation than does the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but it's an important point for
better, for worse than any countries do
[SPEAKER_05]: look at the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're fearful of that relationship
with the United States, particularly Latin
[SPEAKER_05]: America.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what my experience is.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to step outside of U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: policy for fear of losing relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: Business opportunities and just,
you know, general diplomacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's a major challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Vienna, Austria four years ago
for the Committee on Narcotic Drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were supposed to make the change they
made in November of last year four years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago, but they didn't because the United
States was resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there seems to be this notion that
we're going to wait to the United States
[SPEAKER_05]: to give us approval.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the United States policy is just so
messed up, for lack of a better way to put
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: On all things cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, it has the most
consumers, as Bo points out, and perhaps
[SPEAKER_05]: the most robust marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's also there's also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to say, you know,
in Canada, it's federally legal there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still haven't seen any of the
benefits of Canadian legalization to
[SPEAKER_05]: spread around the world and to say,
hey, let's use the Canadian model in other
[SPEAKER_05]: countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's been unfortunate that it's
still the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: that drives it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is because it is not about
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is about the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, regulation are only the things
we need to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regulators need to hear and to
understand the industry in order to create
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations in accordance for those
markets.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So might shift a little bit to some of the
consumer patterns in the markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were talking, you talked a little
bit about things that don't exist in the
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a branding for products,
product development.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of those opportunities to
account for?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are folks participating in the
European market.
[SPEAKER_05]: What could they observe to do differently
for us from a market set?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that's been very
successful in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: is branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of the companies that are on the West
Coast, you know, it's becoming a saturated
[SPEAKER_05]: market there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many competitors that the only
way to stand out is to have a recognizable
[SPEAKER_05]: brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those companies are now eastward
with their brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also going worldwide with my clients'
cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they now have 50 dispensaries across
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've opened up one in the U.K.,
one in Vienna, one in Tel Aviv.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're becoming a worldwide brand
like Coca-Cola so that it would be
[SPEAKER_05]: rent-e-dice no matter what country you're
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by getting that branding, people that
gravitate to a certain brand understand
[SPEAKER_05]: that if I buy a product from them,
I get a certain effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those and go off that consistency.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a McDonald's where you could go
anywhere in the world and have a
[SPEAKER_05]: McDonald's and it's going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be very important in order
to get confessors and elders excited about
[SPEAKER_05]: this company versus competitor that no one
has heard about.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is, is that, you know,
look across this road.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mainly men that are in this road
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this market is really still geared
towards 21 to 35-year-old maintenance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the products served for that,
well, the packaging is, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: geared for that demographic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there needs to be more women in
this industry, more products for women,
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging and things that appeal to women.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is still so male-dominated.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an area that I think is very right
in Europe and all over the world,
[SPEAKER_05]: really, to produce products that really
would appeal to 50% of the population.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wolfingberry on any comment that based on
what you've seen, markets around the
[SPEAKER_05]: world, what do you notice in SHs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Male-driven products being male-driven
products in their age.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a hole in the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think it is a hole in Mexico also.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, well, for good or for bad,
these industry is being opened by men
[SPEAKER_01]: right back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is my belief, and yesterday I was
talking with, that is, about women being
[SPEAKER_01]: scared to come in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is part of our work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, as I mentioned before,
every time you say cannabis, there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this is a market that is being
opened by men, women were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this will, with time,
take the place in the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about all countries starting to
regulate, and women were trying to come in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the effects I saw in other countries,
in the United States, in Latin America,
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her yesterday it is, in Mexico,
we are starting to get together in order
[SPEAKER_01]: for us to start pushing companies up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first of all, we need to identify
ourselves, our roles in the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how we can play this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guys, this is also really important
for you to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am really thankful, and I am honored
to be in this panel with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really important, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving a space for women because we,
for all of us, we will have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: point of view than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just yesterday talking with someone
here, and he went like, okay, males,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are aggressive, we want to go out,
we want to fight and take money and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: it home, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And women, we are so careful, we build fun
in it, we create the base of the society,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two points of view in the
industry are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to make, also, if we are starting with
all these industries, to give it a change,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you said something interesting,
other people, as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talked about overregulation,
the word overregulation involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes I look at the existing
system, and we are looking at what I call
[SPEAKER_05]: the dispensary system, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The sort of US-based way of selling
cannabis over the counter, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimately the model that we are seeing
adopted globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would suggest we are at the 10-year mark
of the cannabis industry, and we have to
[SPEAKER_05]: reevaluate this dispensary system model
because it is overtaxed, it is
[SPEAKER_05]: overregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see in the United States that these
companies are dying left and right because
[SPEAKER_05]: of being strangled by overregulation and
overtaxation.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you create an operable market
without overtaxation?
[SPEAKER_01]: With clear definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with PHC is that PHC is
classified as a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, till the moment, we do not have clear
regulation, and not only national,
[SPEAKER_01]: international.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to vote to the Convention of the
United Nations of Narcotics and Drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to start from there to have clear
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the problem with the
overregulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that the legislator, as I mentioned
before, is regulated with fear and with
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you understand that the THC is a
compound, that yes, it is a secret prop
[SPEAKER_01]: one, but also can improve in other uses
and in other ways the CBD, as I said
[SPEAKER_01]: before, then you will be able to regulate
with clear definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lack with no fear and we clear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the stigma in the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stigma in the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law is a law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law regulations are only meant to be
followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the attorneys, we read the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not care if the regulator thinks
that THC, or more than what percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, is a major public health problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're only going to follow what
the regulations state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the overregulations came because of the
lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how you change this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to see first to the industry,
not to regulate because regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened in Mexico with the Supreme
Court?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have this decree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were regulated for regulated
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not the model we need to
follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to change this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in Santa Marina, I also
elaborate a citizen bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first citizen bill we
submitted before the signature for the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal regulation of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We go for interviewing each person in that
cannabis business bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since that registry of the certified seed
is not legal, we need to heal the
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: That this is a problem in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wholesale stores is a problem because
even though it is legal for industrial and
[SPEAKER_01]: for medicinal purposes, wholesale stores
and drug stores are not allowing these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even those are legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to see first the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they need in accordance for our
current regulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not think about a new cannabis
Europe institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they are thinking about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am reassured that we all have
federal regulation for all the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you need to regulate is not a
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't be bothering the farmers and
the growers with the conformance of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and the crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to regulate the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who is going to use this product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the consumer is going to use
this product for medicinal purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be a specific regulation for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if this is for consumption,
like adult use, will be another
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing we need to see is the
consumers, their patients, the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, because of those, start to write
the law in order to not overregulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've already got regulations
for alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alcohol and tobacco can't be used just
like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so packaging, everything has to have,
you know, child proof packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with under 21 could purchase the
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, certain basic regulations that are
in tobacco and in alcohol should be
[SPEAKER_05]: adopted for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything is already there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so all the regulations for
alcohol is already there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonded wearouts, security of the product,
you know, as it moves from one place to
[SPEAKER_05]: another place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even the taxes, you know, do you have
a low excise tax?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, punt the illicit market out of
business because no one goes around,
[SPEAKER_05]: leading up to you go around and say,
hey, I know somebody that'll sell you a
[SPEAKER_05]: bottle of vodka cheaper than you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they have a store that's around the
fort.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just go to the store.
[SPEAKER_05]: We buy the vodka.
[SPEAKER_05]: We pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what this is too concerned
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've developed some models,
redesigning the dispensary model.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because, like I said earlier,
it's an up supply, it's the amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: access in this price.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you live at the access through
the dispensary model, then you don't get
[SPEAKER_05]: as much legal participation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I looked at this model where you just
open it up, you tax it, either like
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol, you regulated it kind of like
tobacco or alcohol in the sense that you
[SPEAKER_05]: have labeling and you check IDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then putting it into grocery stores
and gas stations and everything else,
[SPEAKER_05]: the amount of conversion was enormous.
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of opportunities for products
and brands and suppliers into the space
[SPEAKER_05]: was enormous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really did away with the illicit
market very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So opening it up, giving high volume
access to more consumers was really a
[SPEAKER_05]: viable model that maps the life tax
revenue, minimized the impact of the
[SPEAKER_05]: illicit market, got people participating
and didn't necessarily have as much of a
[SPEAKER_05]: public health impact as has been stated by
other policy managers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are alternative models out there
that one can use to really maximize the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry and give tremendous opportunities
for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just slow down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forced him off the subjury.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that you went there yourself,
saying that we should compare it to
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, the jury in the
baby-worth world, everybody was a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: center was replacing it, it was the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like they wanted to collaborate,
they wanted to replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should look back to what prohibition
in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also to learn a little bit about how it
was because the high THC is basically what
[SPEAKER_02]: absinthe was in alcohol when I think Mali
was called, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So alcohol today is taxed in different
tiers by actually alcohol percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing that we don't want in
cannabis, so we say outrageous is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: a practice all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every European country has a 15%,
32%, 30% of alcohol, different taxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: A different point I'd love to know,
your opinion on branding, you only telling
[SPEAKER_02]: half the truth about Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is building a brand, not in the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is building a brand in the
streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is a pirate all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Cookies packs, Tenco packs and
Jungle Boys packs in the streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where the brands are being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Credibility is created for recreational in
the streets, not in the stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cookies is probably the only brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also I've been to Toronto lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no brand loyalty in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is just another store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to question a little bit of
this and then see what your reaction would
[SPEAKER_02]: be and just, yeah, be a little bit real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I think, you know, it's really both
ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you have to have some sort of
creativity that creates that recognition.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's been successful, at least in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of competitors, because,
you know, since it's a private market,
[SPEAKER_05]: each state has its own regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get your own license and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that by having a brand that is
recognized from East Coast to West Coast,
[SPEAKER_05]: East and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: has been very successful, shouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm seeing in terms of branding as
well is that they're starting to brand
[SPEAKER_05]: user experiences within the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you may have a Cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know a whole lot about Cookies,
but you may have something that is
[SPEAKER_05]: targeted experience to the stock or mod.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a targeted experience to,
you know, somebody going out and doing
[SPEAKER_05]: that activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: These sports activities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's other user experiences,
branding related to just chilling out,
[SPEAKER_05]: watching the load.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm starting to see this emerging
to where their branding and the user
[SPEAKER_05]: experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as that they have consistent
products that meet those consumer
[SPEAKER_05]: expectations, then they develop really
good and durable brand loyalty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we just get like a whole,
you know, line of clothing at Furbid and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, things they're trying to be like
Supreme is, you know, as this high end,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, urban brand and lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cannabis products are just part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an infertile date because
before United States go literally
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated for out of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have a brand, you know,
this is our only good marketing strategy
[SPEAKER_01]: to start building a brand without
regulation, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that Cookies will be
related with other use, with recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also they are selling t-shirts,
cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are creating a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are creating a lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the regulation comes,
they will be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be already there, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So why has Cookies been able to expand so
rapidly as something that's in our head?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because they use a licensing model.
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes to Mike's point about brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies, there are some exceptions to what
I'm going to say, but Cookies doesn't own
[SPEAKER_05]: its cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies doesn't have its own licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies doesn't own its stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies just licenses the name and puts
requirements in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I get your exceptions to that
rule, but that's how they've been able to
[SPEAKER_05]: expand so rapid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to everyone's point here is they've
developed a lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've developed the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that brand start on the streets?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go to the consumers,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the other thing about
cannabis, because especially when you're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at intellectual property laws,
IP laws, whether there's a copyrights,
[SPEAKER_05]: trademarks, or other forms of patents,
a lot of those laws don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_05]: allow protection of certain cannabis IP
because of the fact that it's federally
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal in the United States and not
exactly legal or strictly legal in most
[SPEAKER_05]: other jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's hard to protect those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think that this is the
low-hanging fruit so to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: The additional stages of the industry are
how do you attract existing cannabis users
[SPEAKER_05]: away from the illicit market into the
regulated commercial market for tax
[SPEAKER_05]: generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, that's step one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then step two becomes how do you attract
new users?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you sub-classify users and make a
more sophisticated product, a more
[SPEAKER_05]: sophisticated brand for someone who
doesn't want to identify with the person
[SPEAKER_05]: on the street that's a Cookies culture for
example.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these things are evolving and it's
really, really interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, even though the question back,
how do you care about some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: How did that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not to be naysayered, but the
statement that, oh, sure, we still already
[SPEAKER_05]: have alcohol and we have tobacco,
that's their fault modelish out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: fly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough research.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some attached to the fact that if
the culprit is this number one,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're seeing tobacco it's getting more
and more stricter.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the point where even they think which
is not the Bible of this make-mean is now
[SPEAKER_05]: being, you know, really better
anti-history at a time, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, where do we got to rub alcohol?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we're pursued.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets too normalized and maybe we have
to restrict alcohol too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the battle lines around risk and
public health is around that restriction
[SPEAKER_05]: about polymer from you see across the
world and countless of pretty sample where
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, what he said to me,
pretty much destroyed by capitalist
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation state.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got the scores.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had gone out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice style is first is where illegal
punters have us out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live, you know, from my, they just did
this to be mount.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before I can have this idea of this
kind of these state regulation from the
[SPEAKER_05]: other was getting loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of it goes on as well that goes
to this notion that the regulations
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibit advertising in certain
jurisdictions are severely limited and
[SPEAKER_05]: they prevent what they store to do as the
treats it differently than any other
[SPEAKER_05]: store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't just go out and advertise
and market and brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your points are very little to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone have, please feel free to keep
asking questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did you think of our step and
twisted blends were there, your honor
[SPEAKER_04]: nasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when those you said it does air so
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire edition you've read it,
but do you see those and what actually
[SPEAKER_04]: read more so the offset and said to them
and call these are actually an
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-degrees of does they have more bring
in price than those rents.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and he created the case in the CBD
market where there's good B's out there to
[SPEAKER_04]: work and since she's having promise,
which supposed to be detained CBD in a
[SPEAKER_04]: very little.
[SPEAKER_04]: And air easy that to be combated at and
resolves the assumption industry run cross
[SPEAKER_04]: that that's what the consumer has no
balance in the products and they're just
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to play it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about a jump in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I would tell you this,
I would say that the yes, in the marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, it's in your interest to produce
the highest potency product at the lowest
[SPEAKER_05]: price point, because that is the basic
marketplace right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the reasons why Delta HHC these
have derived intoxicates are thriving in
[SPEAKER_05]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and around the world is because consumers
don't want to get this high consumers
[SPEAKER_05]: don't like paranoia consumers don't want
to walk into a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want something that's more like a
glass of wine versus a shot of whiskey.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a major difference out there in
terms of consumer behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to figure out what your
market is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But would you care to elaborate on that a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that it depends to find the market and
the and the rape and story structure in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of testing too high or testing too
little in Turks and THC content,
[SPEAKER_05]: because in the market in some states that
you get more price per pound for ounce per
[SPEAKER_05]: gram for higher THC product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's testing inflation that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, you want your brand to
have the highest amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in other states where and
jurisdictions where they're testing on the
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage of THC, then there's an
incentive for those to be lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when you think of policy around tax,
what does tax do?
[SPEAKER_05]: It either incentivizes or subsidizes
something to do to do something more or it
[SPEAKER_05]: punishes to do something less like high
taxes on cigarettes produced less
[SPEAKER_05]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, there's not a really good
strategy on how to tax this because the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators and the tax policy makers
really don't know what they want out of
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they don't have effective
strategies yet on, you know, what is the
[SPEAKER_05]: purpose of all of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're they're creating
distortions in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like I said, on the on the CPE
side, you know, that's been in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States, at least, relatively unregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there hasn't been any labeling truths
and label truth and products or anything
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's groups out there that that test
and rigorously test their products.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some instances, five or six times
throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's others that barely tested
at all, if at if at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you've got because of the lack of
regulation and oversight, you've got this
[SPEAKER_05]: market out there that's kind of kind of
the Wild West is a proof for all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of the the hemp to ride
cannabinoid producers and suppliers and
[SPEAKER_05]: retailers, they actually want to be
regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just like you said, you just don't
want to be too regulated or regulated like
[SPEAKER_05]: the Sketch of One truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so so it just depends upon what
the objective is and when the market is as
[SPEAKER_05]: to whether or not you're going to see
inflation in the testing or deflation of
[SPEAKER_03]: the testing and like.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have had so far a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right to you about Rachel's discussion on
mom in the dark room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look at the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to ask you kind of about what's
going on currently in the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a being has a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the major feature doing this for the
doubt, you know, notice the maceed record
[SPEAKER_03]: surprise for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the microphone, you know, going to his
period in salvation, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we know from the third year that there are
going to be some players are going to try
[SPEAKER_03]: to prove that they need to stay down
during the endless industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is everything that that's
going to come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think, you know, who's going to be the
most aggressive type players?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think will be, you know,
big tobacco, pharma, big alcohol,
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps equity firms?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we're running out of time
here, I'd like everybody to sort of hit
[SPEAKER_05]: this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can sort of round this out if that
works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you that I just wrote an
article.
[SPEAKER_05]: I read a forest color.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote an article in force where I
compare the first 10 years of the tech
[SPEAKER_05]: industry to the first 10 years in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it addresses some of these points.
[SPEAKER_05]: But think of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the bubble burst at the tech and the
tech Google, we didn't know what Google
[SPEAKER_05]: was.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know what that design was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things didn't exist at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those people after 10 years of the tech
industry went, this is over.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these people, who's going to be the
winner or the loser?
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is, you know, the winners and
the losers are going to be in Canada
[SPEAKER_05]: because everyone has to keep trying and
it's way too soon in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say the winner will be the company who
achieves to integrate social versatility,
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent marketing strategy, this company
needs to be one of the first ones because,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we think with the example of Gookies,
argument and disarguments, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this company needs to see what we're
being through in other markets in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: not repeat those mistakes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs to be a disruptive company,
which is lived by new minds, but all the
[SPEAKER_01]: times listening to the folders and
learning about the others, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but cannabis is a disruptive market in all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the reason why we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the ones that are going to succeed
are going to be the ones that have a good
[SPEAKER_05]: management.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, many people forget that the
state jobs, he have started Apple and
[SPEAKER_05]: built up it to a billion dollar company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he was fired by the board because
great visionary, but not an executive MBA
[SPEAKER_05]: to run a billion dollar enterprise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of these cannabis companies are
being run by inexperienced people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be changing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're four or four people from the food
and beverage industry are coming into the
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're demanding first, like ours to
produce data analytics for them to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: how much is this product selling for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I making money on this?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's my margin?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but what's my inventory?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's my all these things that they need
to know about their company in order to
[SPEAKER_05]: run it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, efficiently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think those are the ones that are
going to succeed along with the ones that
[SPEAKER_05]: have access to capital because right now
it's very difficult for cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_05]: to obtain Gacko when you can go ahead and
invest in a fortune 500 companies right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that down from their historic high
spot plates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that's with two things
that are going to, you know, outline if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to be hit in the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said in for years now that that
redefining firefighters in the Canada
[SPEAKER_05]: space will be branding scale and supply
chain management.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you can manage your brand,
get your brand out there, if you can scale
[SPEAKER_05]: it out, if you can manage your costs to
where you're made profitable, then you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be successful in this space with
respect to the jobs and the layoffs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the success to me is a natural
flow.
[SPEAKER_05]: What cannabis represents as an industry in
heck of a hence is called an
[SPEAKER_05]: entrepreneurial event.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's an opportunity to achieve
higher than normal profits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you achieve those and everybody
wants in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you've seen some people really on
that had the profits, but then everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: jumped in and took all the profits out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what what the results from that,
when everybody enters in this,
[SPEAKER_05]: it drives down their profitability and it
drives down their margins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that things consolidate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, there's this, you know,
period of multi phases of of expansion and
[SPEAKER_05]: consolidation, expansion and
consolidation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we're just in the earlier
phases of this right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm producing a job to court.
[SPEAKER_05]: This in conjunction with Leafley,
every yearly co-author, Joshua Fork.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're seeing is that similar to
what occurred in Canada early on with this
[SPEAKER_05]: expansion and installed capacity for
production capabilities in the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw that a bit with the multistate
outweighers to the United States,
[SPEAKER_05]: where they wanted to go into these new
larifx figuring that the demand will grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they installed the capacity.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now realizing that there's been a
little bit of a reset in the market,
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't mean to hire us to staff that
capacity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're they're just laying in
wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: But meanwhile, because the market is
starting to compress from a margin
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective and they're starting to have
to cut costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're seeing that there were jobs
added in 2022, but there was a lot they
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't add in more, but added not been
for the layoffs and other downsizing both
[SPEAKER_05]: as large of MSS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to
our wonderful panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to conclude this first
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, please give a round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
