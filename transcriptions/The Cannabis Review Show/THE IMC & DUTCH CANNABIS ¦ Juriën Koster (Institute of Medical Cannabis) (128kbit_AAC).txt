[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Uriain Koester who is the co-founder at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Institute for Medicinal Cannabis in
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IMC aims to improve the provision of
information about medicinal cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and prescribers and to help
strengthen the collaboration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: research and scientific network.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Uriain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi Uriain, good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a whole mouthful you just told me
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you very much for joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated and I know
you're a man with a wealth of information
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sure the audience are going to
love this quick chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
brief overview of how you got into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and where you are and
what companies you're a part of at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've joined the cannabis industry about
six years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out working for an extraction
facility very close to where I'm actually
[SPEAKER_01]: living in Wageningen in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wageningen, as people might know,
is the agricultural capital of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best agricultural university in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just turn the sound of my phone
off, my apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started out with an extraction
company that have developed their own
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction technology and it's different
from CO2 but uses basically some things
[SPEAKER_01]: are the same, some parameters are the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I started out six years
ago, started working with different kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis, both medical cannabis from
the Dutch government, bedrock cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also with outdoor hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with hemp for CBD extraction,
rolled into both markets, food supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: market and THC markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went on going from there and eventually
ended up founding the Institute for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal cannabis and working for a
lighting company where I do the strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where we do provide lighting to
conservation areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my expertise on cannabis and
cannabinoids makes the lighting and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis a very good fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also founded the Institute
officially last year in January,
[SPEAKER_01]: January 1st, 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: The year before we started having round
tables and just sort of organizing
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since last year we're now officially
in foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you seem to have some great partners
Transval Pharma, Bedrikan, Fagran and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of doctors and researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective with the Institute for
medicinal cannabis is to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: coalesce all these smart people with a lot
of research and data all in one
[SPEAKER_00]: centralized spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is the objective then to have software
where doctors around the country can dial
[SPEAKER_00]: in or is this based on information you're
gonna create papers and distribute those
[SPEAKER_00]: papers around?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the main thing is what you said is
cooperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are trying to cooperate between all
fields of the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's doctors, it's specialists,
it's pharmacists, it's academics,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also people from the industry,
it's the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need all of those to create a good
framework, a good legal framework,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also a framework for patients to
actually get product.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we are doing now is and
we are only a relatively small foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't charge a lot of money,
not at all even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't get paid anything as a board
member of the Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do this to improve the industry and
we don't provide with thousands and
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are doing is providing fact sheets
and we have the first two ones available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're for chronic pain and for
epilepsy, if I'm saying this correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing is we call the fact
sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's basically a sort of summary on
what is available for doctors and
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is currently the state of research
on chronic pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of products are being used?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the current state?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a very factual overview, not that you
need to use this or this is something,
[SPEAKER_01]: this counts as evidence, just a very good
overview, factual, the observative
[SPEAKER_01]: overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're currently creating those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other things we just
launched is, I don't know how this
[SPEAKER_01]: translates, but you always have this sort
of, you always have this piece of paper
[SPEAKER_01]: with your medicines, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it says, okay, this is the list of
side effects you might experience if you
[SPEAKER_01]: use this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the English word for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just a piece of paper with the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but some people, there's always very
tiny and very detailed and it's hard for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've now done is we've created a
very simple video of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a generic thing in the
Netherlands, which is available for all
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not branded in any way, not even by
us, not by anyone, which is just short
[SPEAKER_01]: three minute videos explaining cannabis,
cannabis floss or flower and cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just very simple, simple animated videos
for people to use, which they get a QR
[SPEAKER_01]: code from the pharmacy to get a cannabis
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can just view it online,
how to use it and what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just very, just provide information to the
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initial stepping stone of information
for a patient or a medical practitioner
[SPEAKER_00]: who's looking at the first level of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there another platform?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the one thing I'm starting to
notice, we're actually doing an article on
[SPEAKER_00]: software and cannabis now over the next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one thing I'm starting to see
movement in the European space because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The companies who are cultivating and
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the doctors don't have access to be
able to track prescriptions and track the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and track the behavior of each
patient, I see that's where the next move
[SPEAKER_00]: is coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you guys planning on building some
sort of software that allows the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: full access?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you guys initially just doing this
as, look, the industry needs to move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all come together to help this
industry move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the objective is not to turn this into
a large corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically to get the industry up off
the ground and help as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the latter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have also seen this conference that I've
seen this party is providing software and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're having now a startup phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even one of our partners is trying to set,
the Institute is trying to set it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we are as an organization really want
to remain a neutral, objective party,
[SPEAKER_01]: non-commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a partner of us provides a good
software that's functional and where this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of data can be exchanged,
we would promote it for the partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if somebody would reach out or
experts would reach out to us or
[SPEAKER_01]: specialists, where can I find this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would redirect them to the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not do this ourselves because we
think that's not our role.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be a facilitator and not an
actual player in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that the two pillars there
seem to can't cross either have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: offered an advice and be willing to
educate or you go for a monetization
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the two of those can
coalesce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can coalesce, but I don't think
you'll get taken seriously over the long
[SPEAKER_00]: term of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the way the route you guys are
taking is something that us in Ireland
[SPEAKER_00]: could learn from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there needs to be a board set up
independent of everybody's venture that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically helps the industry move forward
at no cost and at no gain to any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in some regards the same as in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of different parties
with a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it should be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set something up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of common ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found the common ground here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of common ground,
I'm sure, in Ireland as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did a conference last year in
Denmark where they invited us,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Institute, also to speak on what our
initiative is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year we were invited again to speak
on what we did in the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think every country can benefit from
such an initiative because there is a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of common ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to be taken seriously,
also by your own government, by the health
[SPEAKER_01]: care, then you need to provide a neutral
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come from a commercial aspect,
they just in very short, they will say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, he's just out here to make money and
he just wants to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his only goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you come more from a patient
perspective and more from a common ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: we notice these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the problem then was where
scientists had a hard time finding a
[SPEAKER_01]: product or where do I get the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do I get it from?
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that pharmacists don't know what to
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, doctors don't know what to
prescribe, so they ask the pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just, I think every country can
benefit from a facilitating place who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows where all the players are,
where the experts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of experts who are
affiliated with the Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they do cannabis research, we ask them
if they want to be an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's ever a topic like it's
chronic pain or MS or epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know, okay, you can contact this
specialist, ask his opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he can help you setting up a
research to just really facilitate and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think any country in the EU could benefit
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, very much agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move on now to just the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of questions about the
industry over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys produce enough cannabis for
your medical cannabis program or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: import as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, we export about 80% I think of the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So barocannabin export is the sole
producer at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a medical tender ongoing to have
two medical growers where, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: barocannabin is not 100% guaranteed to be
one of the two, but it's very likely there
[SPEAKER_01]: will be one of the two growers and so
there will be one new party providing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But currently almost every cannabis is
being exported.
[SPEAKER_01]: All cannabis is being, so officially the
cannabis for the Dutch government,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have the Office of Medicinal Cannabis,
gives basically what barocannabin is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a contract manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create, cultivate the cannabis for
the government and they distribute it and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the records of it are just online
findable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all transparent and most of our
cannabis goes to Germany actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany seems to be taking in cannabis
from Malta, from Denmark, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically have no cultivation
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have like three cultivators
and they produce a thousand or two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand kilograms each.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not 100% and that's not enough to
satisfy all their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to import it and they have
been importing it from the Netherlands for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we previously talked to Sonny
Murenhout from the Netherlands about
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and he gave us an overview of
a number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to the product in the
Netherlands, the pharmacies are the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that distribute the medical cannabis over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would get a prescription from your
doctor or from a specialist and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: could go to a pharmacist, any pharmacist
in the Netherlands where you can get the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis flower and the cannabis oil
is a bit more difficult because not all
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacists make the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's currently two who make the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also partners, the Transvaal and
the Clinical Cannabis Care where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get your cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to the pharmacies and
let's say the buyer for the pharmacies who
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting the new products that are
coming out, they really only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: company to supply them with product at the
moment, hopefully two within the next 12
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: They only have one and they're not even
directly because because it's being
[SPEAKER_01]: sourced from the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes from the cultivator to the
government, from the government to the
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor, from the distributor it goes
to the pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, basically one source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting because I think over in
Ireland we're going to have the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite scenario that whoever has the
Class A import license will then be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to source the best product for the
pharmacies to be able to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there'd be a cultivation
operation over in Ireland that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to be big enough to feed the whole
industry over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an ideal situation where you only
have one just from a risk perspective you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to differentiate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the cannabis currently being
provided by those governments is very good
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's GMP qualified flowers, so it's not an
issue in terms of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a you want a more diversified
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want more producers to see what you
can get, maybe some different strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kind of you just want to see
what's more possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think it doesn't even
necessarily need to be a better product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think it's going to be a better
product from any other producer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be able to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something our countries
eventually will go to where they also
[SPEAKER_01]: allow imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the Netherlands currently it's not
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very interesting to see what's
going on in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think there's a lot of
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it over in Ireland over the last
five to six months that it seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering behind Germany leading the way
with Germany are taking the headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we say with what's happening over
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to people are taking notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think New York is going to be a
massive one for the Irish people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look over to New York and Boston,
a good bit in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go live, I think, in like six weeks
now or eight weeks with retail stores in
[SPEAKER_00]: Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've been over there recently,
it's full of vans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's full of CBD stores selling TAC
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be interesting to see now
that cannabis tourism, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens between North America and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, Amsterdam is obviously a
massive spot for cannabis tourism and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still a lot going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the coffee shop experiments as
well in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things we don't have
time for to dive into, but it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting how to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say that on the German
possible legalization, let's not all focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on just Germany and just the pre-crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine is on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that we have an approved
cannabis medicine with Epidiolex from GW
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharma, which was on the main headlines of
2019, 2018, which is currently almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's forgotten by everybody in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So medical says a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would really, anybody who's listening
or viewing this like it's not just
[SPEAKER_01]: possible legalization in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other things happening in the
industry definitely as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think any good medical cannabis
program that has chronic pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic pain on it is going to allow
for a huge chunk of the legal market to be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned legal and for a lot of patients to
be able to access a medicine that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be beneficial to not everybody,
but for some of the patients, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've hit 15 minutes already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could actually fly along talking to you
at the moment for anybody who wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: know more about the Institute for
Medicinal Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the website below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend checking it out and
learning as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uriain, it's been great to talk to you
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to chat again in the next
six or eight months and see, get an update
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully we've got more news going on
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
