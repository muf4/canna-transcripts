[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Barry Pugson, who is a global cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: mergers and acquisitions consultant at
Hyde Advisory and Investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're based in Ontario and Canada and
are first advisors to the global cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and are well known throughout the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Barry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking the time to
join us on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking forward to talking to
you now about the wealth of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: information in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been in it for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you got involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry and how you ended up at
Hyde Advisory Investments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit of a long story and it comes
from a personal background.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter was my reason for entering the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was born nearly 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago with a condition called
Dravet syndrome, the same as Charlotte
[SPEAKER_00]: Figi out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much like their family, we were
scrambling for answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, this was kind of just
around the time 2012, 2013, where the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: industry was starting to take shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any access to it here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did actually a little bit of media at
the time on Kate's behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we ended up moving to Colorado,
got Kate started on CBD and kind of was
[SPEAKER_00]: there at the ground zero when things
started picking up in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up working with the largest CBD
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, spent the last nine or 10
years with them in various positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up in the last few years doing M&A
work on the Canadian side, trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them into Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as happens often in the cannabis
space, you know, strategy shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, regulations change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada no longer became kind of part of
their long term plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked for, you know, opportunities
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David Hyde, who's a big name in the
Canadian cannabis space, who I'd worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with previously, I reached out to him and
he was pivoting himself from more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: securities and regulatory consulting side
into the M&A space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had room on his team for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with Hyde Advisory since pretty
much the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we specialize in M&A work in
Canada and on the global side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's been an amazing
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, especially on the global side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, always exciting looking
into new countries with regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: changing, industries coming online and,
you know, working with people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for either investment or partners
and people that are looking to acquire or
[SPEAKER_00]: put a stake into an up and coming company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Hyde Advisory, you've got a great
reputation around the world for sure in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first thing I wanted to jump on to you
and talk about was cannabis merger
[SPEAKER_01]: acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've got a couple of questions that I
want to fly to on this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first and foremost, do you see
cannabis mergers and acquisitions only
[SPEAKER_01]: really starting to take place when the US
federally legalized cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have an opportunity then for
maybe the core brands to come to the fore
[SPEAKER_01]: through mergers and acquisitions of the
small or medium sized competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see Canada more looking towards
Europe and looking towards M&A's in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and Portugal and some of the
entities that are already set up over
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think it's a lot about
people hedging their bets on the US side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, there's no real,
you know, transparent future where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about to come online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it could be next year,
it could be five years, it could be 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the EU and the rest of the
globe, there's there's real legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and real, you know, real
progress being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know Germany is bringing
their rec market in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know Southeast Asia is starting to come
on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know Australia is getting serious in
South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until, you know, we see some kind of
movement in the US, it's really just still
[SPEAKER_00]: very much a pipe dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the meantime, you know, especially
Canadian companies, they're forced to look
[SPEAKER_00]: to the EU and to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to say that Canadian companies
aren't dipping a toe into the US market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still very much on a state by
state basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody's looking for a
nationwide strategy in the US because we
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't know what it's going to look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it seems Canada obviously
have the leg up, I think, on everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: with the access to capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the brands, let's say in
the States, even the likes of Cookies and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the larger operators, access to
capital wouldn't be as free flowing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I right in saying that or are these US
companies able to access capital outside
[SPEAKER_01]: their territory?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's twofold really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulatory wise, in Canada, it's very easy
to access capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the kind of crash and burn of the the
pubcos in Canada have really left a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: taste in Canadian investors' mouths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's free flowing capital in
Canada, you know, there's not as much
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite here anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the US, you're right,
there's regulatory hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of US investors are chomping at
the bit for ways to invest in new cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's roadblocks in their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very different animals,
Canada and the US, in terms of access to
[SPEAKER_00]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell me this, if you're, let's say,
a piece of advice for a cannabis company
[SPEAKER_01]: that's growing, what is the right time to
merge?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the right time to acquire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a template or a specific goal and
rule that you generally tend to companies
[SPEAKER_01]: to look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it on a case by case basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly there's a case by case
element to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if I was thinking on
general terms in a global M&A opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm somebody that's looking to be
acquired, I find there's there's a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of a wave, so to speak, in your
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the early startup phase where
you're raising capital or you have lack
[SPEAKER_00]: thereof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really just have these big,
wonderful plans to build a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some of the right people in place
and the groundwork for the licensing and a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent relationship with the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stuck between a rock and a hard
place in terms of your financing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's the opportunity to bring
somebody in that has some experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has some capital, and you're going to
give away a bit more of your company to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're able to navigate that hurdle
and get an operational facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: have some historical revenue, really be at
the top of your game and have something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's attractive, a good example of that
right now is a facility in the EU that can
[SPEAKER_00]: do post-harvest processing and is GMP
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is the perfect time to look to be
acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: A company like Materia did just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the later stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're seeing that a lot in Canada,
where you've laid the foundation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've built something beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been operational.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for whatever reason, your business
model is not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The margins aren't there or the regulatory
burden is too great and you can't make a
[SPEAKER_00]: run of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now your sales are declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lease payment is up for renewal and
you have to make an exit or else you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to have to put the for sale
sign up and sell it as a property and just
[SPEAKER_00]: abandon the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly the very middle,
where your revenue is on point and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have something that a lot of people want,
that would be the Goldilocks time to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can admit that Materia have been
working on their project pretty hard over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you see that basically these
post-harvest processing facilities are
[SPEAKER_01]: more in point with everybody compared to,
let's say, the cultivation facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the post-harvesting processing you
think is where the demand for Europe is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be because the ability to ship in
low-cost product around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think the shipping costs and the
ability to ship and keep a turbine and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profile exact over the course
of, let's say, two weeks shipping over the
[SPEAKER_01]: boat, over the sea, is that the way to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think the cultivation in Europe
is going to end up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the long term, I will
certainly, yes, where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating in the domestic market they're
serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, there's a lot of people
interested in growing cannabis in very
[SPEAKER_00]: low-cost environments like South America
and Africa and shipping it to the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: During your post-harvesting there,
the shipping costs on top of the low cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of production are still far below what it
would cost to cultivate in the EU GMP
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the short term, I think it's still
very much part of a lot of companies'
[SPEAKER_00]: business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the longevity of it, yeah,
it's probably not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many governments are probably going to
start catching on to this little greenwash
[SPEAKER_00]: technique and putting in some regulations
to block that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next topic I wanted to jump on to,
which one pretty much every entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis industry would like to get
an answer to, and it's access to capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going to bore you with trying
to tell me where you get access to
[SPEAKER_01]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give you five different
potential businesses that they were to
[SPEAKER_01]: come in in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one of these five would be most
likely to obtain funding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So option one is a biotechnology company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biosynthesizing cannabinoids requires
double to the deck a million, shall we
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second option would be somebody who's got
a cultivation operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got their own genetics that they
want to IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other option then is somebody who
wants to open up a chain of dispensers,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with CBD, obviously in Ireland,
and to move it towards THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one would be a
laboratory that does the testing
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities and does governmental contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which of those four businesses do you
think is right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that I put my money onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you like to split money across
all four of them, if the four of them came
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also be curious where these
markets are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would play into it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it Europe because the audience
would be European and we're an Irish media
[SPEAKER_01]: presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of Europe in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I think if it was me, I would split
it between the biotech and the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that everybody can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of biotech, you're going to get
quite a bit of IP and stuff that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: easily duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail chains are a tough game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy answer in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stay well away from a retail chain
or cultivation, even with their own
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary strengths, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think the future is biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm investing for the long term,
that's where I'd probably put 80% into
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech and 20% for lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab testing, the future is a little bit,
I think it's a very important element to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're very dependent on government
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could be the most important part of
the value chain, depending on what the
[SPEAKER_00]: government requires of cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could be just one of 100 if it's a
very simple COA that you're producing with
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, CBD and pesticides and microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the UK, lab testing is looking like
it's going to be very important for CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: with novel foods in whichever direction
they go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would hedge my bets and have
some form of split between the first and
[SPEAKER_00]: the last option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I let you go quick, when you
mentioned the UK there, as somebody who
[SPEAKER_01]: owns another business who deals with the
UK post-Brexit, I'm fully too aware of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nightmare that involves dealing business
from the UK to the EU now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do investors in North America see this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they realise the extra added tax that
gets involved in the exchanges between the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Union and the UK now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or does it matter to them that just the UK
has been a market on its own to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: set up its standalone entity in the UK and
a standalone one in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the educated North American
company appreciates that they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: separate markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be beneficial to have,
if you are truly a global player,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have an asset in the UK and a second
asset in the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know of a few companies that the UK
is their end goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happy to just put their flag in
the UK and try and make that market work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the intrinsics of transport between
the UK and the EU, no, I wouldn't say your
[SPEAKER_00]: typical North American company would
understand everything that's involved
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big part, not to digress too much,
but a big part of the global M&A play from
[SPEAKER_00]: a North American company is to have not
just the asset, but a team that's already
[SPEAKER_00]: in place that either is going to do a nice
long transition so they can learn as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as they can from them before they leave or
somebody that they can retain that has
[SPEAKER_00]: that knowledge about the markets that
they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we see Ireland being the footstone
into Europe for a lot of the North
[SPEAKER_01]: American companies with our trade or
highly skilled workforce and only English
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking entity in Europe at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Ireland is going to play a pivotal
role over the course of the next 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be championing Ireland from the
Canada's view over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you very much for taking your
time, Barry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk to you all day about access
to capital and mergers and acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully, maybe we can touch base and
start it next year and have an update and
[SPEAKER_01]: see where everybody's play is at when it
comes to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
