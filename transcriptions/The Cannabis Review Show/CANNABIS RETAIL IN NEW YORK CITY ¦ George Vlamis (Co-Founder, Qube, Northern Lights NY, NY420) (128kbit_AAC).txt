[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to this episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
George Vlamis, who's the co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cube Northern Lights New York 420 Media
and Farmer's Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, George?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well, doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking time to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know things are all busy with you over
in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very busy over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a new lawsuit that just hit,
so all of the licenses are currently on
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping that clears up soon,
but still moving forward here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking to John Perot, one of the
legal experts from New York on that topic
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly today as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we get some insights from a
legal perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'll be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be nice to see what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of how you ended up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and why and what
companies you decided to create in that
[SPEAKER_00]: space?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the cannabis industry on the
other side for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Massachusetts legalized,
I moved there and we started a cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: situation to learn the legal landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we waited for New York to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when New York opened,
we really hit the ground running.
[SPEAKER_01]: We secured several prime real estate
locations early on before any of the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: were even released and positioned
ourselves to really enter this space
[SPEAKER_01]: across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are positioned now in multiple
locations from the state's capital,
[SPEAKER_01]: Albany, New York, all the way down to
Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a big presence in the mid
Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have Cube, where I'm partners with
Coirn Liddell in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have Northern Lights NY,
where I am partners with Joe Kelly in
[SPEAKER_01]: Albany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have another site coming online in
Fishkill, New York, New Paul's New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Newburgh, New York at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we created Quan and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: We founded NY420, where we put up a
website where we allow anybody in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space in New York that's
participating to have free advertising and
[SPEAKER_01]: showcase their brand, everything that
they're doing, a link to where they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a website where people entering
the space can come and basically find
[SPEAKER_01]: every service you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: To open up a dispensary in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might start off with Cube as our first
topic of discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chain of dispensaries that you're
going to have throughout New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: clear New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the purchasing process when
you're deciding what kind of flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of products are stocked at Cube?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a good relationship with a
lot of the cultivators and processors now
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last couple of years since they
started coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we inspect everybody's product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sit down with them and we see what they
have available at the moment and what they
[SPEAKER_01]: have coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all the sites that I work with,
all the partners that I have, we really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to let the public know that we want
to push fresh product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're coming and you're buying
flour from one of our sites, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be fresh flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be a year old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we work with the cultivators
is we try to tell them, look, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to have space on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to support you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to have fresh product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not looking to take in last year's
crop and we want that to transpire with
[SPEAKER_01]: the customer coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always looking to try and bring
in new and exciting products as fresh as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the cultivation of
flour and the products that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: accessing, is it all coming from New York
farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have to purchase from New York
cultivators and processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there specific companies that are
standing in the rest when there seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the cultivation in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it a case where we're in Canada,
we're going to see the smaller operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more craft operators produce the
better quality flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's very early on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how comfortable I feel
calling everybody out and saying who's
[SPEAKER_01]: better than who.
[SPEAKER_01]: But listen, there are definitely some
companies that are much larger than
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who have very small
craft operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have a mix of both,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have people that can
supply, you know, two, three hundred skews
[SPEAKER_01]: for your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have people that
specialize in two or three that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: supremum quality compared to everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be a healthy mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there are a handful of
companies that I think are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to the current retail
landscape in New York, we obviously have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a lot of illegal operation opened up
within some smart policy work by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Commission in New York looking to
try and close these down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the current retail landscape
look like in Manhattan at the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the rest of the state?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, listen, the the Office of Cannabis
Management, the governor, all the powers
[SPEAKER_01]: that may be in New York state,
they're going to do the best they can to
[SPEAKER_01]: minimize these illegal shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, unfortunately, at the moment,
Manhattan is flooded with them wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you if you pick a spot,
you pick a street, you know, within a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of feet, couple of minutes,
you know, you can find plenty of places to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase all kinds of cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty four seven here, you know,
that are not licensed operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have we with the licenses have to trust
that the customer is going to want to shop
[SPEAKER_01]: to purchase a product that New York state
has tested and has confirmed there are no
[SPEAKER_01]: other narcotics in the mix and it is a
safe product to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what we have to really tell the
public who's shopping buy from a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tested product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's safe to consume the illegal shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing what they got to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak on what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't own one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wish them the best of luck in
making the transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish New York state the best of luck in,
you know, minimizing their exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And collecting tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting, interesting landscape in
Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I was there last year and it
was pretty comical to see the explosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: the proliferation of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it a case of it's currently just
whack a mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police are closing down and they're
just finding a new retail outlet and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to make the money as quickly
as they can until they get closed down
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, listen to shut what's going down
in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need nothing short of the National
Guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've got to close the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a couple of military units and
you have to attack Manhattan for a good
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three days and shut down thousands of
stores, shutting down two or three here or
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you're done doing the
paperwork, five more have opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you've got to call in
special forces and really show your power
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, shut them down in a week and be
fucking around for, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to come in and do what you got to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are one of the card applications
when it comes to the licensing in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the current landscape look like
for the recipients that are already opened
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it been a big success for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you looking forward to seeing what
it's going to bring for you the next 12 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, listen, from what I understand,
the licensed operators that have been open
[SPEAKER_01]: making sales, they're doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: The customers are loving the stores,
loving the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very fun business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're moving as fast as we
can to become one of them and start sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that, you know, for the next
three to five years, New York is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: become what everybody thinks it is,
one of the largest markets in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're very excited to see the sales
and to interact with all the people and
[SPEAKER_01]: the brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very fun space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, very excited for what's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can only imagine one of the places
that always stuck out to me when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the consumption lounges or even bars
that are now licensed towards cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to Alexandre Rissinger who owns
the first cannabis hotel, the Lexi in Las
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing in the back of my mind
was, if you combine the culture and the
[SPEAKER_00]: music with a consumption lounge in New
York, surely that's going to be the next
[SPEAKER_00]: big wave of cannabis businesses who can
marry those two sectors together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from what I understand now,
our card license allows for limited
[SPEAKER_01]: on-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the sites that I have,
we are preparing them to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: independent space where you can come and
consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're waiting on further
regulation from the Office of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Management to really explain what that
entails and what limits we have to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, New York is going to be a
very exciting market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to go into Manhattan, purchase a
product, and then go into somebody's
[SPEAKER_01]: creative space where it was designed to
entertain you while you're consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, that's going to be something
that's going to be developing over the
[SPEAKER_01]: next five, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to be amazing to
watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think from this side of the pond,
it's one of those, if New York didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: already have enough unique selling points,
that being able to go to Manhattan and,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, go to one of these lounges,
whatever part of the scale it ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: being on and being able to enjoy that
product and the consumption mixed with the
[SPEAKER_00]: media over there, I think is going to be
very advantageous for holidaymakers and
[SPEAKER_00]: for tourism for the sector as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a huge market.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to come from all over the
world to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see now, because it's legal,
is Tom, Dick and Harry's got sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: name trying to get their foot in the door
of this sector now, or is it still got a
[SPEAKER_00]: high enough barrier to entry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the barrier to entry really is the
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, if you're an
entrepreneur, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate any business you want to enter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people want to enter the space
that haven't been in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is my first time in the
space, but it's, you know, it's easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The state issues regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow the fucking rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know how to read, you can operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your average person,
they want to talk, or even people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: space, they tell you, oh, it's a hard
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've never been in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is easy shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow what the state says.
[SPEAKER_01]: You raise some money and you open a
business like it's anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who wants to enter the space,
find your money, read the regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a creative session, come up with what
you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, we're selling
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow the rules and you keep your
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the actual retail
locations in Manhattan, I was reading up a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of rules of it has X amount of
meters or distance away from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that people have been
very picking the retail locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what the parameters were for these
retail locations in Manhattan?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your input on choosing the retail
location in Manhattan?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think the rules are 500 feet
from any school and the school,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's defined K through 12,
200 feet from any house or warship.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a thousand feet, at least from
Manhattan, a thousand feet from any other
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you follow those parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state put out a new search tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you a heads up if the location is
compliant and then you can proceed forward
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to their survey tool and actually
submit the site if you have a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the race for real estate
in Manhattan, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once again, it comes down to
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you knock on somebody's door
before you buy a hot dog to stand across
[SPEAKER_01]: the street and look and envision where you
could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need 200,000 to a million dollars
just for a security deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna need a high net worth
individual to sign for the real estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is really the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding the locations, they're available,
they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The office issued a lot of licenses from
Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Manhattan has a huge market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, it comes down to finding
the right partners for your business or
[SPEAKER_01]: just being an individual that is already
self-sufficient when it comes to the real
[SPEAKER_01]: estate in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be able to write a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't write a check, whether it's
your money or someone else's money,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's just a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to secure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the cash money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go, I know you're a busy
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the thing you're looking forward
to seeing over the next 18 months in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, you said the next, how long?
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 to 18 months, 24 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see everybody open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see myself open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to see the support we have
from the residents of New York and the
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding states and all the
international travelers come and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience the amazing brands that pop up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love for all the cultivators and
processors to have an abundance of
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries to sell to and see them
stabilize their situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our farmers need stores to sell to in
order to get back the investment and be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to maintain their financial
responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to the grower
showcases that the state is allowing where
[SPEAKER_01]: we can have these independent events
offsite from the dispensary with music.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much exciting stuff here,
but I really just want to see the market
[SPEAKER_01]: come alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Office of Cannabis Management
has been tasked with a crazy set of
[SPEAKER_01]: scenarios here to open up the largest
consumption market on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing the best they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the OCM.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pivoting every time they have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making adjustments every time they
have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're battling lawsuits and they're
doing the best that they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I praise them for the work that
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to see this market open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And congratulations to everybody who's in
the space or coming in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to have an invite about,
you know, four or 500 people here to our
[SPEAKER_01]: rooftop grand open event for Cube in
Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a big party plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: When's that happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping at some time before Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what happens with this current
lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be delayed a little bit,
but we have an amazing venue, 25 stories
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are allowed to bring three,
400 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to really invite the industry
and kind of make it one of the premier
[SPEAKER_01]: gatherings and grand openings that New
York has seen for one of these retail
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm over in New York pretty
regularly, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting up in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, hopefully we can talk face
once Cube is opened up and we can get an
[SPEAKER_00]: update on how business is going for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, thank you very much for your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
