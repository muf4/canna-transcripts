[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you motherfucker give me two secs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to do that again Welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cannabis review every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Connor McLeod He's the founder and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: man TV based it in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey keeping today Connor mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very well man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am fantastic man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much for taking the time to do
this Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very much delighted to have you on
so I was doing a good bit of research in
[SPEAKER_01]: in media and cannabis and I came across a
lot of your series and Found some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I'd get you on and we can get
a have a little discussion on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: media Do you maybe want to give everybody
a quick little overview of how you ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the industry and and starting up
kind of on TV?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly essentially like most of
us been smoking since I was about 14 15
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing consuming the whole time and
As time goes on you kind of find yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: in a position where you take a direction
of things that you're passing So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided to you know Bring it into a
into something entertainment based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, it's been good the kind of man
TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really a consequence of a
Forethought really so the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has kind of been in its infancy
the whole time and as it's been emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that's consuming cannabis is aware
that you know, it's only at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: stages, so I thought Apply a passionate
element into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been in the drawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the same time as a consuming
cannabis I started to Make the comics over
[SPEAKER_00]: this site here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these comics here and I started
making them and they develop it into an
[SPEAKER_00]: animation series and as a consequence of
trying to make it visible to the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: I create the podcast and As a kind of like
a trajectory for the animation series and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's taken a long time to get to a stage
where the animations is ready So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: only been the past year one halfway
through season two So so yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the engines running and yes, it's good to
see where it's going Yeah, it's great to
[SPEAKER_01]: see I think Once you get into the in the
content side of things you kind of realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that at 50 100 episodes is when you'll
actually Start to get comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that it's gone a couple of
little questions on your episodes Like how
[SPEAKER_01]: long does each episode take to make from
the start of the idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: To the end and the production and
post-production a month So it's four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: for four solid weeks like essentially I'll
come with the idea each the other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll point out as well at the moment and
I'm working through season two So season
[SPEAKER_00]: two and each one of the animations That's
up and at the moment from season one scene
[SPEAKER_00]: one season one and season two is
essentially An animation adapted from this
[SPEAKER_00]: comic book here that one there
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's 14 and original kind of
man comics that's in that book and That
[SPEAKER_00]: took about 14 months because each one of
the comics was a month to make And so then
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the intention the foundation was
for the comics that I've then adapted them
[SPEAKER_00]: at the animation series So I'm on episode
11, which is season 2 episode 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is comic 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got three more after this And that
we've seen season two finished and I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: all the original comics will be done and
of from the original comic books and and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be working on season three and but a
month per episode for animation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea the storyboard but Essentially
because of the fact that these are adapted
[SPEAKER_00]: from the comic book series I don't need to
do a storyboard because the storyboards
[SPEAKER_00]: the comic itself So, um, so one season
three arrives when all the original comics
[SPEAKER_00]: are done That'll be exciting because
that'll be completely new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no comics based on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like My intention is to create
kind of like a format switch season is
[SPEAKER_00]: seven episodes and for seen for season
three the seven episodes are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in correlation with the seven principles
of the hermetic philosophy and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to essentially intertwine the cannabis
rhetoric cannabis narrative contemporary
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis information on top of the seven
principles of the hermetic philosophy
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would kind of be you know be
interesting be fun and I find both and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about both and And yeah,
so it's a month per episode and at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment I'm on Comic 11 essentially episode
11 So, um, but I don't know if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: aware and I've mentioned on a couple of
other podcasts But I'm actually working on
[SPEAKER_00]: the can man movie that we ready at the end
of August and and that's say I'm on about
[SPEAKER_00]: seen for and seen four of nine and again
each scene takes a month and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's interesting about the process of
creating the comics is that inevitably
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been a Each comic has been a
precursor to the episode and the episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: been a precursor to the scenes So it's
really a domino effect and it's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating and Process because it's not
exclusive to even animation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be with any craft any endeavor
There's a whatever you do in the micro is
[SPEAKER_00]: represented in the macro, you know and the
micro in this case is the the single panel
[SPEAKER_00]: comics then I went on to the full comics
and then the macro in this sense as the as
[SPEAKER_00]: the movie which is a Let's say that's
going to be That's going to be a belter
[SPEAKER_01]: when that arrives And you also wrote a
book a case for cannabis if I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: mistaken Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the reason behind that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a long process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it just trying to get your thoughts
out on paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a an actual specific strategic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to convince an argument to this
type of audience essentially the the case
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis was written in 2019 2000 and
the end of 2018 2019 and the reason why I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote it was because I Was putting the
planning into doing the channel So I was
[SPEAKER_00]: linking myself with most people that are
cannabis orientated if you promote any
[SPEAKER_00]: form of discussion Based on cannabis to
the layman.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll think that you're just promoting
something that you like so inevitably
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna be biased So I was like,
well, I don't have any credentials There's
[SPEAKER_00]: no academic background for any form of
science or chemistry or biochemistry So I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, what can I do to prove to
provide a foundation of professionalism?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a white coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no that would help and so I was
like well if I create a book and This this
[SPEAKER_00]: academically referenced then I'll be able
to promote myself in a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: professional manner when the channel
arrives So I was like it took me four and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half five months to write and the a case
for cannabis and that was about three
[SPEAKER_00]: months before I started the channel And
the case for cannabis essentially as a
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like 10 11 chapters each chapter is
relevant to a main talking point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world So it's essentially the
best way to describe the book is it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad spectrum analysis of all the main
issues relating to cannabis So you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a chapter on endocannabinoid system a
chapter on the terpenes a chapter on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids medicinal value a chapter on
recreational cannabis Sorry recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: substance use and inside that chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed researching for that one
because what I found was I essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: compared cannabis consumption in a
recreational format to other recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, but I used alcohol I also use
caffeine and energy drinks and the context
[SPEAKER_00]: of caffeine and Everybody's aware that
these things are kind of detriment to your
[SPEAKER_00]: health But I had no idea that I mean the
caffeinated energy drinks are responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for deaths You know kind of like energy
drinks have killed people and yet these
[SPEAKER_00]: things are readily available on the shop
And then we've got this cannabis this this
[SPEAKER_00]: very natural plant, which is a boost to
your physiology, which is still prohibited
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still the information is still being
pushed underground intentionally So um,
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah, the book was essentially a
cathartic release of information I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting over the course of years and
then I put a really concerted effort
[SPEAKER_00]: focused effort over the course of four
months to accommodate all the contemporary
[SPEAKER_00]: research and put it into the book and
Yeah, I'm delighted with it to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only thing I would say is because
of the fact that I had nobody to proofread
[SPEAKER_00]: it When going from one chapter to the next
it's kind of intense, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no breathing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not any like sidestep or It's just
intensive fucking academically referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, but that's good and you can
get on Amazon if anybody's interested
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely We've been putting up the
link to all of the places of content for
[SPEAKER_01]: Connor in the description on whether it's
YouTube or Spotify wherever you are It is
[SPEAKER_01]: funny to see the hypocrisy from some side
of the things We can already point to
[SPEAKER_01]: three and a half thousand deaths a year
from alcohol in Ireland yet Our tea shock
[SPEAKER_01]: is out opening up a distillery for whiskey
and at the same time trying to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is bad It resonates to take
across the whole world the hypocrisy from
[SPEAKER_01]: one side to the other It's bizarre.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really bizarre and I could
see why individuals who are Not informed
[SPEAKER_00]: about the the the chemical basis of the
plant and they have no knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis I can see why they're kind of
consumed by the rhetoric that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: a drug It's bad for you and all these kind
of things because you've essentially got a
[SPEAKER_00]: society that promotes Poisonous material
under the basis of tax really these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know I'm pretty certain
alcohol the legislation behind alcohol And
[SPEAKER_00]: it's based under a category of like time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like 80 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still legitimate I could be wrong and
but there's there's there's peculiar
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation that's related to substances
which are poisonous and yet there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression of information for this plant,
which is beneficial literally crucial I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean an interesting thing that I find most
explicit when I was writing the book was
[SPEAKER_00]: that Cannabis is not only crucial to
endocannabinoid system cannabis and a
[SPEAKER_00]: consequence of researching the plant
itself We discovered more about our own
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't know about the
endocannabinoid system We discovered parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of our body and put in a crucial the
master controller as a consequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis like so we we find out more about
the human race as a consequence of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and yet You're still punished for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people in prison for it And you
know people are dying because they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get access to it, you know And that's why
let's say things like what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the cannabis media thing It's so
crucial to kind of break the stigma and
[SPEAKER_00]: they I think personally that the the
stigma and then the narrative that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a Negative thing will still be
present long after the legislation is
[SPEAKER_00]: passed and makes it more favorable You
know, it's it's had a really profound
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on the psyche of society Yeah,
it is gas to think that stuff like magic
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms could just breeze by legislation
Whereas cannabis is this moral compass of
[SPEAKER_01]: wrongdoing but that's neither here nor
there as you were stating cannabis media
[SPEAKER_01]: is where we kind of need to focus and
that's the next thing I wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about is the cannabis media content on a
global scale I thought about you but I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't be more underwhelmed by the
content that comes out of America and
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada from like companies that are
supposedly worth tens of millions or
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of millions that They don't have
a couple of thousand to be able to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: good content on a weekly by weekly or even
monthly basis What are your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis media content?
[SPEAKER_01]: and overview of the global industry Very
similar quite honestly, I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: woefully out of touch when it comes to
really any entertainment based outside Of
[SPEAKER_00]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't even really pay much
attention I spend so much time focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing and creating animation which is
kind of in concert with your comment
[SPEAKER_00]: really because at the same time is that
there's not really a Significant presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to construct it independently
As we spoke just before camera like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the the two did you all see it in
Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Guy and a girl from America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're in very good work that
really professional high-end shows some of
[SPEAKER_01]: its hilarious as well like that,
but you're you're scraping that like
[SPEAKER_01]: Single-digit kind of performers or YouTube
channels or whatever it may be not even
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily main big budget content It
just seems to be that there's not even
[SPEAKER_01]: brands behind content creators that are
sponsoring their channels or wherever it
[SPEAKER_01]: may be do you think that's just a lack of
federal legislation in America and a lack
[SPEAKER_01]: of clarity in Europe or the budgets aren't
just even there or the people running them
[SPEAKER_01]: just Don't have a clue really how to run a
cannabis business for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer industry To be honest,
I think it could probably be a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things legislative, but I think a
lot of time the big mainstream cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people that are behind these kind of
things are kind of it could be that stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: in their ways So like high times or other
individuals that they've been producing
[SPEAKER_00]: content in a particular way for so long
That is very difficult to kind of become
[SPEAKER_00]: novel, you know It's very difficult to
break out of the the discipline in which
[SPEAKER_00]: you've made yourself in the first place
and I think that's where podcasts or
[SPEAKER_00]: independent media They seem so unique and
they're so necessary because that's their
[SPEAKER_00]: that's they came into the the cannabis
space with that as their their creative
[SPEAKER_00]: outlet whereas these other Creative brands
and that are talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking predominant predominantly
magazine based really I mean, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to go from being a predominantly
magazine orientated Production to then
[SPEAKER_00]: going right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's now sponsor to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do this So it could just be it
could just be aged and production,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it could just be that And I do
also think as well that it's kind of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know There is so much caution around how
you speak about cannabis that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes either not to engage in
conversation It's sometimes either not to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce that kind of content because you
could maybe make a difference You can only
[SPEAKER_00]: make something wrong or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like let's just we'll stick with
what we're doing and that'll be safe We've
[SPEAKER_00]: got enough numbers and just kind of more
of a cautionary approach than one that
[SPEAKER_00]: should be innovative Or one that should be
more focused on the fact that let's break
[SPEAKER_00]: the boundaries of how the discussions been
taking place Yeah, it seems to me it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just very strange if you take something
like M&A for example, you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: DraftKings will sponsor 10 of the biggest
podcasts and I have a blanket let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: advertisement of all the main consumers in
that industry you'll get the same with
[SPEAKER_01]: Coca-Cola and FIFA and a number of other
big brands it just doesn't seem to be that
[SPEAKER_01]: they either haven't copped on to the
opportunity that's there because
[SPEAKER_01]: Investment from brands will help grow a
channel which will help grow the audience
[SPEAKER_01]: and and vice versa I think there's a
massive opportunity there for marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: officers or content officers of companies
to People like yourself people like Martin
[SPEAKER_01]: that we spoke about there's a number of
other Top podcasts like the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with a Rouge and a couple of
other guys So it would be good to see some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the money flowing in towards the
content creation side of things and pick
[SPEAKER_01]: up the speed in this industry That's
actually a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point And they I am all for
somebody to sponsor the kind of man stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking right bring this bring the fucking
money over as necessary because then let's
[SPEAKER_00]: be honest We're all doing this for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a this is a passion-led endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like you've got to try and pay the
rent at the same time as doing this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that'd be a Fantastic boost to what
is everybody's doing because you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: provide more of an authenticity if you've
been sponsored But going back to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned about the legislation barriers,
that's potentially reason why that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: happened So if you're a if you're an
organization and you're sponsoring private
[SPEAKER_00]: and Independent media that's based on a
plan or a substance that's illegal in the
[SPEAKER_00]: region that they're producing of content
That's kind of conflicting to your
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing strategy, you know, it's very
difficult to make that, you know And as
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when it comes to anything like
financial transactions that's based on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis any form of financial transaction
with cannabis that's based on a region
[SPEAKER_00]: that's Prohibiting it immediately banks
are fucking not taking that on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean that's shut it down And
so I think the amount of barriers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in place and could potentially be the main
reason why that's not happened And yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I hope it changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do Yeah, well, I think we're one
good piece of legislation whether it be in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Czech Republic be it in Germany be it
in Federal legalization the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: away from a lot of M&A activity and a lot
of more movement and the consumer being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to benefit from the Revenue and
capital that the companies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: selling them products for should be able
to benefit from there should be loyalty
[SPEAKER_01]: rewards content concerts There should be
tons of things that are being done for the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer that are actually spending the 10
euro or $10 per gram on on specific type
[SPEAKER_00]: of flour I feel agree and just going back
to actually what I said before about the
[SPEAKER_00]: movie One of the things I'm hoping to
achieve is to get him legitimate sponsors
[SPEAKER_00]: and through cannabis businesses or
organizations for the movie itself and to
[SPEAKER_00]: then promote it and Essentially regionally
through the UK also internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my intention is to hopefully get into
like the Montreal Film Festival or
[SPEAKER_00]: Adelaide And I'm hoping to get a view down
to product Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a numerous independent cinemas
around Scotland and Northern England as
[SPEAKER_00]: well that I'm hoping to get viewed because
essentially that the basis of the movie is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to resonate with Everybody that say
has any form of knowledge of cannabis at
[SPEAKER_00]: all like the main body in the movie people
are going to know immediately Why is the
[SPEAKER_00]: body the fundamental story behind what why
kind of man is who he is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately people are going to be like oh
fuck it like this is going to click so
[SPEAKER_00]: many things for people and Interestingly
as well the movie even though it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: very explicit Cannabis theme the bodies
Cannabis themed two bodies are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: assumed actually the heroes Cannabis
themed his his role before he became
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannamans Cannabis themed there is a On
top of that and undertone essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath that explicit and template is a
story Which is based in all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: journeys in life where each single one of
us is walking through life with a quest of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're doing here Why is it we're
doing what we're doing and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the philosophers journey
That's what you're dealing with and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're aware of or not All of us
are walking through life with this
[SPEAKER_00]: existential pursuit of meaning and and
that's the nature of what the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: movie is it says an existential film and
with humor and a you know It's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: swearing all the way through it Let's be
honest and they on top of that is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and story, you know
Pharmaceutical basis and all this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be a big deal this year
That's going to be a really exciting thing
[SPEAKER_00]: when that's released and it won't be
available online immediately and it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially doing a tour around the UK
cinema wise and then after that most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely it'll be through PayPal or
something like that like a download
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription thing what about ten or you
can watch at one time and but that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be That's going to be in the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the Cheeching chong
animation and 20 years time people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be talking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is what this is mate I
absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it the minute the stuff that you've
got going on It's great to see and hear
[SPEAKER_01]: and as I said if the cannabis for you can
help in any way shape or form Promote or
[SPEAKER_01]: get the name out with it and you just let
us know we'd be there to do for you I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that a lot, you know Let's see
once it's ready a few months because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping to do like kind of like a podcast
tour And when it's beginning when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost ready, so I've been more than happy
I'd be delighted to come back on and speak
[SPEAKER_01]: to you You can guarantee that but for now
it's we're just At our time, so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have to say goodbye We'll definitely have
a chat in a couple of weeks or a month or
[SPEAKER_01]: so when you're getting the tour going and
I definitely love to have another chance
[SPEAKER_01]: being great talking to you Connor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy days until next episode everybody
You You
