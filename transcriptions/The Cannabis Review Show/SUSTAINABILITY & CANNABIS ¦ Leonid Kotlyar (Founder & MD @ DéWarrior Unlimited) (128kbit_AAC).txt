[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis View.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Leonid Kotlar, who's the founder and
[SPEAKER_00]: managing director at The Warrior Unlimited
BV.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Warrior is a seed IPO management
consultancy firm at the intersection of ag
[SPEAKER_00]: tech sustainability and cannabis
innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Leonid?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing very well, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on to cover this
topic that I'm sure a lot of people want
to hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't get too much information on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
little brief overview of how you came to
[SPEAKER_00]: set up The Warrior and the main objectives
of the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came from a career of institutional
finance and happened to join the firm that
[SPEAKER_01]: was at the start of the Who Cares Wins
paper that really began the ESG movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started in Morgan Stanley,
ESG and looking after sensitive accounts
[SPEAKER_01]: from the point of view of ESG compliance
and management, it was something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: always had an eye into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2013, when Colorado and Washington
state were legalizing in the US and I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: a need for these sorts of skill sets and
institutional know how in the nascent
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, it was a bit of a no
brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really came into the cannabis
industry aiming to create institutional
[SPEAKER_01]: benchmarks and standards both from the
point of view of professional services and
[SPEAKER_01]: execution, but also this ESG side and
managing environmental social governance
[SPEAKER_01]: variables throughout expanding this
nascent industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you maybe give everybody an
explanation of what is regenerator of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think of regeneration,
it's creating growth from the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view of decay or waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a way, the cannabis industry as a
whole is regenerative, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: After nearly a century of prohibition,
of decay, of waste, of incarceration,
[SPEAKER_01]: of vulnerable asset classes, we now have
the opportunity to create value,
[SPEAKER_01]: to create jobs, to create opportunity out
of the industry that stems from this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes from the medical cannabis
industry to the wellness and recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use cannabis industry and to the
industrial applications of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa L plant or the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, we see it as a very holistic
concept of regenerating communities,
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerating economic impact, regenerating
agriculture and phytoremediation and
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon sequestration of ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we believe there's an enormous
potential of this plant as a whole to
[SPEAKER_01]: create new generative industries in a
place where we've had either obsolescence,
[SPEAKER_01]: non-existent or decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first topic I wanted to talk about
was sustainability in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody what are the
top two, let's say the top two tier things
[SPEAKER_00]: that any cannabis company, let's say with
indoor and outdoor should be an automatic
[SPEAKER_00]: part of their business principles to be
able to ensure that they're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable product?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have to actually take a step
back prior to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're creating a plan for your
cannabis value chain, whether you plan to
[SPEAKER_01]: be vertical or you plan to be integrated
into one part of the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: location is the primary variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that in the next decade,
most of the world's cannabis will be
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated in the Sun Belt or the Global
South, whatever name we want to ascribe to
[SPEAKER_01]: these regions, but cost effective regions
with abundant natural resources is where
[SPEAKER_01]: we believe cannabis should be cultivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the point of view of even before
we understand the impact of one particular
[SPEAKER_01]: style of cultivation versus another,
we need to give a very strong weighting to
[SPEAKER_01]: putting your business in the right place
to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, I would say understanding the
impact of energy on your cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: practice and your overall sustainability
profile is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you put your cultivation assets in a
place with abundant natural resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing them appropriately with climate
controlled advanced greenhouses that take
[SPEAKER_01]: into account as much sun spectrum as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those sorts of variables are probably the
top on everyone's list when setting up a
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the medical cannabis
side of the industry, I'm correct in
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that all has to be grown indoor
under strict conditions with HVAC systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and ECS systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not entirely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are correct that medical cannabis
has to be grown under GACP environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good agriculture and collection
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's no explicit note of what
that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are multiple medical herbs that
are grown under GACP that are grown
[SPEAKER_01]: completely outside in the elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of medical cannabis is either
grown indoors, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: in greenhouses, either Dutch venlo style,
fully climate control advanced greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: or hybrid greenhouses, which are more like
hoop houses with ventilation and basic
[SPEAKER_01]: climate control, but without the advanced
24 seven monitoring that we have in venlo
[SPEAKER_01]: style greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the supply on the
current market, let's say in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority is indoors, but that's only a
function of the market itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when 26% of the German market happens
to come from the Netherlands and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands has one company that has a
monopoly on medical cannabis and they grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's 26% of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilray and canopy growth take another big
part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we're naturally accustomed to
thinking that cannabis can only be grown
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, GACP practices don't have
that level of granularity and control.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you see a future basically where
cultivation is going to be around the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator and that European countries will
be able to ship this product in,
[SPEAKER_00]: repackage it in certain territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then then transport it logistically to
the dispensaries and pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that that sort of hub and
spoke model is the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not to say that on continental
Europe, we don't have low cost,
[SPEAKER_01]: energy abundant cultivation centers
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the Balkan areas of northern
Macedonia, northern Greece, Bulgaria,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes online, Romania to to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those areas around the Black Sea are
very well conducive to producing high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality cannabis with minimal natural
resources and a cost of labor that's
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly lower than the majority of
Western or northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know of any facilities that are
basically be able to have designed a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that's completely off the grid
where the water irrigation through
[SPEAKER_00]: recycled, it's got solar panels for
electricity or are we still a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years away from that dream?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's I I love that question
because that is the warrior's aim.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the proof of concept to create
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't visited a facility like that
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few clients that have the solar
panels installed that do rainwater
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rainwater collection is
supplementing wells and things of that
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still on a supplementary basis
versus completely off off the grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think even off the grid,
it would be challenging to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: confluence of fully off the grid energy
and water sufficient enough for
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm I there's a couple of regions where
I could see that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia is a place that that I think
could could potentially be close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we hear a lot of news out of
Colombia with the supposedly going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply side of the European industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a realistic expectation or are
there new territories that we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: basically isolated and highlighted yet
that are going to be able to surpass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the climate in Colombia,
like we've been told, the perfect climate
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to grow, dry and do all the
things with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I I don't think Colombia
is a perfect climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has very high humidity and you
need a particular set of genetics to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do well in a climate like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the pure kind of cannabis
connoisseur, it takes a certain terroir,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is largely found similar to wine
growing regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Catalonia and the Alpujar Mountains in
Spain have very good quality for for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis, obviously in northern
California, southern Oregon as as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colombia may not be perfect from the
point of view of purely cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the amount of sunlight they have,
the amount of rain they have, that
[SPEAKER_01]: combination, that balance allows you to
create the matrix of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's this key.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key takeaway that we wish all of our
clients to take away is it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: checklist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going going through any sort of
this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shape up, level up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a matrix and adjusting this
matrix to your budget, to your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, to your specific needs of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're always after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from that point of view, Colombia does
have something special, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's any more special than a place like
Thailand, which is rapidly opening up and
[SPEAKER_01]: ramping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more and more African countries,
both northern African and sub-Saharan,
[SPEAKER_01]: are going online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think there will be a shortage
of supply in the next decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't point to any one country in
particular to be the future of European
[SPEAKER_01]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so last topic before I let you go is
cannabis and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to energy use and
consumption in cannabis, what is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the next big landmark in terms of being
able to decrease that output?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ag tech inventions or is it
innovations with current methodologies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are already in use?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's in my opinion, it's the
latter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to start treating cannabis as any
other pharmaceutical or agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: commodity and not as a stale worth of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we're so accustomed to
growing cannabis indoors is because we had
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to grow it in basements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And addicts and abandoned buildings and
national forests, right under the cover of
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness and tents and closed loop
irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being here in the Netherlands,
and that's the main reason why De Warrior
[SPEAKER_01]: chose to be headquartered in the
Netherlands to be at the center of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that growing cannabis as an
agricultural commodity in Dutch venlo
[SPEAKER_01]: climate controlled greenhouses
significantly reduces the energy
[SPEAKER_01]: expenditure on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main driver of energy expenditure is
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you shift away from fully indoor
or even worse, vertical, where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: two tiers or three tiers of lighting in
the same space, you start to reduce that
[SPEAKER_01]: overall impact quite significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even putting a cultivation center
that's greenhouse based here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands on the 52nd parallel would
largely reduce the energy expenditure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would basically be equivalent on
an apples to apples basis of using about
[SPEAKER_01]: one quarter of the total energy to having
the same size canopy, but fully indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question before I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it you're looking forward to most
over the next 12 to 24 months in,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, the European cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we got to be optimistic or are
Germany going to fall at the hurdle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you see the Spanish medical market that
comes online at the end of December being
[SPEAKER_00]: a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you're most looking
forward to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having been incorporated in Europe
now and here in the Netherlands since
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018, we've done most of our work in the
medical sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're excited to see what the
adult use tipping point is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned Germany, and we're
certainly excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're looking at 12 to 18 month
horizons, I have to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: nationalistic here and mention the
Geslotenketten Dutch closed loop
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a good feeling that 2023 is
going to be the year of opening up of
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may see the first full vertical
integration, fully taxed, fully legal of
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational cannabis here in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the licenses that are vying for this
right have been in the running since 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of consolidation,
a lot of changes and switches and pivots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we feel really good about the cohort
that's now settled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think the first sale of legal adult
use product is going to be in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that sounds very exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get to touch base in
about 12 to 18 months and see how far
[SPEAKER_00]: things have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody who wants to know more about
regenerative growth and all things
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability, I highly recommend you
check out the Warrior website.
