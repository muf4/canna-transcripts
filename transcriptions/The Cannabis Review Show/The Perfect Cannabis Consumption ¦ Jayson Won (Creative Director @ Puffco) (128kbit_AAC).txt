[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Jason Wan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the creative director of Pufco and in
a past life a multi-talented world
[SPEAKER_01]: renowned musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delighted to be talking to you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pufco are a very exciting company that
I've been reading up on a lot and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at the forefront of everything
that's going on there at the new creative
[SPEAKER_01]: sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of how you got into the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: from music into cannabis and your position
at Pufco at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started out my life journey as a
drummer in a rock band in the 80s here in
[SPEAKER_00]: LA, which was at the time the Mecca of
music, especially that genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent my teen and early 20s playing
in bands, going on tour, doing the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: musician life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after my 20s, I got married and
realized that I couldn't no longer be on
[SPEAKER_00]: the road and live a lifestyle of a
musician and be married.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to give up music and focus on
starting a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing so, I had to find a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only job that I could find was as
basically a janitor at an industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: design company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no high school diploma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a high school dropout, just a
musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't qualified for anything other
than a janitorial job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the job and just worked my way
up the ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, I got to work at a
broadcast design company and started just
[SPEAKER_00]: learning my trade and learning how to
design and doing graphics for television
[SPEAKER_00]: networks and did a couple of high profile
projects like the Super Bowl Open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the 1996 Olympics for NBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were two huge high profile jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, just my design career took
off and I was able to start my own
[SPEAKER_00]: creative agency that got acquired by a
publicly traded company in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just freelancing around town and
heard about this opportunity at Puffco and
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to see if I could meet with them
and speak to them about the role was to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the head of creative and build a creative
department at Puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of hiring an ad agency to do
all the creative and marketing work,
[SPEAKER_00]: build a department to be able to do that
in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of how I ended up at
Puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty exciting story there for the first
half of your life so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure Roger founded the company in
2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are on the way to doing 100
billion turnover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pretty impressive story so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to admit the design of the
products are pretty amazing and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the new accessories for the
line for the viewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the two different product
ranges that Puffco do have for consumers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently we have we last year for an
April Fool's kind of a campaign or an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, we released a product called Budsy,
which is the first non-electronic device
[SPEAKER_00]: that we put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a water bottle,
a bong disguised as a water bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like an April Fool's joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought it was a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't think it was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we released it April 1st last year and
it was a huge success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our products basically we focus on
trying to provide the most enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is to us a medicine or a gift
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just want to create a technology to
provide the most intuitive and enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavorful experience with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the Puffco mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of brings me onto the first
topic I want to highlight is Puffco being
[SPEAKER_01]: the most awarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the flavorful experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the innovation with the technology
that's done in-house?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the number one factor
that makes Puffco the number one brand at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a time we spend in the
thoughts we put into every little detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously in my career, before joining
Puffco, I did get to work with Steve Jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: over at Apple for about seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was about the time when he got back
to Apple after he was let go and he came
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reminds me a lot, Puffco reminds me
a lot of the spirit that Apple had when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was working there with Steve and the rest
of the Apple team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attention to detail, making sure that
everything is there for a reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that all the features all the
things that are on any electronic device
[SPEAKER_00]: is intuitive and it's meaningful and it's
well thought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Puffco as a brand and as a
company, yes, we're a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we want to make profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think our main goal isn't to turn a
profit or to make as much money as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, squeeze every dollar out of our
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goal is to provide a very
meaningful and enjoyable experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: put all our energies and thoughts into
making that as thoughtful as possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in return makes up for a
successful brand because the mission is
[SPEAKER_00]: just like if you have a career goal and
your goal is only to make money,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all you're going to do and focus
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you learn your craft and do your
job really, really well and put a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought and effort into what you're
putting your energy towards, the money
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes a side effect of the great work
that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's kind of what Puffco's
mission is, is to always chase innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: and not chase money and, you know,
profits and all the other great things
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen by creating a wonderful
product and bring it into the marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, the profits and the success,
financial success is all a byproduct of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis industry is a unique
industry when you look at it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer's point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a customer for four to five
decades if you've got a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good products are really the ones
that kind of rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a case of lowest market price
sales in this industry at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas let's say chocolate or drinks
industry or whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis consumers are well
educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what's going into their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would sooner spend that a little bit
extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can provide the perfect design,
which you guys have done, which I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's you've built the perfect,
the perfect products, but then you seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: have stripped them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that wasn't required gets taken
out immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about just business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about building and making sure every
component in the device has a use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when we do upgrade versions or we
do our limited editions, our product
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, we don't just put things out for
the sake of putting it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really put a lot of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an amazing product team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an amazing quality control team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an amazing customer service team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really takes an entire infrastructure,
an entire team of people to make a
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a successful brand because there's
so many touch points with the consumer and
[SPEAKER_00]: so many things that need to be carefully
thought out and really work through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think our biggest asset is that we
do have a very passionate and loyal
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give us their feedback and they
let us know what they'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let us know what they don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for us as a brand or as a
company to have a dialogue with our
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and not just have a monologue,
I think is a very huge kind of advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been lovely and interesting looking
from Ireland at the North American scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start to see now the top companies
in each sector coming to the fore,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pufco in your territory, Cannes in the
beverages industry, Cookies in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensers industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's just going to become
more and more prevalent with M&A's over
[SPEAKER_01]: the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to be an exciting,
let's say, next five, 10 years ahead for
[SPEAKER_01]: what could be huge potential for Pufco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think technology evolves really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the beautiful things about
Pufco and why I enjoy working here so much
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we're a purpose driven brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a brand that's just purposefully
strictly capitalistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a brand that care about social
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a brand that cares about human
equality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We care about all of the people that the
shoulders of the giants that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: standing on, people that had had to serve
25, 30 year sentences in jail to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to, for us to enjoy the legalization that
we have currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the things that we do, we do it
with purpose, just like with our devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're very aware of social causes
and things that we feel passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel passionate about along with
our community so that we're not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice on our own, but we're able to hand
our megaphone or share our platform with
[SPEAKER_00]: those voices that need to be heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think companies like yourselves need
to lead from the front because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: just all about capital gains and returns
of this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're much more vested in the industry
work and as a whole and delivering quality
[SPEAKER_01]: products to people than just having a
couple of commas in a bank account at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, the cannabis
industry is born out of activism,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a demonized plant medicine that got
a bad PR rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's starting to be
normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to, we have to be at the
forefront of normalizing this plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: really sharing the benefits of this plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me personally, I have a huge sleeping
disorder for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doctors prescribed me every
sleeping pill, every, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a volume and any Xanax, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been prescribed it to try to put me
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does put you to sleep, but you know,
you're, the rest of your day is ruined
[SPEAKER_00]: after you wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's such a powerful tranquilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got introduced to cannabis and
CBD, it changed my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly added value to my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got off of these poisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only thing I used to,
to go to sleep and relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's been a huge asset to,
to my wellbeing in so many different ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: mentally, physically, I feel so much
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really provided me a, a,
a enjoyable kind of alternative to the
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prescription drugs that the doctors were
prescribing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what one of the topics I was going
to go with you is from tranquilizers to
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't know about your journey
going from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's great to highlight to
everybody that you don't need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming a lot of tablets to get a good
night's sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of different methods
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a little bit of research on it,
it's going to bring me on to the last
[SPEAKER_01]: topic, the perfect cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the perfect way to
consume cannabis and all the little
[SPEAKER_01]: variables that would go with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to me personally, I think that
there is no wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what you prefer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still enjoy every, you know,
I enjoy a joint, you know, sharing a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy taking edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy vaping, concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy every process of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite way is, you know, not only
because I've worked at Puffco,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the Peak Pro is my favorite way to
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so simple, clean, easy,
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I do it at a, I don't do it
to like chase, you know, clouds or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it to really enjoy the flavor of the
plant and to really enjoy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality hash and to relax me and go
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's no wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to find something that
works for you, whether it's edibles or
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures or, you know, the good old
flower or concentrates, just find
[SPEAKER_00]: something that works for you and then
explore and experiment with other ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you can find something that even
suits your lifestyle or your needs better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're an extremely busy man,
so I'm not going to take up too much more
[SPEAKER_01]: of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, the website for Puffco is
obviously below.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you have already been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't, you should go check out
their Concentrate pens and their portable
[SPEAKER_01]: water pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're absolutely top notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason, I can't thank you enough for coming
on the show and hope we get to chat again
[SPEAKER_01]: in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check in the next episode.
See you next week.
Bye.
