[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Dr. Benjamin Kaplan, who's the founder
[SPEAKER_00]: and chief medical officer at CED Clinic
and CED Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Dr. Kaplan?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man with a very busy
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of a number of entrepreneurial
ventures and medical ventures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got a huge area of expertise in
both, and I'm going to touch on those
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, can we start with your book
that you've recently brought out called
[SPEAKER_00]: The Doctor Approved Cannabis Handbook?
[SPEAKER_00]: The link will be in all the viewing and
listening positions that you're watching
[SPEAKER_00]: this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe tell everybody what
motivated you to write this book?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen the common narrative
that cannabis is poorly understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: The acceptance of cannabis by the medical
sort of community is languishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The substance, of course, is stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the power of evidence and
research and advocacy is bringing real
[SPEAKER_01]: patients real relief, and it's just kind
of lost on the medical establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the right thing to do to
collect the patient's care, evidence that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, the research that I'm doing,
and to share it with the public in
[SPEAKER_01]: language that everybody can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you have a huge wealth of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the statistics I was coming across
that over 16,000 patients you've dealt
[SPEAKER_00]: with, there must be a huge data now that
you've built up a huge database.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the methodology for going
about gaining the new information for the
[SPEAKER_00]: book, was there a specific way you went
about doing this, or was it taken from
[SPEAKER_00]: data you'd already accumulated?
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical establishment is just
completely left in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think doctors are not taught about
medical cannabis in med school.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not understanding the therapeutic
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were painting a picture,
there's a gigantic hole in the middle,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is literally the system which has
the most prolific signaling in the human
[SPEAKER_01]: body, and that's the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you imagine the depth of emptiness in
the literature that we're learning about,
[SPEAKER_01]: the studies that we're conducting,
the treatments that we're providing,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, patients are missing one of the
systems which causes joy in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: To have that as a gigantic missing piece
in medical care is ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became a mission on its own,
once I was discovering this, to share it
[SPEAKER_01]: with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something we shouldn't be without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listeners and viewers might not know,
but in the last 100 years, it's really the
[SPEAKER_01]: only time in human history where cannabis
was present front and center.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have archaeological evidence going back
12,000 years that this was part of ancient
[SPEAKER_01]: human history, and certainly throughout
the rest of history, just until the early
[SPEAKER_01]: 20th century, this hasn't been part of
normal dialogue, but it's a human plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The book covers 16 different chapters with
a host and multitude of elements that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be researched and looked at well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the future of the
medicine side of things, obviously the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor targeting drugs and formulations
that are going to be able to discover it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the big, huge market that's off in
the future that most cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_00]: will get into, or do you think that's
going to be dominated by pharma?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The perception of cannabis has often been
clouded with myths and misconceptions and
[SPEAKER_01]: skepticism, but as more research has
emerged, it's clear that the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits aren't just hearsay, that people
are really finding benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're rooted in rigorous science and
evidence, and that's the underpinnings of
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional pharma world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ground pharmaceuticals in evidence,
in studies, in clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has just been going through its
own natural clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have consumed it really forever,
against all odds and against whatever laws
[SPEAKER_01]: told them they couldn't, and people have
found benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are countries where it's
common to cook soup and to drink tea with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, and everywhere else people just
did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it felt good, it felt right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think slowly the mainstream
establishment is catching up with what
[SPEAKER_01]: people have already known.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study that was published by the
Journal of the American Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Association that's in your book that
noticed the increase in 65 and overage
[SPEAKER_00]: group in using cannabis, surely that's the
secret untapped market that most people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't really focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody thinks trying to get the
modern user over into the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not going to be via smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be via vaping,
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really getting dosed,
and emulsion technologies at the scale
[SPEAKER_00]: where they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surely that 65 and over who can have a
pill for a multitude of different ailments
[SPEAKER_00]: are that secret untapped audience that
people should be focusing their own deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not so secretive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicare budget and Medicaid is close to
30 billion, and the government,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in the US, but really other
governments as well, are spending so much
[SPEAKER_01]: money to take care of our most sensitive
populations, these older adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we get older, the ailments of aging
catch up with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The joints become painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The days become longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things, surprise,
surprise, are tied to the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're not looking and learning
about the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're not treating that, we're just
treating half of the people we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a paradigm without a core mission,
without a core central piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book has, of course, clear chapters
dedicated to ailments of aging,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the least of which is cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most of us get cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 40% of people get cancer as we get
older.
[SPEAKER_01]: But creating an end of life plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, imagine we live in a world now
where dying is this weird time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us, you know, don't have a luxury
of dying with dignity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either costly or disconnected from
our families when we're getting sick and
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hospitals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a way to incorporate
cannabinoid therapies and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of moods, of memory,
of feeling joy, which can make aging less
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the population based medicine
moving towards a more individualistic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach or do you still think it seems to
be a one size fits all at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, traditional medicine, it's one size
fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have depression, we got this array of
pills to treat you with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even one day from the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you might have a beautiful day
or see a beautiful movie and feel
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you be taking the same medicine,
which amplifies things as if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: changing at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: That paradigm doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, you know, we we've sort
of fallen in love with this genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine where Oh, my gosh, if we only had
your map, we would understand exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not true either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a our map changes, you know,
genes are one thing, but the way they're
[SPEAKER_01]: read is another, depending on your
environment, depending on the foods you
[SPEAKER_01]: eat, the amount you sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your manifestation of the code is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not so cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all wish there was a clear
answer that worked for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe because it would be simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've found treating patients
individually is that it's it's better for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to feel like they don't have
a voice in their own care.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people are empowered with care that
matches their needs, their days,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it changes with life, we're happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't want to be in this sort
of silo, you know, this pigeonhole of who
[SPEAKER_01]: I am and who I should be and what I should
feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people want flexibility and
freedom to be different one day from the
[SPEAKER_01]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move now on to your
entrepreneurial success that you've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the CED clinic's mission?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed clinic is pronounced like seed,
like the seed of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed mission is a private medical
practice that specializes in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Eocare, that's guiding patients with
HIPAA compliant digital health care
[SPEAKER_01]: services for cannabinoid based treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of the the the scaling of
medical care.
[SPEAKER_01]: A doctor like me can see one patient at a
time and I can get to know them and care
[SPEAKER_01]: about them and evolve with them as their
therapeutic journey changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do we scale someone like me when
medical school is not teaching cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors are not really plugged in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need a digital solution for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Eocare is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're reaching out to broad audiences,
learning about who they are, what they
[SPEAKER_01]: need, and then giving them individualized
care through a digital platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the successful acquisition you had of
Solo Sciences, do you maybe want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: people a little bit of a story on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to hear a success story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I'm privileged to have that
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Solo was a company trying to give
transparency into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, around 2019, we had this vapor
crisis where people were consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and things things were happening
that we didn't understand that were bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that was a little bit confusing
tobacco smoke with cannabis smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also confusing, licensed,
regulated dispensary products with crud
[SPEAKER_01]: that was made on the street by people that
didn't know how to make their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've since learned that street products
are not safe and dispensary products are
[SPEAKER_01]: generally safe if they're regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during that time, it was important for
the public to have transparency and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what Solo was all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your work at Green Access Capital,
are they one of the top firms when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to investment in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Green Access Capital is a unique fund
that's raising money from interested and
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's led by a team of really the
industry's experts in understanding how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can succeed from a business
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look at new startup companies,
ones that have started to generate money,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe not enough and need to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that success is shared with the
business community of investors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: I serve as an advisor, just helping them
understand which companies have their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff together and which companies maybe
need more work or need a later look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are your thoughts currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the medical side of the
industry just getting pushed to the side
[SPEAKER_00]: there, or is it thriving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what are your viewpoints on that
territory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think New York is struggling with
the same struggles that everybody else is
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shift in perspective that leads
to a rewriting of our understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think it's only for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people think it's only for fooling
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, anybody who consumes cannabis
finds it therapeutic, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: adolescent feeling uncomfortable at a
party and just wants to feel relaxed or a
[SPEAKER_01]: grown up who's at the end of a day wants
to unwind and just de-stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all therapeutic reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unfortunate thing is that people can
sell products for a low cost, attract a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational audience that just wants to
fool around and maybe doesn't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, the medical industry
gets washed over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that is because there aren't
medical leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical establishment has just
completely lost its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, they're not going to fight
for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's part of what I'm doing with the
Doctor Approved Cannabis Handbook is
[SPEAKER_01]: arming the public with what I've learned
with the knowledge to understand the value
[SPEAKER_01]: here, how medical cannabis can be applied
to almost everybody in almost every
[SPEAKER_01]: illness, whether it's treating the illness
at its foundation or just managing the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms of discomfort.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something in the cannabis plant
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to say the best medical
cannabis companies have still not been
[SPEAKER_00]: created yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that the current crop of
companies have copped onto the blends and
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations of these specific molecules
are going to be able to be an advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: route for success for a lot of companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we haven't scratched the surface
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people out there, including
clinicians, think CBD and THC is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two drops in a gigantic bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant produces hundreds, probably
thousands of different compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: each of which has medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look in the published literature,
you can pick off each of those individual
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules and find research on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can understand that, oh, my gosh,
alpha pining.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm walking in the forest and that
that pine smell, oh, I feel like I can
[SPEAKER_01]: breathe better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: From a pulmonologist perspective,
a lung doctor, we see that actually people
[SPEAKER_01]: can breathe a little bit more easily when
they're exposed to alpha pining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of, as I said, a thousand
different compounds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much in this natural pharmacy
that we have yet to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think traditional pathways, the
pharmaceutical industry is not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use cannabis in the same way that
they're used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to have to develop new
tools, new understandings, a more natural
[SPEAKER_01]: view of how we can use nature in medicine,
which I think is really refreshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to sort of turn a new leaf here on
how we care for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fermentation engineering seems to be one
of the key areas that could hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: propel access to these rare molecules and
allow for the blends, whether that seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be come to fruition, we shall see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so what you're referring to are sort
of different ways to surface these active
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way is to grow a plant and throw it to
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic plants grow wildly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way you can do it is to
consolidate lots of plants and pick off
[SPEAKER_01]: the parts you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way actually is to grow other
vectors, like yeast or like some bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all areas of exploration to see
what people want, what people will buy and
[SPEAKER_01]: what actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole industry dawning here
that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing before I let you go,
if there was one medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: conference in America that you think
somebody should attend, what would be your
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we start to see with the conferences,
there's more focus on the after parties
[SPEAKER_00]: than there is on the content of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't want to be a Debbie
Downer, but I found conferences to largely
[SPEAKER_01]: be commercial ventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of lectures that are
wonderful and it's nice to hear learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's often regulators and lawyers and
hopefully some doctors talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the conferences themselves are really
an opportunity for vendors to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a viewer, as an attendee,
you're kind of attending this commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: fest where people want your number,
want to contact you and want you to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't have much value to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to speak at some, but I quickly
leave so I don't have to deal with the
[SPEAKER_01]: crowds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think at the current state of
conferences, I usually tell people to
[SPEAKER_01]: steer clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good bit of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to learn more,
I highly recommend checking out Benjamin's
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's below and the link to buy the book
The Doctor Approved Cannabis Handbook will
[SPEAKER_00]: be on YouTube, Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have easy access to be able to get
a copy up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, Benjamin, thank you very much
for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
