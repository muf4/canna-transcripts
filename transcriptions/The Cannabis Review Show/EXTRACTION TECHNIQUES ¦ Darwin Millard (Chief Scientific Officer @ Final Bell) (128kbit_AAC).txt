[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Darwin Miller, who's the Chief
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientific Officer at Final Bill and also
an entrepreneur and inventor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Darwin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing very well, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic mate, as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking time out of
your busy day to chat with us and help
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully educate the audience on a couple
of different topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick overview of how you ended up the CSL
[SPEAKER_00]: at Final Bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've been in the industry a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been in industry 17 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, you know, mechanical engineer out
of college, it could have been design
[SPEAKER_01]: slurry pumps for the fracking industry or
join the cannabis industry 17 years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to, with my hands-on
experience and kind of navigating the
[SPEAKER_01]: market, teamed up with an amazing group
here at Final Bill and have an opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the Chief Science Officer and help
with our scientific and process
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiencies and all sorts of different
research and development efforts that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final Bill look like a very impressive
company and I can see them changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape for a lot of the smaller brands
over the next coming years and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's exciting to be part of such a great
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing team and I feel super
fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's just jump into this topic
straight away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I wanted to talk about,
and you're pretty an expert on this topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: is extraction techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe explain over here in Ireland
at the moment, you're only allowed to use
[SPEAKER_00]: a coal pressed isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are no super critical,
there are no CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legality is it has to be a coal
pressed isolate and has to be done on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of what are the best techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the most cost effective and what's
the most popular one you see?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess that's an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously, depending on what
type of end product you're looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: make, maybe you might choose a different
extraction method or technique based on
[SPEAKER_01]: that end goal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there might be multiple different ways
to get to say a crude initial extract and
[SPEAKER_01]: then a few different ways to refine that,
but maybe only a couple of say techniques
[SPEAKER_01]: for isolating and purifying individual
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on that marketplace you're
in, if you're not allowed to utilize
[SPEAKER_01]: certain techniques, then you're kind of
prohibited from being able to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: there and you might have to import those
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see as being, what's the best
form of extraction if you were to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it a completely different process for,
let's say, an edible extraction than it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be for a cartridge extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, I'm as a process trained
design engineer and kind of trying to be
[SPEAKER_01]: agnostic about extraction techniques,
don't have one method over another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's particularly good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, CO2, ethanol extraction,
hydrocarbon, these all work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for depending on what your end goal
is, what you're trying to make,
[SPEAKER_01]: some may be more or less efficient based
on, you know, whether you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a purified isolate or a distillate,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so when in terms to the extraction
techniques, there isn't a metric,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, per gram per liter extracted
that people use in the industry to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to use a specific, OK, this is the
technique we're going to use because it
[SPEAKER_00]: delivers us A, B and C of our return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, that's a great question,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yield is obviously really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on whether that's weight in
to weight out or how much solvent you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using and other things, there's lots of
different ways to measure efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think scale of operation is one of
the most important kind of depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: where you are at.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to get a quick and dirty,
you know, extraction out and then clean
[SPEAKER_01]: that up with distillation, for instance,
ethanol really is a very cost effective
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, no reason to use, you know,
something like a very expensive CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: extractor again, for instance,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just trying to make crude that
you're going to clean up with distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be supercritical extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the that makes it so super?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So supercritical fluid extraction is you
take CO2 and, you know, there are there's
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid, there's solid and there's gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, supercritical is another phase of
matter where you actually have the
[SPEAKER_01]: properties of a gas and a liquid so you
can extract more efficiently when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in those those particular phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the two process that get the end
product, the extraction and the
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation, can you do a bad
distillation and have a good extraction or
[SPEAKER_00]: can you do a bad extraction and have a
good distillation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you both need to be delivering
standards that are required?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you can certainly have bad
distillation and bad extractions,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could clean up a bad extraction
with good distillation and you could ruin
[SPEAKER_01]: a good extract with a bad distillation
process, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dialing in your problem, your
parameters, you know, vacuum depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, et cetera, that helps you
achieve your efficient extraction and or
[SPEAKER_01]: distillation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to jump on to the next
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I've kind of been
curious and I think you're the most expert
[SPEAKER_00]: guest that I've had on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to answer this for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, pharmacological properties,
terpenes versus terpenoids versus
[SPEAKER_00]: carameroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we know terpenes are basically just a
simple carbonated structure and terpenoids
[SPEAKER_00]: have oxygen in that exact same structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to extract a product,
which one would you be advising somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: to put into a specific, let's say an oil
based product or are they all a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination or going to be required to
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the desired effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually not the best to answer
pharmacological property questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do know that in regards to classes
of molecules, terpenes and terpenoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids are all terpenoid phenolic
secondary metabolites and are all coming
[SPEAKER_01]: together instead of in your typical
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going for full spectrum or a
broad spectrum extract, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these are coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make up that flavor profile,
that smell profile, everything that is
[SPEAKER_01]: really, whether it's a solventless extract
or a hydrocarbon based extract or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes that profile so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And broad spectrum versus full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an argument to be had here or is
a known conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear somebody who is it's not real
unless it's full spectrum and other people
[SPEAKER_00]: battle the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your expert opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's semantics, whether it's
full or broad spectrum, I guess a great
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific approach to that is how can you
truly be full if you are leaving behind
[SPEAKER_01]: cellulose or chlorophyll, other things
that might not be necessarily of interest
[SPEAKER_01]: in your extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's full or broad,
I think what the market is kind of defined
[SPEAKER_01]: that as is does it have trace amounts of
THC in it or no THC at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of where that has fallen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full spectrum is a non-starter for
conversation because it isn't actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain elements left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a wealth of information to
come out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I wanted to talk about
international affairs and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we hear a lot of talk about Europe is
going to be a bigger market than North
[SPEAKER_00]: America and a lot of the companies in
Canada and America talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have X amount of market
share when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the language that you see
happening in the international affairs of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, how realistic do you think
American brands are going to be over in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe selling to a recreational market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how quickly do you think actually
probably the Senate is going to okay full
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation in America first off?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in regards to adult use products being
manufactured in, say, the States,
[SPEAKER_01]: being shipped and sold in Europe,
I don't think that is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Europe is more than capable of
being able to produce its own adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, the more novel foods,
dietary supplements, and true
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals, that's where you might
see more global commodity manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: hubs coming up, whether that might be in
India or South Africa or North America or
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever it might.
[SPEAKER_01]: The climatic region makes it more
efficient to produce these raw materials
[SPEAKER_01]: that allow you to produce large bulk
ingredients for whether that's the food
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain, which obviously is quite
demanding on raw ingredients or
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's an opportunity for,
say, US manufacturers who are advantageous
[SPEAKER_01]: about conforming to European quality
control practices to be able to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: either raw ingredients or finished goods
that they can manufacture legally in the
[SPEAKER_01]: States but, say, can't sell legally
nationally and can take advantage of the
[SPEAKER_01]: say the European Union or the UK's
marketplace that allows for novel foods
[SPEAKER_01]: with CBD in them, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and what are your thoughts now?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of talk, but we've already
talked to Ilan Sobel from Bio-Harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences and from Creon Green,
it's Shusi Sarkar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on the ability for
bioreactors to be able to create cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: on mass scale with multiple different
yields per year versus a firearm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that being an actual logical
ingredient for people to be using due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the price point they're going to be able
to compete with and the amount of scale
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be able to deliver?
[SPEAKER_01]: Precision fermentation is an amazing
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to address your other question I
forgot, within the United States for
[SPEAKER_01]: legality, where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say still easily three to five years
out before we see it nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But precision fermentation, now that's an
amazing subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we going to see that come into
play in the cannabinoid industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to precision manufacturing
of enzymes and other things we see in
[SPEAKER_01]: food, this is a known thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's commonly done and without it,
we actually wouldn't have yeast cultures
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be available to sell
commercially for breadstarts and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So precision fermentation is definitely
here to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it come into play for the
cannabinoid industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question because it's not
as simple as I just want to make THCV,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to do that you have to map out the
genetic pathway to get from CBGA,
[SPEAKER_01]: the very first cannabinoid, all the way
through the cycle to get to THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not one culture of yeast that's
multiple iterations and life cycles of
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast to get to that one that'll take a
starter from another culture and produce
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have a culture that
produces CBGA first, and then one that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes CBG, and then one that makes THCA,
and then one that makes CBGA, and then one
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, et cetera, et cetera, before you
can really get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'll see is these, the master or
precursor cannabinoid CBG come around
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you kind of look around the
industry, you'll already see that CBG from
[SPEAKER_01]: precision fermentation is currently being
used in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll see THC and CBD come
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in those particular cases
where you have the ability to produce it
[SPEAKER_01]: so easily from plant material,
it might be harder to justify the
[SPEAKER_01]: significant investment in that
infrastructure to precision ferment it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some of these novel cannabinoids
that might be more difficult to do and say
[SPEAKER_01]: that that synthesis pathway might be
easier to genetically imprint,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll start to see that come
around in the next five to 10 years for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you see a lot of those
companies, geranophiles, phosphoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the CBGA are the kind of things that
they're initially having, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain of yeast as their visa is spit
out and can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not a case of that CBGA then just
needs to have enzyme reactions that will
[SPEAKER_00]: turn the CBGA into another cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why the process works,
or is it a whole new strain of engineered
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast, do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is also another engineered strain
of yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do that second stage in the synthesis
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's an exciting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: One has to make the CBGA, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next yeast culture then takes
that CBGA and turns it to CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely an interesting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland has a renowned history already in
this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're going to see,
once it gets perfected, those rare
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids going into applied
pharmaceutical ingredients and going into
[SPEAKER_00]: food and beverage ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's definitely going to be a
future for the European industry for sure.
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking forward to the most
over the next 12 to 24 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen in the industry
that you're most excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a case of, one of the things I'd
love to see is augmented reality being
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced into a cultivation course,
or maybe machine learning being used to
[SPEAKER_00]: find some cannabinoids and some properties
that might not have been already
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea of augmented reality for
training, especially remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's been implemented already
in facility walkthroughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: See your facility before it's built type
of thing, which has been interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, as a member of ASTM
International's technical committee D37 on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, what I see in the next 12 to 24
months is hopefully a significance and use
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign brought on by the committee to
help inform the global community of the
[SPEAKER_01]: existence of our 35 standards and how they
can be used in the impact and benefit to
[SPEAKER_01]: the marketplace and regulatory authorities
that, for instance, have not yet set up
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory programs and might be thinking
about it and to help them ease from
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit to illicit marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to see more and more global
marketplaces come online and facilitate
[SPEAKER_01]: standards to ease access into the
marketplace and hopefully facilitate a
[SPEAKER_01]: more diverse and I guess global community
in regards to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like little pockets at the moment
on a global scale amongst those free
[SPEAKER_00]: market and free trades are open for this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a very,
very exciting place with people like
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself with great inventions who've
already got a foothold in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great talking to you,
Darwin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been exactly what I thought it was,
informative and a great chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to know more about
Darwin, he has his own website,
[SPEAKER_00]: thespockofcannabis.com is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend everybody checking it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you again, Darwin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you so much and live long and
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
