[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join this episode by
David Trailer, who's the Senior Managing
[SPEAKER_00]: Director at Golden Eagle Partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, David?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so are you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's busy these days trying to keep
the lights on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's how many spinning plates are
happening in the industry at the one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you came about to
[SPEAKER_00]: found Golden Eagle Partners and your
position in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my entree into cannabis is not as
interesting as most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I mentioned to you just a few
minutes ago, Owen, that I have a biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: background, operational background,
then got into investment banking in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco and then moved back to Colorado
to do investment banking, doing biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2012, and that's when Colorado and
Washington legalized adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so started looking at the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with my biotech background,
I started looking at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we say cannabis, Owen,
being a biochemist by background,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to us is the genus, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means industrial hemp, molecular
hemp, marijuana, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC plus is THC minus what we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as getting into cannabis in
general, if you looked at it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is a highly regulated sector and
you also look at it's a biological supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get down to it, it's a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all three of those I found to be very
common to biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump straight into M&A
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be complex endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you highlight and isolate deals
that are going to be potentially good for
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Eagle Partners or Golden Eagle and
the partners that you have at the firm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the one thing that well,
there's a lot of things that make Golden
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle Partners unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the one thing that's pretty
exciting, frankly, for us is, as I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned before, Owen, we've been doing
we're the first investment bank in the U
[SPEAKER_01]: .S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to do cannabis, but we've also been doing
it internationally for over seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I don't think anybody touches
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's given us a really broad based
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I did business development,
biotech companies for four and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: years and did deals, non M&A deals with
the likes of AstraZeneca and Pfizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of things,
distinctions right there that make Golden
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle Partners different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're working with a company
looking at strategic transactions,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, a company recently came to
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an industrial hemp company
asking for, you know, looking for M&A to
[SPEAKER_01]: help them with M&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we typically do is go out to the
market for a client like that if we end up
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging with them and looking at a broad
spectrum of strategic options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the worst thing a company can do,
Owen, is if they're looking for M&A to go
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the market and put a for sale sign
out there, because then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: that gets broadcast and they're not going
to get the best deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing also that's about Golden
Eagle Partners is, again, getting back to
[SPEAKER_01]: that business development experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 20 deals were co-development,
cross licensing, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most investment bankers don't have that
type of background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's what we call an incremental
transaction, not M&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we go to the market,
we're looking at co-development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at a whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more options we can provide our
clients, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as far as the M&A does go,
we did actually close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We closed the M&A transaction last
December.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally closed after regulatory approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story behind that is there's two
former clients of ours and we put them
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was two companies here in Colorado
where I'm from, where I'm based right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that I think it's worked
out well so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both companies like each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nice thing is both companies still
like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's very unique because most M&A
and frankly, most M&A and deals done
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in the US and other places,
frankly, Owen have not worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly because the people that were
putting these deals together didn't look
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, okay, what's gonna go wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's gonna go bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's gonna go belly up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's gonna be a problem with this deal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what makes us different too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was doing business development,
67% of our deals were successful
[SPEAKER_01]: monetarily or scientifically or both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we looked at what was gonna go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's just a long explanation on
how we do M&A and why we're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the M&A deals that happened,
I recently sold a company myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of a, from one to 100%,
how much time is wasted with people just
[SPEAKER_00]: kicking the tires of a deal and coming and
sniffing around?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it always the small percentage that
actually end up following through?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's usually a pretty high
percentage, but I think in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's even higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly because I don't think a lot of
people in cannabis understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between across parties,
but even worse is, one of the things we
[SPEAKER_01]: always say, Owen, is the fact that you
hire an investment banker or advisor for
[SPEAKER_01]: two reasons, relationships and expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still draw on information I learned
back in the late 80s doing biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been doing this, as I mentioned,
seven plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had cannabis companies with
operations on six of the seven continents,
[SPEAKER_01]: Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're doing a deal like that and
finding out, we understand and can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: really help our clients really weed out
the weed from the chafe, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: and to cross the metaphor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is a lot of crap in
cannabis, to put it frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one of the things we do well
too, is to try to certainly separate the
[SPEAKER_01]: real players from the non-serious players.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know that, as you mentioned,
it can muddle a transactional process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, especially in cannabis,
the level of C-suite executives don't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to be at the same caliber of a number of
industries across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be in the easier barrier to
entry to get into this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of now trying to sift
through the good from the bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing is, I grew up going to
college in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I invested in Genentech when I was,
I think, in 84, when I was a sophomore in
[SPEAKER_01]: college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you saw a lot of the same things,
frankly, in biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 80s, where you had a lot of,
for example, PhDs coming in and running
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, PhD, anybody knows, PhD is not a good
training for being a CEO, because as CEO,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to build a team and a PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have a PhD, but certainly PhDs
are not meant to be team players.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your little silo, and that's what
you study on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw the same thing in biotech,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you had people jumping into a very
new industry, thinking that things were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be easy, that all these new
bulleted magical bullets like monoclonal
[SPEAKER_01]: antibodies were going to all of a sudden
cure everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that certainly is not what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of, I think, the same
thing you've seen in cannabis around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world is people think, oh, it's going to
solve a lot of problems, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may, but it's not going to happen
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to licensing and code
development agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be valuable strategies for
expanding a reach and the capabilities of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the kind of key elements that you
see have been a good licensing code
[SPEAKER_00]: development agreement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good question, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of them is to have a high
degree of humility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't assume that the deal is always going
to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think that's looking at what's
going to go south, what's not going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: south.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, I think, having a real
good goal on what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a company has a really good technology,
a really good IP, and they need a really
[SPEAKER_01]: well-known company or somebody who has
different expertise than they do,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the one thing, too, that why more
of an incremental approach like that may
[SPEAKER_01]: be a good idea, Owen, is like,
for example, as you know, if an M&A deal
[SPEAKER_01]: is done and it needs to unwind for some
reason, it's much more painful than
[SPEAKER_01]: unwinding a code development or a joint
venture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even better yet, we believe we're the
first group, which I'm pretty sure we
[SPEAKER_01]: were, to do an option-based deal in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I mentioned, but I was
Chief Business Officer at Cerno,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was one of the first three public
companies in cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went public in March 2014,
and I joined them in December 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did an option-based deal a few months
later after that with an LED company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also, we did an option-based deal
with Panacea Life Sciences in the 22nd
[SPEAKER_01]: century back in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: Option-based structures are really
interesting because you can work together
[SPEAKER_01]: in a company, put a deal together where
there is some cross-fertilization,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, but if things turn south or
things change, like they did with Panacea
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 22nd century, the CEO that
promulgated the deal with Panacea ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving a couple months later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new CEO that came in at 22nd century
didn't like the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That deal was much easier to unwind than
if 22nd century would have bought Panacea
[SPEAKER_01]: 51% or 100% of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tech advancements and market
disruptions are pretty common when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the strategies that you employ to
mitigate these and maximize the value for
[SPEAKER_00]: clients that you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the one thing that is good to
mitigate technical risk, and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I harken back to my days in genomics of
the company I was at, and they thought
[SPEAKER_01]: they had the best technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out they really didn't,
or they could have supplemented their
[SPEAKER_01]: technology with other complementary
technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have built maybe a technical
picket fence because one thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody can agree on technology,
it's hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, what we found when we're
working with companies where we're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: deal on technology or what have you that's
prone to disruption, like cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: prone to disruption all the time too with
new geographies coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have new regulations coming online
with the FDA, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the main things that we,
again, getting back to this arrogance and
[SPEAKER_01]: humility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, that's one of the things that I
mentioned in Bloomberg in February 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: right before the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pandemic shut things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest problems in cannabis
has been the fact that there's been too
[SPEAKER_01]: much arrogance and too little humility,
and you can apply that to technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would think you have the best
technology ever, there's a chance maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you do, but if you don't, then what's your
fallback position?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a lot of times,
for example, drug delivery technology in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, everybody says they have the
best drug delivery technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not true, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a tough thing to do, and that's
humility is, I think, the best thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned your biotechnology
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting topics over the
last year or two that I've started to
[SPEAKER_00]: notice is the ability to biosynthesize
molecules and rare molecules and in turn
[SPEAKER_00]: become an ingredient supplier or develop
your own APIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's the future of the
ingredient side of the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: surely because it's so replicable,
it's so safe, and it's more powerful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible, let's say, for a European
politician to be able to swallow them and
[SPEAKER_00]: extract the plant matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, I think, somewhat of a unique
perspective on this, and part of it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that we essentially come from the
biotech side, and so having run from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: come from the bioprocessing side,
and also one thing, just to put it out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, what we're trying to, what we could
call this is alternative production
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So biosynthesis sometimes is not always
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Synthesis depends, you know, a lot of this
is chemical, chemistry alterations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the one perspective we believe is
that, and this is through my experience in
[SPEAKER_01]: bioprocessing, that the method or methods
that we're going to win out are the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that produce the highest quality molecule
or molecules at the lowest cost,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think everybody would agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our thought is it's probably going to
be a common combination of the two,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a matter of fact, we had a panel at
CANMED, which is one of the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: science conferences in Florida a few weeks
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a panel on this exact topic,
Owen, about, you know, is it cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it alternative production methods,
or synthesis, or biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call it, and one of
the things that came out of it is it
[SPEAKER_01]: really depends on the molecule,
too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I suppose you could deliver the
highest tier amount, the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a lower cost overall and
over time be able to deliver a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: product for a lower cost than their
competitors, so it really seems to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: tier amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever has got the six grams per liter or
the seven grams per liter or above that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be the long-term winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and also, though, coming from
bioprocessing, not only is it what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: the titer over here and the tier there,
but, you know, the stepwise synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's again one of the things
that makes us unique as an investment
[SPEAKER_01]: banking group, Owen, is the fact that the
two patents that I got when I was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: recombinant hemoglobin is I came up with
an idea to use carbon monoxide in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process train, and by implementing that,
it turned out that it improved the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: yield of the whole process from 10% to
40%, so we had a 400% increase in the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall yield of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amazing thing is using that
methodology, we also increased the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of the molecule, the end molecule,
so, you know, that almost never happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: bioprocessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything in cannabis, where,
you know, you're increasing the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're increasing the yield,
it's always kind of, you got to do one or
[SPEAKER_01]: the other, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, that's a skill set that I
learned a long time ago, but it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, it's already provided a lot of
benefits for us working in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're up to our 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man,
so I'm going to let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any companies in the space,
if you haven't checked out Gold Eagle
[SPEAKER_00]: Partners yet, the website is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend checking them out and
touching base if you're ever interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: M &A activity or licensing co-development
agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be the leaders when it comes
to North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: David, thank you very much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next, until next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
