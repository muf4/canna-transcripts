[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to another episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined by Matthew
Herald on today's show to talk about some
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matthew, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just thank you so much for
having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following your work on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some great insights you've been
providing for the people on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great to finally chat to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick things off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you just explained to everybody
where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're the marketing director of
Good Fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe how you got to that position and how
you got into the cannabis industry real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's been a short but also long
road at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few years back, I had a major life
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually lost my father in a bicycle
accident and I delved into guardian
[SPEAKER_01]: caretaking for my mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a ton of responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left a career in health and wellness and
got a really close up view of some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stigmas against cannabis within the
traditional and conventional medical
[SPEAKER_01]: spheres.
[SPEAKER_01]: When my mother was misdiagnosed and I
presented cannabis as a solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were trying to come up with diagnoses
like dementia and then Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, it was adverse reactions to
the medications they were putting her on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found it a bit disheartening that
I couldn't have a conversation with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the doctors in charge of her care to
have really something that I saw as a
[SPEAKER_01]: productive exploration for something that
could help her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in this time, a close friend of mine
started to check in on me just to see if I
[SPEAKER_01]: was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was sort of my escape that we would
talk about the new vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: company that he had just been promoted to
director of operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd spend hours getting into the
spreadsheets, talking about what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: problems or challenges that they're trying
to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got more and more interested and he
was definitely nudging me along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I decided to take it
seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I studied cannabis very intensely for
about six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just over two years ago,
I did a week of training where I got to
[SPEAKER_01]: see every single aspect from the
extraction lab laboratory to the cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mother room, the full cultivation
experience to how it's processed,
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmed, cured, packaged, transported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started my very first day
inside a medical dispensary on 420 two
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That quickly led to all sorts of
opportunities, promotion into marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, I've worked with several
companies after staying there about a
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing, okay, that's a pretty great
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick into the first topic of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that you're gonna
be able to shine a lot of light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis becoming a wellness industry,
do you agree or disagree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see much more acquisitions
happening now from the wellness side of
[SPEAKER_00]: business into the cannabis side?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say how it's going to go
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak to that specifically,
but what I can say is that the wellness
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is very, very large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people don't realize that
it's bigger than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also bigger than the global
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at a $4.5 trillion industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beauty alone, which cannabis has barely
begun to touch, though we know some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy of CBD, as well as there's
promising results for other cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: like even THCA in its raw form seems to be
beneficial to the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beauty is a trillion dollar industry
alone, and that's just part of wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at that, we look at the
spa scene, which is considered separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at all of these caretaking
services.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of opportunity for cannabis
to be integrated into those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're at the very, very beginning,
yet my personal opinion and personal
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective comes from the standpoint of
looking at the data for why people consume
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you dig into those, you see that
even if somebody is not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical patient, they may be
self-medicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the very least, their reasons
typically are all surrounding something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is relatable to wellness and the
pursuit of a higher quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, I think it's an exciting one
that most people aren't paying too much
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capital that the wellness industry
does have to be able to enter this space
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be pretty vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do finally push the button,
I think there's going to be a big chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry brought up by the wellness
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic of conversation, and it's
something I think, again, you're an expert
[SPEAKER_00]: at, and most people haven't got a clue
about, the art of marketing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of people are barred from
using social media sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Luke from CAN, an LA-based
microdose drink on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a great campaign where they were
more imitated to what the effects and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle that reflects CAN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a lot of creative campaigns
happening like that, or do you see people
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on their hands and not knowing
really what to do with themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you get a mix of both,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: CAN's a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting you say that,
because CAN recently entered
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also a beverage company at Good
Feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing a lot in the aspect of
celebrating life and wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the essence of what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And across the board, there's certainly a
lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, each state has different regulations,
which is going to make it challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a distinct East Coast versus
West Coast difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, on adult consumption
products, you can offer promotional
[SPEAKER_01]: discounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the East Coast here in Massachusetts,
you cannot offer discounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right away, that shifts your strategy
for marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of people sitting on their hands,
I think you do have people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: confused at what they can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Digital advertising is starting to open up
just in the last year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're going to see a lot more
creativity coming to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've recently seen New York have
legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw Dutchie have their big,
huge billboard on Times Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Weed Maps, if I'm not mistaken,
had another one there the other weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that becoming a lot more
prominent across the states, such as Super
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowl ads and whatnot, where the cannabis
industry is up there with the Pepsi's and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cokes and the Budweiser ads,
in terms of quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis comes from a background very
closely integrated with music,
[SPEAKER_01]: art, and all sorts of...
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the prohibition in the US,
there's a very prominent actor that
[SPEAKER_01]: refused to stop speaking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a very high profile person.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point being that in terms of the
quality of what we're going to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to keep getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more celebrities signing into
the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone from Martha Stewart to Jay-Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to bring that level of
production up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, I can't wait to see the
first real cannabis Super Bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: advertisement in terms of a brand
representing itself, providing something
[SPEAKER_01]: inspirational, the same way that alcohol
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you guys at Good Fields,
how are you finding the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: maneuver within each state?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys have separate state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you guys got distribution
nationwide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it specific states that you guys
have focused on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to know your
distribution method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms, we're in the middle of
launching in Massachusetts and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: already had conversations because the
interest is there of whether or not we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be in other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our focus is going to be similar to what
some other companies have done to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful, which is we're going to hone
in on getting really strong in
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to we are a Massachusetts born
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to focus on connecting
with our local communities, educating them
[SPEAKER_01]: on our product, as well as we want to give
back to the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our company just converted to 100 percent
renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our employees start at twenty
dollars or higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's entry level for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are doing a number of other things
like converting to all plant based
[SPEAKER_01]: materials to set the tone that when we
look at life and wellness, it's more than
[SPEAKER_01]: just you as a person, but feeling good
about all the things that you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that translates back to your own
wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of our strategy, we're trying
to start local with ourselves and the
[SPEAKER_01]: people around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over time, we're going to look at
what are the best ways to go state by
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I can say is it's really important to
spend some time before doing homework,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the at that regulation,
at those regulations, because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be distinctly different in some
very important key points, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, due diligence, I think, is paramount
when it comes to setting up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, regardless of the
territory at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've actually is pretty
impressive is the way you guys do treat
[SPEAKER_00]: your staff and some of the policies you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the great things about the
cannabis industry, there is so many
[SPEAKER_00]: creative people and it breeds a certain
mindset to get into this industry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first place because you have to chase your
own tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no clear pathway to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always great to see companies
investing in their staff and bringing them
[SPEAKER_00]: along on the journey as opposed to kind of
profit, profit, profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the cannabis industry is going to
be a great way to lead in terms of social
[SPEAKER_00]: equity and reinvest in profits into the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I kind of wanted to bring
up to you was it's a bit of a random one
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just interested to know what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had ten thousand dollars as a
startup for marketing, budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the top three things you'd
recommend to any startup?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to go into too much detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give the maybe top three bullet
points of what you think ten grand would
[SPEAKER_00]: get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, for one, starting to,
you know, there are a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't invest in their own brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think doing some research,
spending some of that money into the sweat
[SPEAKER_01]: of really getting out there, whether it's
through digital medium or getting in in
[SPEAKER_01]: person, which has been difficult to
interview people and start testing ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with Good Feels, we went through an
exercise to really learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all these parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason, who's the founder, is a
tremendous person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is his whole family.
[SPEAKER_01]: His wife is, you know, they think very
similarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm on board, because I
think the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think brands can can really hone in on
understanding who they are, what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are they providing for and getting
getting that down to an essence so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's only a few words long.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that homework up front,
it's going to guide the entire marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: plan from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're in the age of content
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to need to have a story,
whether that's investing in the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: film and photograph whatever you're doing
before you launch, whether it's working
[SPEAKER_01]: with creatives to to build out something
that's exciting and entertaining and
[SPEAKER_01]: delightful for people to engage with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the things that I would invest
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would invest in relationships,
also in educating people who are within
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry, forming a relationship with
dispensaries, with retailers, holding in
[SPEAKER_01]: on site trainings as covid starts to shift
back perhaps to a more normal way of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be extremely important and
providing investing in those materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what's something someone can hold and
bring home with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not only going to provide them
value and tell your story, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also to educate them on how to have
the best experience when they consume
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis safety first and always about how
do we how do we make it so it's most
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyable and going to raise up someone's
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that's always very
important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when we exude that as a
company, the people really resonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel that they feel that they're
cared for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a real ingredient
for a successful company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been hugely informative and a
great discussion to have with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody wants to know more about
Goodfeels?
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is there below on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you follow Matthew on
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a daily source of information and
positivity that's well much needed in
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes a shit show of misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been great to chat to you,
Matthew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to chat again before the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got lots more to discuss on a
positive note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it again any time you take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
