[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody, the next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined to this episode
by Mike Goral, who's a partner at Armin
[SPEAKER_01]: Nino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has been a tax professional since
1989, has a significant experience in
[SPEAKER_01]: federal, state and local tax from both a
legal and a financial perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a topic I've wanted to cover for a
short bit of time and no better and
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself to be able to help give us some
guidance on this topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give out the audience
a quick overview in under 30 seconds of
[SPEAKER_01]: how Armanino ended up having a tax
division and how you ended up being ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabis tax group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I started several years ago back in
2015 and I noticed that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was going to go state by state
and it was not going to be federally legal
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite some time and it still is not in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I learned about it and then wrote
the treatise for Thomson Reuters on
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-state cannabis taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm one of the leading experts in
how this industry is taxed across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of things that from a
European perspective, I'd love to find out
[SPEAKER_01]: about the US tax state by state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you're going to be able to
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first and foremost, why are the taxes
so high on a state level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just the government's and the states
don't understand how it should be taxed or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a part of greed thinking the industry
is going to bring in more revenue than it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, unfortunately, the states,
you know, when they determine how to tax
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry, instead of taxing it at a
very low rate, say alcohol or tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: they determine how much revenue do they
want to generate from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they figure out how much legal
cannabis will be sold that will be taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they back into the tax rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, ends up being such a high
rate that many cannabis companies are
[SPEAKER_00]: having trouble keeping their business open
because the taxes are just so high and the
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit market is thriving under these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any state that have gotten it
right so far or is everybody doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact same mistake that their predecessors
have done before them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, unfortunately, the newer states that
are coming onto the market, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as New York and others are making the
same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New York's case, they're taxing it
not on price, but on THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there could be some
manipulation of, you know, the the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: labs to to score something with a lower
THC, because that means that will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower tax in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and so when it comes to the news that
Governor Gavin Newsom of California
[SPEAKER_01]: basically got rid of a cultivation tax,
I think it is and changed excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the big deal with what he did
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And was it a crazy play from the get go?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more riding around at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in California, they structured their
tax system somewhat like a value added tax
[SPEAKER_00]: that's used in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to tax it all along the
way, you know, from cultivation to
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution to manufacturing to finally
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the cultivation level, you know,
that was just the tax again was too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now that it's gone away,
it's a little too little too late kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario for many California cannabis
growers, because the price of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, wholesale cannabis has gone
from, say, two thousand dollars a pound to
[SPEAKER_00]: now less than six hundred dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it costs, you know, many of those
growers about that much to produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and so does it look like New York
seems to be the one that seems to be maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully getting it right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or from your perspective, are they making
the same tax mistakes that the other
[SPEAKER_01]: states are making?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, again, New York decided to use a THC
content as their means of taxing this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry at the retail level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I think that there's
just this race to higher and higher THC
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, you know, to come up with a
product that has the highest THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, I think, you know,
once you get to a certain point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need more THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, New York wants to tax it
based on a THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that's going to be a
solution either, because the price of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you know, when you buy it
legally is going to be so high compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there hasn't been enough enforcement
of illegal operators that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's still going to be a problem
there in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to setting the actual
percentage of taxes, is that down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: governor's office?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it down to the taxation like the IRS?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it down to who exactly decides,
right, it's going to be 15 percent or 12
[SPEAKER_01]: percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it varies, you know, depending on the
different, you know, governments and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is done by a committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's done at the legislative
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, certainly the governors of each
state has to sign off on all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes through many layers of review.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, there's too many hands
in this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wants cannabis to pay for
all of the different projects and things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've been wanting to do for years
and didn't have the revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, many state local
governments see cannabis as their savior
[SPEAKER_00]: in this respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine there's a lot of internal
battles with the different departments
[SPEAKER_01]: when a state legalizes the industry to see
who takes on the revenue is the best model
[SPEAKER_01]: to create a new division like,
let's say, Colorado's marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement division or the cannabis
bureau in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the best model or is it to be
integrated into the Department of Health
[SPEAKER_01]: or Department of Agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's there's usually
like, you know, a grab for power whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis becomes legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, all these different
agencies want to have their say so in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just further complicates it and
makes more regulations added to which is
[SPEAKER_00]: already a very highly regulated business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes it more difficult for
operators to work in this this arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it would be great if there was
just one centralized body that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: get all of the regulations done in that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you get environmentalists
involved, you get, you know, work safety
[SPEAKER_00]: people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so many different agencies
that get pulled into this that it just
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes a nightmare for operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything countries like
Ireland and other countries in Europe that
[SPEAKER_01]: can learn from the process and try and
ensure that it's a lot more smooth sailing
[SPEAKER_01]: over this side of the bond?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what they should do is try to
model it as closely as they can to alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: and tobacco, where you can have operators
work in this arena, maybe take advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of rules and regulations that have already
been established for alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then parlay that into cannabis to the
extent possible so that it is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite the burden that it is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, next topic I wanted to jump into was
basically unpaid taxes in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: The likes of Matt at MJBs and some of the
other greater articles I've read so far
[SPEAKER_01]: have been highlighted this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be both countries,
Canada and America, are in the high
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of millions of unpaid taxes to
towards their respective governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a part of just normal business or
is this something that investors or people
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the industry should be alarmed
about running up this level of debt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this has been quite an issue for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the taxes are so high that,
you know, many of these companies can't
[SPEAKER_00]: pay these taxes with their working
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they have chosen to do is not
pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, run their business as best
they can and kick the can down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: and hope that, you know, it becomes legal
that these tax assessments at some point
[SPEAKER_00]: get negotiated for a lesser amount,
that they work out some sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement to maybe pay the taxes over a
long period of time, say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five to 10 years and hoping that their
business will then turn around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: interim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's more protecting your capital
for growth and arguing, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: cents on the dollar down further down the
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think this is sustainable?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned earlier before that it seemed
to be that this industry, like other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries, will end up being dominated by
a handful of players in the different
[SPEAKER_01]: territories, like chocolate, like crisp
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's various other consumer packaged
goods that you could point to this where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just two or three big competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a case of in this industry that
anybody who had capital could get into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're now just seeing the byproduct of
the strongest will survive and the weaker
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are the ones falling off and the
ones with good balance sheets and good
[SPEAKER_01]: executive structure and board management
are the ones that are going to thrive long
[SPEAKER_01]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I see this, you know, being similar
to the beer industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going to be some major
players.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be worldwide brands that
are going to dominate the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there will be like craft brewers
and others that are smaller that will
[SPEAKER_00]: still thrive in this industry because,
you know, cannabis affects people
[SPEAKER_00]: differently based on your body
composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some people, one product will have
a great effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another product, that same product for
someone else could be just doesn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once someone finds the product that
they like and a brand that they like and
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect that they get from that brand,
they're going to gravitate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those entities will do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could still be acquired by the
national and international brands and
[SPEAKER_00]: remain as a small craft producer because,
you know, you don't want to lose that
[SPEAKER_00]: following and roll it up into a national
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lose all that marketing power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of brands and marketing power,
we see that the kind of top retail
[SPEAKER_01]: prospect over in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies have already made some ventures
into the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see them being one of the dominant brand
names across every single country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what Berner has done so far has
been pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're one of our clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started working with them when they
had their first dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've become a worldwide brand
and continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be very important in
this industry is branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like Coca-Cola and other
worldwide brands, once you can dominate
[SPEAKER_00]: the market with your branding and people
gravitate to that, it's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what Cookies is doing is really
promoting a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more than just the Cookies
cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have clothing and other things that
would be similar to maybe like the Supreme
[SPEAKER_00]: brand that is this urban lifestyle brand
that gravitates with many younger people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as we said, they've been doing
phenomenal work so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to the day that Dublin
has a Cookies store on one of our main
[SPEAKER_01]: streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy man,
and I'm not going to keep you much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to mention about the
cannabis summit that we've got on next
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much looking forward to having your
expertise on the panels when we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: event next Saturday on the 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first point again, this will be on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to meeting in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, thank you very much for your
time, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
