[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis View.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Alex Rogers, who's the founder and the
[SPEAKER_00]: executive producer at the International
Cannabis Business Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Alex?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the man who runs the best events in
Europe in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great to chat to you with Berlin coming
around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, man, it's coming right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working like dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, all that glitter is
not gold behind the scenes, which it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: as glorious as those few days of the
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to make it seem seamless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you seem to have a great team behind
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys who run the social media and all
of the other people on the team seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: top tier people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So credit to you for finding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a blind hog finds an ear of corn
every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just jump into ICBC Barcelona in
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you come about having the
Barcelona event and partnering with
[SPEAKER_00]: Spannibus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that an ongoing conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a pretty easy deal to get done when
you started?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an easy deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this kind of... When I first came
into Europe, I think it was around 2017,
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the partnership with Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honestly, I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I contacted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's so long ago and so much has
happened in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, I think I contacted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I basically said, hey, I want to do
this B2B event with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were starting up to understand
that B2B was an important element that was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come to Europe because everybody
had seen it already happen in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was a totally seamless
partnership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with Carlos and with Jose,
we've always had a wonderful relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of we just really just
just just hit the ground running with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't look back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really I was really happy then when
I did it because I was I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: associate with other big brands in Europe
because I was the newbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw the value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now and then it was really incumbent
upon me to be like, OK, I'm going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: you the value of this B2B and make it a
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they they loved it because they see it
as a compliment to what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to just make that whole Spannibus week
have that much more fervor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Berlin, Clement, just around the
corner now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a process that you guys go to
when you're choosing the panel speakers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you sit down and start where we want
industry leaders first or we want our
[SPEAKER_00]: keynote speaker first?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the kind of first piece of the
jigsaw when you're putting together the
[SPEAKER_00]: panels?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ask my experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, this is actually one of the
bane of my existence and the scourge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting this putting these these curating
these all these panels and finding what
[SPEAKER_01]: what is is what's the most germane and
relevant topics you need for that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to come up schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis is dog years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we come up with a schedule three
months ahead, four months ahead,
[SPEAKER_01]: we pretty much have to stick to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like to be a little malleable and
flexible because things change so so
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A case in point with what's happening in
Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, I sit down with my with my
content team and my most trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence and experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just we just say what you
know, what's the most germane and relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: topics that need to be talked about right
now in this in whatever respective
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdiction we're having the event in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for young entrepreneurs or
entrepreneurs who might not have visited
[SPEAKER_00]: the ICPC yet, what is the main reason that
they should be attending Berlin this
[SPEAKER_00]: summer for?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, we there's no networking
like the ICBC in the entirety of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody pays five hundred dollars a
ticket or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: People come from over 80 countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just, OK, we're having an
event in Germany and you're going to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: all these Germans.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'd say maybe 25 percent of the people
are German in at the Berlin event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have Americans and Canadians
and South Africans and Australians and
[SPEAKER_01]: Russians and Finnish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Czech and Dutch and Spanish and and
Uruguayans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's truly an international
affair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what network.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to just take two days out of
your life and you want to get the most
[SPEAKER_01]: done, you don't have to travel all these
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all come to Berlin and it's a one
stop shop, a trefpunkt, as they would say
[SPEAKER_01]: in German.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any entrepreneur, OK, you're going
to get information from the panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be stuff, stuff you're
you're you're you'll glean and that
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll soak in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no bigger value than actually
coming face to face with your potential
[SPEAKER_01]: partners and helpers in this industry and
to be able to just have that one on one
[SPEAKER_01]: time with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to network at these events and
especially the caliber of guests that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have make it definitely one of the most
solid after if not sought after events of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year on the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany's recent announcement that made
where they kind of rolled back or did a
[SPEAKER_00]: diet version of what the legalization was
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an argument that it could
potentially be a good thing because it
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the medical side of the industry to
get more validation and to have a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: range of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gives homegrown to a lot of,
let's say, the activist side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any positive with the step back
that they've done or is it all it should
[SPEAKER_00]: have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't look at it as a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it as completely positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people had certain it's kind of
like by the rumor sell the fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everyone we were telling people for
six months that this is what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good chance that it's going to
be a decrim thing first with these social
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we didn't know exactly how the
social clubs were going to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll know that very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's actually going through
Parliament, the Buddhist talk right right
[SPEAKER_01]: now as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we didn't know if they were even
going to talk about the pilot projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mean, there's a few prongs of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an activist, the first thing I said in
2017 when I let off the first Berlin event
[SPEAKER_01]: was that the regulators are going to fuck
shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you need the most is a home
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And decrim of cannabis because that just
takes the wind out of out of the constant
[SPEAKER_01]: constabulary sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as a legalizer and as someone who
feels that cannabis is is the people's
[SPEAKER_01]: plan and it's a human right to to grow it,
to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a business side, I found it funny
when people like, oh, they didn't just go
[SPEAKER_01]: for well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen them go for license and
regulations in certain areas, like you
[SPEAKER_01]: said, that were medical before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen medical get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do a slow rollout like this and a
hopefully methodical rollout.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best for business, actually,
because all people at all the VCs,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the money's not there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to create a diverse batch of
entrepreneurs and not have this limited
[SPEAKER_01]: just to rich venture capitalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how I ever made any of my
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how I didn't rely on those
business, those big multi billion dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses to build the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: ICBC was built on mom and pop businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we have some bigger
businesses to, you know, like the 100,
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 million dollar range in the private
equity side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, we don't we if the money's not
going to pour in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because look what happened when the money
poured in to the Canadian companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had pump and dumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had it really fucked up the industry
in a lot of ways and was a real bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad look.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that all being said, there's plenty of
business that can be done with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: even with the social club model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be talking about that
in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the pilot project model is where
we see it turning into which they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: basically introduce around December,
which will basically a de facto end around
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization because of the EU's
resistance to to license and regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that the EU wasn't going to go
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew Germany was thinking about this
decrim notion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see how the social club aspect
plays out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how the pilot project plays out,
because as far as I understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, they will limit the amount of
patients that are people or participants
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be part of the pilot project
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't limit how many pilot projects
there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can look in Switzerland to start to
get an idea of how this might look in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, there could be one,
two thousand pilot projects within two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three years all around Germany,
which is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some ways, we've seen when it when
it's kind of gray area, which,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we would rather have them just
do like, you know, let's get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's rock it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they didn't, it actually it
actually really helps the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The average person is going to have a
bigger advantage now in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're a big cat, you want to be
the Walmart weed and blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck off anyway, because we don't we don't
we don't we don't need that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want we we're here to have every the
most amount of people have their slice of
[SPEAKER_01]: their little slice or bigger, depending on
how smart they are, how much risk they
[SPEAKER_01]: take, how hard they work piece of the pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want an even playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me personally, I see this as a
just the movement in itself is good,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what, just to see Germany do
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The movement's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to really then how does that translate
into business and businesses thriving?
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see we've just mentioned
Switzerland there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're off to Prague now at the end of the
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that little trifecta of countries
having a massive influence on Europe or
[SPEAKER_00]: out of those three who do you think is
going to have the most successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, adult use market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just no question they're
already there by far, by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even I mean, I mean, who I mean,
Germany has the size, they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: movement going, they have everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see with Switzerland, they're just
they're very, you know, it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: bureaucratic and you can get caught up
with a lot of things in Switzerland and
[SPEAKER_01]: things go slow in general, even though
Switzerland's been really cool on weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for for since I used to live
there when it was quasi legal in the late
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so Switzerland is always a fun
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of business, no, Switzerland
just got decimated their their CBD market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They banked it all on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that now these pilot products.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's not how many pilot projects
are there and who's really doing it and
[SPEAKER_01]: what needs what what has to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For things to get done there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, I don't see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it's going to be as cumbersome
in to start these pilot projects for
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly not these social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're an ancillary business and
you make trim machines or you make extract
[SPEAKER_01]: machines, you're golden in the German
market because that's what that because
[SPEAKER_01]: all these because what we want is more if
more cannabis is being grown, then and
[SPEAKER_01]: more and you used that all these ancillary
products are going to be needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wonderful to see this happen in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's no question that we're
going to see in just a few months all
[SPEAKER_01]: these opportunities about abounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think some of the big winners out
of the German announcement, their
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like Scott's Miracle Grow were
companies that actually sell products for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to grow at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's got to be a massive,
massive market just in regular consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of plants every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then but you have to know that that
all people now can get a surrogate to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be these big grows starting
just under the social club auspices right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your granny and your man, your auntie all
have two or three funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at fifteen hundred plant
gardens because if there can be five
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred people for the social club and
three plants allotted per fifteen hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I don't know about what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in in in in America,
a 15 plant garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you something right now that
those those folks know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to see a lot of American
master growers come over to Europe right
[SPEAKER_01]: now and start getting these growth grows
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll see how how the creative
lawyering, how they how they'll how
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll set up and structure these
entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's we saw, you know,
we saw under this kind of gray area in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw gray area in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got those multibillion dollar
businesses in Canada evaluated under
[SPEAKER_01]: medical auspices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which no one even thought would be
possible a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then certain things happen in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people are like, well,
well, well, well, it's like, who thinks
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a real entrepreneur if
something happens, if movement goes
[SPEAKER_01]: forward and you're like, oh, no,
it's kind of a soft, soft way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a champion way of thinking is we have
this movement, fifteen hundred plant
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens, pilot projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what's going on and where we can
get in where we fit in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's those are the folks that are
going to I think that's going to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the end of the year, I think all
these things I'm saying now are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, oh, Alex was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now people are a little bit naysaying
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no there's I've just seen it
happen in too many markets, too many
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know exactly what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people are going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a huge boon not only for
the German market, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: resonate all around Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just finished the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very, very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to keep you too much
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody who wants to check out ICBC
Berlin, the website for International
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Business Conference is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be posted in all the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't recommend attending this event
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex, thank you very much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
