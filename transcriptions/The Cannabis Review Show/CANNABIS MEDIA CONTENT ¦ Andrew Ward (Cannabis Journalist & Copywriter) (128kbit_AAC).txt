[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Andrew Ward, who's a cannabis journalist
[SPEAKER_00]: and copywriter based in New York in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Andrew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well, doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following you on Twitter for a
number of years now and love your content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've no doubt a lot of people should
know who you are and be following your
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of where you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry now and your original
starting point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel like people follow me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always weird and humbling to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freelance cannabis journalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working in the space for about
seven years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do articles for a place like High Times,
Rolling Stone, Business Insider,
[SPEAKER_01]: Benzinga, a bunch of other publications,
some place out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do copywriting for various cannabis
companies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pays the bills so I can keep in the
news media world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a precarious balance,
but it's been a fun one over the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a lot of blogging, web copy,
the sort of the SEO backend sort of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: on that side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I got into this space about
seven years ago after I got laid off from
[SPEAKER_01]: a freelance job or from a full-time job,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking to go freelance,
but I really wasn't ready for it when I
[SPEAKER_01]: got laid off in January 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took me a couple of months to try
to figure out what market I wanted to go
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was almost actually going back to
full-time because I was not sure where I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was about to smoke a bowl one night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw an interview with Dave Burrell of
the Foo Fighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he basically said, you know,
find someone who will pay you for the job
[SPEAKER_01]: that you love doing, that you're not going
to pay for at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what I took a shot at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used some of my startup industry work to
push my sales experience and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight one or two articles that I'd
written for back in the day about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of took off from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just been really fortunate to
kind of ride the wave and be adaptable
[SPEAKER_01]: along the way and lead me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm doing a little bit more on
YouTube and the media side because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of seeing the tea leaves of people
not wanting to read as much news and just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get accessible and reach out to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just staying adaptable and keeping up
in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've written a few books too,
but those are just other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, doing a bunch of stuff and just
trying to stay as flexible and as
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptable in this wide world of lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you distribute the content seems to be
a juggling act over the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years of what platform, what size content,
how long, the multitude of variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give credit to anyone who can actually
break through on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying myself at this point and I'm
getting maybe about 40, 50 views on a
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube video and a couple of subscribers
here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that feels like good gains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, seeing these people that go
viral and getting the news out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard because I don't want to ever
prioritize getting that big news out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but it is pretty important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of, you know, you have to
look at it from some part of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you have to just
take the news and approach it and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully people will take notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who's not following Andrew on
Twitter already, Canna Rider, the Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Rider is this handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend checking them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me at the moment, the content
creators and cannabis who seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the pop are, as you said,
either investigative journalists who are
[SPEAKER_00]: working in the industry on their breaking
news or their personality or trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn themselves into a brand with consumer
friendly content.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I say when you're going in the
business side of things, it seems to me
[SPEAKER_00]: that like a top chunk of the industry are
already keeping up to date with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not really as big a viewing
pool when you're approaching legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to when full legalization
comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a you're kind of stuck
between a rock and a hard place over the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming years until the industry is fully
professional and fully matured and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an exact consumer base to target with
exact type of content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that, you know,
you pretty much nailed it on the head with
[SPEAKER_01]: the investigative journalists and the
personality side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of have to go one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally, you know, I think
there's a room for both sides,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as it's good quality journalistic
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is with the personality sides,
I've noticed is there's a lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: editorial oversight and not many of them
have gone to a journalism, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: education, whether it be an actual
journalism degree or just even some
[SPEAKER_01]: courses on journalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, I don't know, from my side,
I was a creative writing degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't a journalist, but I worked in the
journalism space and kind of had those
[SPEAKER_01]: understandings when I came into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some people that are lacking
on the quality and the research that I did
[SPEAKER_01]: see on the investigative side.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the converse, you know, the
investigative side is really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people, like you said,
covering the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people covering the
same news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you're catching breaks and
scoops, you know, you're not really doing
[SPEAKER_01]: much, I feel like, other than just
regurgitating the news out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of where I found myself
conflicted on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just not the passion of being a
breaking news writer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather sit down and do a
profile and make sure I got my sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kudos to anyone who could do the
breaking news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I'm kind of finding
myself into the personality side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so much trying, I've been saying
for months now, I'm not trying to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: influencer, but I'm 100% using the
playbook on how to be an influencer to try
[SPEAKER_01]: and get news out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make it accessible to, like you said,
those folks that have that top level
[SPEAKER_01]: information, you know, they're on top of
the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so many people that aren't on
top of the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether they're industry folks or
just, you know, casual consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm hoping that's kind of where I'm
looking at to kind of find my niche now at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a few months, I could be entirely
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could all be out of date.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, yeah, the world of news is
growing, even though there isn't a ton to
[SPEAKER_01]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you really got to find your
space in it because I feel like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you're telling the news,
even then, you still got to be unique
[SPEAKER_01]: because otherwise, why would they not go
to the best investigative journalists out
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So either be the best or find a niche in
there where you are the best and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: start educating people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to cannabis media content,
I think we all grew up with high times
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of being the pinnacle of the media
landscape of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think everybody agreed that they've
fallen far away from their heydays and
[SPEAKER_00]: their glory days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is the top cannabis media content
platform in America as far as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will say I do freelance for high
time, so I'm not going to throw some
[SPEAKER_01]: daggers out of just much, but I do
understand the blowback they've gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, changes in leadership
over time definitely give people some
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've seen it in the
comments and I totally understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would push a little bit back and say
it's a lot more about the individuals that
[SPEAKER_01]: are writing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether it be high times,
whether it be other publications,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really got to make sure most of these
publications, it's the individual who's
[SPEAKER_01]: writing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really follow the byline and,
you know, make sure it's people either of
[SPEAKER_01]: the culture or of a respectable journalism
background or, you know, really who's done
[SPEAKER_01]: their research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really watch the bylines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to that point, to give you some actual
guidelines, you know, some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites, it really depends on what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for American politics
coverage, Marijuana Moment is my favorite,
[SPEAKER_01]: no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Tommy and Joel Collier and Ben
Adler and the rest of that team are some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the top notch people out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Politico is also really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natalie Ferdig and the rest of the team
out there are doing amazing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Jeremy Burke at Cultivated News.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to write for Business Insider.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is now doing his own independent
newsletter and he is a great mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: business and politics and a little bit of
culture as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for the business side of
things, MJ Biz Daily, Marijuana Business
[SPEAKER_01]: Daily is one of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canvas Business Times is also really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will say Benzinga.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did use to write for them, so I don't
want to smell like sour grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, a lot of that is like press
release stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to keep up with the
industry on the press release side,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're looking for more in-depth
business reporting and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might want to steer to the one that I
already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, you know, High Times I still do
read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Herb has some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of it, I think, is also just
going to YouTube and social media and
[SPEAKER_01]: finding these influences.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LA Times did a feature on Friday about
this influencer named Mara Haack,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is also working for Normal and doing a
bunch of other great stuff in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, she's not getting,
she's not a writer, but she's getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: news out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say look for the publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also can look beyond that and just
really find the individuals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really big thing for me at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move on now to an update on New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be ever-changing landscape as
the weeks go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
little overview of, in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, what has really changed from the
last update we had, the court case was
[SPEAKER_00]: brought, the card license were suspended,
and now we have a gap in between then and
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you could fill everybody up on
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you specified which court case
because it could be easily answered what
[SPEAKER_01]: court case, because New York is just
adding more and more as the days go by,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the court case was the
injunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 400 or so, I believe,
licensed retailers that were in limbo and
[SPEAKER_01]: many were really close to opening up the
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the injunction was placed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was a couple of files to
trying to get some of those, I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like 30 or so, to get emergency
injunctions to get them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the case was, or the judge pushed back
on that, continuing to block their access.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, it was stuck and the court was
going to, the case was moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they said probably late September,
early October, would be the earliest we
[SPEAKER_01]: would get any sort of decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state, I guess, decided that we're
going to fold on that and finally open up
[SPEAKER_01]: the licensing to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, we're here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting October 4th, the licenses or
the applications can be officially
[SPEAKER_01]: submitted and everyone can submit the put
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it does take a massive load
of the social equity advocates and those
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping to see more equitable shops
opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's a very fair
argument, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the argument is that New York has failed
miserably at opening up shops and people
[SPEAKER_01]: are drowning in business debt and people
aren't getting access to their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a whole mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really big nuanced argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that one seems to now be
settled, but there's a floodgate of other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones from advertising to specific local
regulations that are now being contested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm no legal expert, but just from the
history of things, we're probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot more common in the next couple
of weeks or months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be that everybody was in
favour of the card licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody would disagree with
trying to get that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you then left yourself with this
stretch of time where the cultivators who
[SPEAKER_00]: had product, there was a multitude of
businesses that were highly leveraged and
[SPEAKER_00]: either were ruining product or were going
out of business and the delay was
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that this explosion of retail
now is going to usher in a new dawn in the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York industry, or is that explosion of
retail stores still a little bit away?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really depends on how quick we
can get the applications approved and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rollout.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I saw with some of the card
applicants, you know, there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: seemingly quick turnaround, you know,
maybe a couple of weeks, couple of months
[SPEAKER_01]: and really heard that there were shops
close to opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's probably going to be a
couple of month process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too certain on how the rollout is
going to be, but I do expect the
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferation of shops, legal license
shops to happen within the next six
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think New York, the governor,
a lot of people are really going to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: save their image, to be completely honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's really about making
cannabis right or any sort of moral
[SPEAKER_01]: endeavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I think from the lawmaker
perspective, it probably wasn't in that
[SPEAKER_01]: way when they were doing it with social
equity for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a look that the governor is
catching a lot of flak finally for the
[SPEAKER_01]: failed rollout of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could totally see them trying to
expedite the process and make those retail
[SPEAKER_01]: shops open real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't confidently say it's going
to happen, but I can definitely see them
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the scale of products, obviously,
the hemp farmers were allowed to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: first with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the state of the cultivation season
over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a huge excess of flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: And were the hemp farmers managed to to do
a good job with the first batch or should
[SPEAKER_00]: have real adult use commercial grow
operators been allowed to get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: first?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's you know, I'm no expert grower,
but I am a pretty regular consumer for the
[SPEAKER_01]: past 18 or so years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my own perspective, the product
that part of me that came out originally
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't that great a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was compared to the illicit market
where you can buy your products from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not really all that vibrant colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell, the aroma really wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for the price, especially
with the high tax markup, it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really a quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a big pushback.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came in the early days of the market
around December, January of twenty to
[SPEAKER_01]: twenty three when the market opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, I told Matt at that time,
we're saying, you know, give it to April,
[SPEAKER_01]: the second wave of crops, the second wave
of licenses are going to bring better
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're going to see better
pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And supposedly that has been the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone to a few licensed dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be completely honest, I've still
stuck with the legacy market and even some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the unlicensed shops that I trust for a
product, because to be completely honest,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of them have better product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are select shops that have those
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think the licensed market
is getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know from my own personal opinion,
more of their products and their pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: are starting to pique my interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the initial rollout of the hemp
cultivators is argued by a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll leave it up to them to say,
you know, if it was the right or wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think New York fumbled the ball in so
many ways with the regulations that it
[SPEAKER_01]: probably is worth scrutinizing this
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that New York really,
you know, kind of just they damaged the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp farmers because they didn't open up
the shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create all these regulatory hurdles
that they were there was hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of pounds of biomass that never
even reached the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these farmers were just they had a
year's worth of crops that were just
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in silos, basically, and just
dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of it hit the market,
it was months late and it was just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of aged product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it just never even reached
the market for anyone to even try and
[SPEAKER_01]: sample and give an opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the public hearings, the public
hearing session that went on with the
[SPEAKER_01]: latest OCM decision before they opened up
the licensing to everyone, tons of hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers were there talking or tons of hemp
farmers, as well as other cultivators were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the problems in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now have two seasons of crops that
are sitting there because they can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one farmer, she talked about having to
sell her tractor in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just keep the farm open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's August when they did this
window and she had nothing else to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people talked about, you know,
self harm and, you know, really taking
[SPEAKER_01]: great outcomes because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's really sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my takeaway when I did a recent article
on the product quality is, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can scrutinize to start with the hemp
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will say yes, some will say no to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think really the biggest problem is
that regulators, once again, made massive
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes, over promised the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I don't know what they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to give money to these people
or help them because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really awkward situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it'll be a keen eye what
keeping an eye on everything that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: over between now and Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we get a lot of good news
for both sides of the coin in the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great talk to Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to do these a little bit
regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do European and New York
information swap for anybody who hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been to Andrew's website yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I am Andrew Ward dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be at the description wherever
you're watching or listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on Twitter, I highly recommend
following the kind of writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Andrew, thank you very much for taking
your time to do this, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be on any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to get you on my show sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
