[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Steve Niran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve has more than three decades
experience in the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_00]: with demonstrated success in numerous
therapeutic sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also the chief commercial officer at
the leading global cannabinoid research
[SPEAKER_00]: and development company Tetra Biopharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Steve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man,
so hopefully we can bestow some knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the audience in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of how you ended up at Tetra
[SPEAKER_00]: Biopharma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, my entire career, I spent it
in the pharma industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, going from Aventus to Shering,
Shering to Merck, Merck to Pfizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pfizer to Bosch Alpha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've always been a pharma boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2018, I mean, there was a
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I was a hand raiser because
Big Pharma was injecting a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: constraint following SOXA, Saga,
Serbin-Oxley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've decided to move into biotech
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, Tetra was extremely appealing
in a sense that we were looking into RX
[SPEAKER_01]: segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe that cannabinoid
receptors are definitely a very nice
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CB1, CB2 needs to be explored,
and we know the active, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's well characterized, and we know
that it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We simply need to develop evidence-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: By evidence-based medicine, I mean,
efficacy in pain management, efficacy in
[SPEAKER_01]: other segments than being an antiemetic,
like dronadinol, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first topic I want to jump on to is
cannabinoid-based drug discovery and
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know Tetra are a global leader in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of what is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid-based drug and how long does
the discovery and development process
[SPEAKER_00]: take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay, a full DDP drug development
plan may take five to six to seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a problem with our investors
base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when they joined, I mean,
they felt that we're an LP, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere a licensed producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this takes time because you need to
file, develop your non-clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you move into dose ranging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go into phase one on LT
volunteers, whether it's toxic or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do dose ranging, and then you start
demonstrating your efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're up to phase two right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two studies that we're running are
called Reborn and Plentitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reborn is ad-to-ad comparison against
quick efficacy morphine, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: oxycodone or hydromorphone or rapid,
extremely rapid morphine sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to displace them,
but we want to be an add-on therapy by
[SPEAKER_01]: which this will lead to an opioid sparing
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know the crisis right now,
the opioid crisis, taking place in North
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's also consequences in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just want to be a player amongst
therapy so that the doctor can reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: their doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's five to six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you file, it may be an
additional year or two before you get
[SPEAKER_01]: approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have planned for EMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have planned for FDA, of course,
and other regulatory bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain to everybody just a quick
little question?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a biopharmaceutical company?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between that and a
standard pharmaceutical company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, biotech, of course, we have no
appetite to run commercial operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you develop your drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you're ready, you run BD
activity, business development,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you sell the asset to a big pharma
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: In exchange of qualities plus upfront
payment, which covers typically for the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire cost of your trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'll give you an example on
quick sleeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: The asset we're working on, well,
we're up to 16 million investments so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time we finish the complete DDP,
sorry, drug development plan, this will be
[SPEAKER_01]: an additional 20 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to attract interest from
big pharma once you complete efficacy
[SPEAKER_01]: trial and you demonstrate efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we're getting right now
in Reborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting positive signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The code is not broken yet, but we're
getting really signal that this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always knew it's working, but we need
simply evidence, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so in terms of we've got a six to
eight year period, got around a 70,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 million dollar investment that's going
to be required.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of that phase, somebody's
developed a blend and a formulation that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be turned into a pharmaceutical
product that could be prescribed by a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor that could be sold en masse then by
a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically the if you know what
you're talking about in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the center of the industry and the future
of the industry, because I think the Holy
[SPEAKER_00]: Grail is going to have your own IP
products that are basically go after
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular disease, neuropathic pain,
chronic pain or post cancer chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the center of the industry
and which will dominate a huge chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: the space over the next 10 to 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine yourself, predict yourself in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think your asthma pump,
those are dry powder inhaler or meter dose
[SPEAKER_01]: inhaler, just like a Ventolin or things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but give the label for pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually, once you don't achieve pain
relief with coxib or with an NSAID,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you move into second layer of
therapy, which is Lyrica, Chimbalta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't work, then you probably
be considered a third options on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of these two therapies to achieve pain
relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the but I mean, by then,
we're hope that our prospect, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: called HOMS Synthetic THC CBD will go into
a pump, you will email it and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: will treat your pain, basically,
whether it's cancer pain or neuropathic
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, like nicely mentioned by you,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely that our chances are better into
neuropathic pain than in any type of pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between biosynthesizing
the chosen molecule and just synthesizing
[SPEAKER_00]: the chosen molecule, is there much of a
difference in the end result and product
[SPEAKER_00]: or is there a more scalable option?
[SPEAKER_01]: Synthetic is much more conducive for
pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea here is that you go to your
typical pharmacy, you go pick up your
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptions being prescribed by your doc
and then you recoup your prescription and
[SPEAKER_01]: your pharma care plan will cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's similar almost to medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's personal cannabis, but there are no
all pocket costs for the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be supported and reimbursed by
the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the issue with LP is that
there's too much offer to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing that they cannot stabilize their
gross margin because the price per gram
[SPEAKER_01]: keep going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started in the business,
it was eight dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's down to two dollars, if not one
point five euro a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Us, we stabilize the gross margin by
having proper IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, we have IP on
Quicksleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to document the aerosol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you'll have if you wanted to
copy me or to generalize my compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to exactly replicate the same
aerosol, which is unlikely to happen and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have 20 years protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of that industry, do you think
it's only initially now at the start where
[SPEAKER_00]: the race for IP and the race for the end
product the consumer will use in 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years has only just begun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this a case that North American
companies are five years, 10 years already
[SPEAKER_00]: into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, we've been studying this for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We acquired Panag and there's something
like two decades of studying the molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: basically on any sorts of CBD receptor,
whether it's CB1 or CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our CSO, Melanie Kelly, is quite she is
quite advanced in studying CB1 and CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's very few companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: GW was sold to Jazz Pharma, Zinerba and
MAD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not LP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are companies studying CB1,
CB2 receptor religiously and making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that we will produce a good drug asset or
drug candidate that will yield a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, pain management, we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about three to four billion
dollars says global sales potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not more.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so it's not it's not small business,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at even I was researching the
size of the chronic pain market around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and the neuropathic pain that those
companies that can develop that end
[SPEAKER_00]: product, get it protected, have an exit
strategy into the arms of one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: already established pharmaceutical
companies to just either replace the
[SPEAKER_00]: current offering they have for their
patients or take it off the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a very exciting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me the next lyric as an
example?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is something for four billion
dollars USA's of per year, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only a global state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pfizer is selling four billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I checked was four billion
dollars says for for Lyrica and Lyrica got
[SPEAKER_01]: generalised lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so now they're no longer cashing in on
on there as much as they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last topic before I let you go is clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific term length for a
clinical trial?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you've got your molecules,
you developed your end product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you now want to be able to bring it to
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys are just working not as a
company, but clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do they take?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the kind of rough process for a
company like yourself to go through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends which label you're
looking for, which indication you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the case of pain management,
the follow up may last two or three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to demonstrate your point,
you need a large sample where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about maybe three to five thousand
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any big pain is pain is a high
prevalence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high prevalence mean large sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it be rare disease like, I don't know,
like our friends at GW did, Dravet and
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonstadt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a sub-segment of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They demonstrate their efficacy in Dravet
and Gonstadt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a rare disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prevalence is extremely low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then to produce a conclusive clinical
trial in that segment, you don't need a
[SPEAKER_01]: large sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recall exactly how large was the
sample for GW, but for us in pain
[SPEAKER_01]: management, it's quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the reason the follow up is
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to select your indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to determine the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a good follow up would be two to three
years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who chooses the patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that you specifically
choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there companies that you can go to that
can provide the patients or where does the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual trial pool come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to establish your eligibility
criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, like I mentioned to you,
we don't want to displace morphine sulfate
[SPEAKER_01]: or opioid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to be an add on on the top of
standard care, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you and our patients who are already on
numerous drug and then on the top of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will have quick sleep or calms.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so like sauce with your dinner,
shall we call it in simple terms?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, right now we're looking into
breakthrough pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking into cancer pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're effective in cancer pain,
likely that doctor will prescribe it in
[SPEAKER_01]: any type of pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you're getting into a zone where
doctor will prescribe it off label.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not promote it in off label
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, once you establish your drive and
cancer pain, good for you because likely
[SPEAKER_01]: that doctor will expand their usage in
other pain management indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing before I go, do you think the
blends and formulations of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: products has got a lot of room still
before people come up with the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: formulas that are going to work in various
different disciplines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it pretty much going to be,
as you said, just a layer on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: current medical medicines that you've been
given by your doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there somebody basically going to come
up with a blend of terpenes, blend of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and B vitamins all together?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done their R&D and over a couple
of years they've perfected this one little
[SPEAKER_00]: tablet that does X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's way more difficult to displace
standard care than playing the game of
[SPEAKER_01]: add-on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So add-on, you limit your risk basically
in injecting money like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually guidelines may lead doctor
to prefer cannabinoid-derived medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: above a PR with at this point will be as
effective as.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You select your Evo and of course the
likelihood of developing an addiction
[SPEAKER_01]: under a POA is quite high with very dark
consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from addiction, I mean, there's an
escalation by which you may land on
[SPEAKER_01]: errands or I mean, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doctor and then the doctor will
regroup, develop clinical guidelines and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll call the shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, these therapy are as effective
as accordingly, they'll be second line and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll pay for second line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you fail on NSAID or Coxib,
you may well deserve receiving a
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription of cannabinoid-derived
medicine, which would be quite steep,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then you will need clinical experience
with the agent in order to displace
[SPEAKER_01]: opioid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is policy really, this is policy
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires solid evidence in order to
displace the second line, let's say or the
[SPEAKER_01]: third line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a sector of the industry
to keep your eye on and I'm very much
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to keeping up to date
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get to chat again in
about a year and see how far along you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are towards getting products on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much for your time to
Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to know more about Tetra
Biopharma, highly recommend checking out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website and their social media
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a company to watch for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Steve, thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
