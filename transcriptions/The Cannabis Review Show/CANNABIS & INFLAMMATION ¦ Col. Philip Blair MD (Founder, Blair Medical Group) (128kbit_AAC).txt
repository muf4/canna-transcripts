[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Colonel Philip Blair, MD, who's the
[SPEAKER_01]: founder of Blair Medical Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Philip?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an absolute pleasure to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy man,
so thank you very much for taking your
[SPEAKER_01]: time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind if we want to give everybody a
brief overview?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know your career is so extensive and
you've touched on so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe just brief it down to how
you entered the field and how did you get
[SPEAKER_01]: into working on CBR under cannabinoid
receptors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to medical school at University of
Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did family practice training and I was
in the army for about 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, I was introduced to cannabidiol
and I did the research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed at the particular benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've treated several thousand people with
cannabidiol, but in about three years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered and I learned about the
extensive interactions with the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and with one
specific terpene that is actually an
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid activator called
beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the work you're doing is very exciting
because I think everybody, if you appeal
[SPEAKER_01]: back to cannabis industry, that the big
gains and the big revolutions are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from the endocannabinoid receptors
and those people who can target these
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors for a multitude of different
ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to bring everybody up to
speed?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are endocannabinoid receptors?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many there are and the health benefits
that they pertain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I can touch upon that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the endocannabinoid system is quite
extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the master regulator for all
the other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It maintains the homeostasis within our
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It regulates the other systems of the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the immune system,
the neurotransmitters, the digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: system, all sorts of systems within the
body, our urinary system, our
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular, all these systems are
regulated in part by this endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system that is an interactive
bidirectional interaction so that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: input and output coming in and going out
through this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not been recognized until about
1994 that it was an entire system of its
[SPEAKER_00]: own, but it has a regulated factor for
many of the different major consequences
[SPEAKER_00]: of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our mood, our nervous system,
our immunity, our gastrointestinal tract
[SPEAKER_00]: are all regulated in part by this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means inflammation is a key factor
for the regulation of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main receptors are the type one
cannabinoid type receptor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid type two receptor,
but there are a host of other receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been termed as the
endocannabinoid dome because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: breadth of the receptor systems and
transmitters that work within the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major transmitters are anandamide,
which is AEA, and 2AG, these are the major
[SPEAKER_00]: ligands that connect up to these
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a host of other receptor
systems and agonists that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: OEA, which is oleol ethanolamide,
and palmitoyl ethanolamide, PEA,
[SPEAKER_00]: are ligands that connect up to these
receptors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also receptor systems called
the PPAR receptors that are also linked to
[SPEAKER_00]: the body and have amazing immunity effects
as well as metabolic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these systems are integrated
so closely that it's hard to separate them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the major factor is that
endocannabinoid disruption or dysfunction
[SPEAKER_00]: in the endocannabinoid system leads to
most of our chronic diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the types of drug discovery and
development that are happening at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment, those targeting various CB1 and
CB2 receptors, we know, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG is an agonist for the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a perfect agonist for the CB1
receptor?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are the most advanced drug discovery
and development processes working on
[SPEAKER_01]: either CB1 or CB2 receptors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the CB1 receptors tend to be our
psychoactive receptors, also inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the CB1 receptors, unfortunately,
have a lot of adverse effects and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: create psychosis and some dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are also associated with
inflammatory disorders such as liver
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be careful about the type
one receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the THC is a classic of a type one
receptor agonist in which we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with for the last 20 years in
terms of orchestrating different
[SPEAKER_00]: connections to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's regarded as a very negative sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the CB2 receptor is the one that
it controls the inflammation and it has
[SPEAKER_00]: neurologic impacts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of the research, there's 35
products that are in the pipeline,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmaceutical pipeline on cannabinoid
type two receptor agonists and chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being produced in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we already have, we've got a number of
products that are actually available
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, palmitoyl ethanolamide,
PEA and OEA, oleoyl ethanolamide are
[SPEAKER_00]: available as a cannabinoid substances that
work on the CB2 receptor and other systems
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the terpenes that is found in
cannabis, but it's also found in numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: other vegetables is cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cariophylline is a superb terpene,
which is a simple oil that is found in
[SPEAKER_00]: basil, oregano, cloves, grapefruit,
guava and avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular terpene has amazing
receptor system activation of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: type two receptors and a host of other
agonists within the endocannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_00]: will modulate inflammation, pain and
neurodegenerative diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blair Medical Group has developed a
product based on the cariophylline in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular that is showing stunning
results in terms of inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and neuropathy, as well as behavioral
disorders and including allergy phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of pharmaceutical
products going on, but we've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: produced a number of products using
terpenes that have amazing properties for
[SPEAKER_00]: activating the endocannabinoid system and
upregulating the system so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: improves the dysfunctional endocannabinoid
disorders that are very common in our
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic lifestyle situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear a lot about the health benefits of
terpenes and how important they are to the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall entourage effect that we get in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the future of the most optimum drugs
going to be single molecules blended into
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations that are targeting one
specific thing acutely or is the full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum planned solution always going to
be the best option?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always going to be the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found in our history of
pharmaceutical development is that single
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting elements miss a major modulating
features that need to be there so that a
[SPEAKER_00]: single target is not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need are multiple targets and a
full spectrum is going to be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've combined the karyophylline
with hemp oil, phenola hemp oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a high quality omega-3 oil with a
blend of different products, different
[SPEAKER_00]: polyphenols that add to the benefits so
that it's a full spectrum potential and it
[SPEAKER_00]: has amazing properties to regulate all
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the targeted functionality of
pharmaceutical industry I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: misaligned and we're learning more and
more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, cannabidiol was developed as
a formulary individualized product and the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement for controlling epilepsy
really requires on the order of a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cannabidiol in its pure form in
order to benefit and control epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a full spectrum you have one
tenth of the amount is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a lot better effects from
the full spectrum from the biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: derived substances and those tend not to
be the pharmaceutical varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: What place do biotechnology companies that
use fermentation and biosynthesis have in
[SPEAKER_01]: the role of producing rare molecules?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an option for the industry moving
forward as a solution to get better and
[SPEAKER_01]: more advanced products out to patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they're combined with these other
products, these other benevolent
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, I think they could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if you could combine CBG
with some of the other compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available with terpenes or with other
cannabinoids, then you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: fuller spectrum and you're going to get a
wider breadth of benefits and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to decrease the adverse effects from it
because many people, the body system is
[SPEAKER_00]: very complex and we don't have a,
not everybody is made up the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that you're going to get a
different response per individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a blend of these products,
you're going to target many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and you're going to miss and
you're going to avoid the adverse effects
[SPEAKER_00]: from the complications of these
individualized targeted substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next topic I wanted to move on to before
we end is systematic inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we know, inflammation seems to be the
cause of 80% or more different medical
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How well do the agonists targeting the CB2
receptor for inflammation work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that the, do you see inflammation
being more advantageous than let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: pain relief when it comes to targeting
these receptors and future medicines for
[SPEAKER_01]: patients out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the CB2 receptor is actually a
neuro agonist and it regulates the
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic methods and mechanisms as well
as the immune mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not widely recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally it's regarded CB2 receptor is
regarded as being minor in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as the population in the brain
in the normal brain is quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we get inflammatory diseases of
the brain, then that population
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerates and we have a large
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though, and it is very responsive to
cannabinoid type two receptor systems that
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit and reduce the inflammation as
well as the neural regulation on those
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to emphasize that CB2 receptor
is neurologic as well as immunologic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the immunologic area, CB2 receptors
are located on every one of our immune
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, no matter what system it is,
whether it's the brain, the kidney,
[SPEAKER_00]: the liver, all the in the blood system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every one of our immune cells has this
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you target that receptor and you
create an agonist effect, then you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: cascade of immunologic system that shifts
the immunologic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want, I don't want to say disables it
because it actually shifts it from the M1,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the activated inflammatory stage
to the M2 stage, which is the resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: and the healing phase of immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it does that, then it doesn't
impair immunity, but it shifts it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: healing phase and it deactivates many of
the cytokines and the inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, as well as the macrophages
that are being invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also regulates the invasion of
macrophages into areas that are involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to regulate the migration of
these cells into inflammatory areas that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to decrease the
permeability of these membranes and these
[SPEAKER_00]: blood vessels to prevent leakage of these
substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes for the gut as well as the
immune system and the blood brain barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: and the eye barriers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the particular areas that we found
with carioflin is that it targets eye
[SPEAKER_00]: disease very specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen incredible responses for
macular degeneration and diabetic
[SPEAKER_00]: retinopathy, which is a horrible problem
to deal with and we're getting more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it targets this area specifically for
regulating the eye disease and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: retinopathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very intriguing subject so far and
I think the amount of progress that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen over the next five to 10
years is going to be pretty incredible to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think R&D approved at a
governmental level is crucial to
[SPEAKER_01]: developing these new drugs that are going
to benefit patients across the border?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think private enterprise is going
to be still able to do these regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislation that happens in various
countries?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be private
enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's going to be major
marketing that drugs are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out, are going to be isolates and
they've already been fraught with
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulties in terms of complications
from their single target measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with naturally occurring
cannabinoids and terpenes, I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a great market for this and I think
there's a great benefit that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't any limit to how much people
can take of these carioflin and these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to get it into the legal
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, hemp products are being
maligned in a number of ways and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted so that we can turn to terpenes
which are normally available in other
[SPEAKER_00]: substances that could provide additional
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Blair, it's been absolutely
fascinating chatting to you and I hope we
[SPEAKER_01]: can touch base in the next six to 12
months and get an update on the amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: work you guys are doing at Blair Medical
Group and thank you very much for your
[SPEAKER_01]: time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just want to mention one other
thing is that Dr. Canna.com is offering
[SPEAKER_00]: the beta carioflin product in the UK and
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll get a link and post that in
the description whether you're watching
[SPEAKER_01]: this on YouTube or listening on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link to that will be in the
description.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you very much for your time
today, Dr. Blair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
