[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Anna Schwab, who's the VP of R&D at 420
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics and also known as Dr. Anubis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Anna?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am absolutely fantastic, even the better
for talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little 60 second overview of how you
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up as the VP of R&D?
[SPEAKER_00]: R&D at 420 Organics and your area of
expertise?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a PhD specifically in cannabis
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: My research was looking at genetics and
phenotypic diversity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after I graduated, I worked for Mile
High Labs for a short time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I got hired by 420 Organics here
in New Jersey a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here for exactly two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cultivate cannabis, so both hemp
and marijuana using aquaponic methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is using fish to feed the plants and
the plants clean the water for the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of all goes in this closed
loop system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very elegant and green method
of farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first questions I was going
to actually display is aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the nutrient value and the
sustainability model of this far superior
[SPEAKER_00]: than the current methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of different ways of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's done right, it definitely can be
comparable or superior to other modern
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is also very finicky and delicate
because we have biofilters, like we have
[SPEAKER_01]: the fish and we have a bacteria culture
and we have some other things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that goes wrong in the system can
just basically link it and everything goes
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really it's nuanced and it can be
difficult because you can't just like if
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants need something, you can just
add a bunch of nutrients into the water
[SPEAKER_01]: because that'll hurt the fish and do other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very nuanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be the more complicated
a process, the better it can end up being.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like comparing an orchestra to a
guitar solo, does it have a lot more that
[SPEAKER_00]: can go wrong with an orchestra if one
person ends up going off to just one
[SPEAKER_00]: individual thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we touch on cannabis biology initially
to first to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: The study of life, the study of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for cannabis biology, it's the study of
the life of all the various genetic types
[SPEAKER_00]: of living plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're talking specifically
cannabis biology, you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: life of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything from seed to consumption,
if you're talking about consumable
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or to products, if you're talking
about industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so basically it allows us to decipher
the laws of cannabis and to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the emerald triangle in America the
best place for naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many would argue it is in terms of outdoor
cultivation because of the specific like
[SPEAKER_01]: makeup of the soil there, the sunlight,
the elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all just seems to be a perfect storm
for cannabis cultivation, not unlike,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there are certain regions of
France that are really well known for
[SPEAKER_01]: grape cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the emerald triangle is really
where cannabis seems to do really well in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to the latest paper that you've
put out about THC testing, testing levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you want to maybe give everybody a
little overview of that paper and the
[SPEAKER_00]: findings that you had from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: This paper was the last sort of
publishable item from my PhD dissertation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of stumbled across it
while I was doing another study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we mentioned this in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking at genetic variation and
can people detect differences in the
[SPEAKER_01]: aromas of cannabis if there's a genetic
outlier for a certain strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is yes, they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I purchased those samples,
I noticed and then I did the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis on those samples, I noticed that
the THC levels seem to be much lower that
[SPEAKER_01]: we tested than were on the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I didn't remember buying anything
that was advertised as 12 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went back and checked all the
packaging and I was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are really different numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we expanded the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some more shopping and found pretty
much across the board that the numbers on
[SPEAKER_01]: the package don't match what's inside the
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're substantially different,
like about 23 to 35 percent different,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a big number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, you know, if you were to have a
beer and it says, you know, six percent on
[SPEAKER_01]: the label, but there was really 12 percent
in the bottle, like that's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same sort of thing with,
you know, that the advertising on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, it's quite a bit different,
although it's lower, not higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it comparing basically the lab
testing at cultivation facility compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to post, let's say, processing where it's
gone through a number of machinery and you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have lost some of the Tricoms or is
it different if the water moisture doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter from the start?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we tested the same way that
testing facility, you know, when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators test before they put the
product on the shelf, they test the
[SPEAKER_01]: finished product, dried and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tested the exact same methods,
the exact same way that you would that a
[SPEAKER_01]: testing lab would test using the same
methods, dried it out completely like like
[SPEAKER_01]: a testing facility would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was no difference in the
testing methods from testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a case now where we already
discussed with a previous guest,
[SPEAKER_00]: have we got a number of labs that are
basically their client is the person who's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the results of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would make sense for them to make
their clients happy and alter the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's multiple points where where people
benefit from having higher results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it all comes from pricing is
basically test is basically set on THC
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, the cultivator has an
incentive to get back higher prices
[SPEAKER_01]: because then they can get a better price
when they sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the labs are sort of incentivized
because if they come back with lower
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, they're going to lose customers
because the customer wants the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cultivator in Colorado,
I mean, every state has their testing
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures that you're supposed to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're the cultivator and you're
collecting the samples to take into the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab, you could potentially be picking and
choosing which flowers you take in to get
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, the lab wouldn't be doing
anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be the cultivators taking in the
premium flower for testing or if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: being genuine and taking in a
representative sample, it could be the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: that is incentivized to increase those
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, it doesn't matter whose
fault it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that matters is that the thing
on the outside of the box doesn't match
[SPEAKER_01]: the inside of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the consumers need to be aware of
that and also probably should stop
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing cannabis based on the THC
number, because that's not a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: way to buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think anybody who smokes and
consumes cannabis now at this stage
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really pay too much attention to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the terpenes and the flavonoids
are getting more attention than a number
[SPEAKER_00]: on the side of the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and we have to remember that not
everybody is at the same place in their
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are still people who are just
starting out, just trying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people don't realize that THC is
not a good way to judge quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas more seasoned consumers,
of course, they know that THC doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to remember not everybody's
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody knows the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic I wanted to talk about,
and you're an expert in, is genetic and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what a genetic variation
is and what a phenotypic variation is for
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who doesn't understand either?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your phenotype is your observable
characteristics, so what you look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the case of cannabis,
that would be growth morphology,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, terpenes, big fluffy buds
versus dense compact buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you can observe either
visually or through your senses is
[SPEAKER_01]: considered your phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your phenotype is dictated by your
genotype, your genetic makeup,
[SPEAKER_01]: so your DNA, your genes, what you
inherited from your mom and your dad,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really know how much of the
environment impacts cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has yet to be determined.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from my research, I found that
environment has quite a bit of impact on
[SPEAKER_01]: the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a grower has different methods,
uses different watering and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: regimes, indoor versus outdoor,
cultivating the flower at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it completely immature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a little bit immature?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also what happens after
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the drying, curing, time to sale,
all of those things are going to alter
[SPEAKER_01]: what you ultimately consume at the end of
the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the future of cultivation that
you see in New Jersey, obviously we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the last year or so you guys came
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it, a year and a half that New
Jersey became the sales?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was last year on four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sort of I don't know if they should
have done it on 420, but they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that was like what
they didn't want to open on 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, it's been a year since adult use
cannabis in addition to medical has come
[SPEAKER_01]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the process of getting people
licensed has been relatively slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the moment, most of the people who
have licenses to sell recreational adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use cannabis is limited to the multistate
operators who are already here operating
[SPEAKER_01]: in the medical space, which is not at all
what New Jersey set out to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's what has ended up happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there aren't really a lot of mom
and pop shops yet that are up and running.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are one of those that is now
building out our facility with our
[SPEAKER_01]: conditional license that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the East Coast of America
seems to be the kind of the new darling of
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to take a number of
years before the certain brands and the
[SPEAKER_00]: certain leaders come to the fore and
you've got the ability to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, because it seems to me it's
one of the only industries that anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's got a bit of money can just jump
into straight away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you only realize that people like
yourself with the area of expertise that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys have are what you need to make
these businesses successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be very interesting to see what is
your overview of the Eastern Seaboard of
[SPEAKER_00]: America at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any companies that you think are
going to be long term around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it dominated by large capital at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a lot of time in my house,
in my office, at my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really get out a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a business person,
so I really don't keep a lot of eyes on
[SPEAKER_01]: the business end of the whole cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm really science focused and,
you know, doing boring things like writing
[SPEAKER_01]: grants to try and get money and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody ever done a trial playing
music to cannabis as it grows and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: the variations that come out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know that there's
anything published out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know of one really talented grower,
and he's actually up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he consistently has music piped into
his plant rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always some sort of some form of
reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like there's some techno
reggae and traditional reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his plants are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that it's his music that's
making the plants grow so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or his particular method of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there are some studies that
suggest that music helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we, and I've had discussions about
this, if we think about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants don't have ears, but they can
potentially sort of gather information
[SPEAKER_01]: about the world around them when a seed is
ready to germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's nothing going on, if there's no
water running, if there's no animals
[SPEAKER_01]: scurrying around, if there's no trees,
you know, rustling, blowing in the wind,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's probably not a great place to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe that's not a good place for
the seed to put all its effort into
[SPEAKER_01]: growing if there's nothing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like the plants are responding
to the environment, to the vibrations and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, because it indicates a
healthy environment for the plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine that music is vibrations
and vibrations would trigger any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: activity in something that would be there
to sense vibrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll have to keep your ears to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can let me know if you hear of
anybody who's doing any such study like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a myth busters about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They set up, I think it was five
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants did not like country and
western music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did like heavy metal, which was kind
of surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't like nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't like the silent room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other kinds, I think there's
classical, they did fine with classical
[SPEAKER_01]: music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did fine with heavy metal and like
rock and roll was fine, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think it kind of matters,
like what the vibrations are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, don't play country and
western for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me just a couple of questions before
you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your favorite consumption method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Food inhalation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have you got a different one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not a heavy consumer and I don't
really enjoy a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have more CBD with just a little
bit of THC or other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of dabbling with THCV right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be good for like your
metabolism and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, if I have like I threw
my back out once and it hurt so bad that I
[SPEAKER_01]: just I was like, I'm going to smoke some
CBD and it kicked it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kicked it in the butt like right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a couple of minutes, my back felt
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it just depends on,
you know, what I'm what I'm looking to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with my life at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to go to sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, alleviate some pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, normally I am an eater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a few edibles myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a favorite place in America that
you like to consume or is New Jersey your
[SPEAKER_00]: home?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one that you like the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I live in Colorado for
over 30 years and I thought I loved
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, but I did live on the plains in
a cow town called Greeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when people think of Colorado,
they think of mountains and Aspen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's not where I lived,
which is really funny because I moved to
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey where everybody thinks,
you know, New Jersey is this armpit of
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, you know, a lot of
industrial like concrete smoke smelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I live in a really, really beautiful
part of New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live between the ocean and the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just incredible, like the
wildlife, the diversity here is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really am liking New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not been upstate to the northern
part of New Jersey, which is where I hear
[SPEAKER_01]: the reputation comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we love like exploring out this
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's like an hour away.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York City is an hour away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Atlantic City is an hour away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Philadelphia is an hour away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in a really nice place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been amazing chatting to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all those who want to check out the
paper, I would highly rate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend visiting Anna's website and
subscribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for 420 organics, check out their site
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the top products over in East and
Seaboard of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, Anna, thank you very much for
taking the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to chat again towards the
end of the year and we'll have some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of movement happening in Europe,
as I'm sure you saw the German rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've no doubt there'll be a hell of a lot
of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The likes of Scott's Miracle Grill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the biggest cannabis companies in
Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for the time,
Anna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
