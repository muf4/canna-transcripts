[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of how you ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: at Flower Hire and your position in the
sector at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually, this is kind of my act two
of my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a lot of time as an education
executive in the beauty and wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and really felt like that was
going to be my career full stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the pandemic when
everything kind of changed around and I
[SPEAKER_00]: lost that career, I was laid off from the
job that I thought that I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a moment for me to really think
about what I wanted to do with the second
[SPEAKER_00]: half of my career and really do something
that was doing good for people and also to
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of something that was growing and
dynamic and full of potential and
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So automatically I thought about going
into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of respect for the plant and
actually came to Flower Hire as a
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate to see if they would help me
find a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was speaking to the recruiters,
we really clicked and they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, why don't you be a recruiter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the rest, as they say, is history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't something that I set out looking
to do, but the stars aligned and I met the
[SPEAKER_00]: right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've never looked back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the best choice ever made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world moves in mysterious ways when
one door closes, another one opens up.
Totally does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping onto the first topic of
conversation is how to recruit talent in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if people are looking for jobs,
there's jobs boards and companies out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got a specific talent that
works in an overall business, first of
[SPEAKER_01]: all, how do you guys find the talent?
[SPEAKER_01]: And second of all, how did the companies
reach you guys looking for the talent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think first, if we talk about the
candidate side, if we talk about people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are looking to work in the industry,
there's two camps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who have worked in the
industry before and who are now looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for their second or third home within the
industry, because as the market is growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and shifting and all of those things,
we do see a lot of movement from within
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabis operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've also got people who,
like myself two years ago, are making that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial pivot into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about the second
group, right, so someone who has never
[SPEAKER_00]: worked in cannabis before and who now
wants to get into the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of things that we always say
for job seekers in general, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, activate your network,
make sure that your LinkedIn looks good,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically, if you're trying to get
into the industry, I suggest that people
[SPEAKER_00]: really take a look and create a resume
that is specifically tailored toward
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that because sometimes the
transferable skills that are really going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stand out to cannabis companies are
different than what they're used to
[SPEAKER_00]: putting on their resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, anything that has to do
with working in regulated environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything has to do with a lot of dealing
with compliance, that is something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavily valued in cannabis and you
should probably highlight on your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have experience in startup
organizations or any type of startup
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, that is also really highly
valued because it shows your ability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptable and nimble in a work environment
that's super dynamic and sometimes can be
[SPEAKER_00]: unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I would say, you know,
do create a cannabis facing resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the tools I like to tell people to
use is there is a website called
[SPEAKER_00]: careersandcannabis.com and there's
actually a free resume builder on there
[SPEAKER_00]: that is catered to the cannabis industry
and highlights those specific skills that
[SPEAKER_00]: the hiring managers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great starting place for anyone who
kind of doesn't know where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a that's the first place that
they can go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the interest and when it comes to
looking for the talent at the moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it what is the most sought after
talent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it economical expertise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the wave of LLMs and AI
technology that's out there, that is it
[SPEAKER_01]: Python coders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it executives who've already worked in
business development and are now etching
[SPEAKER_01]: over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it legal expertise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see the most sought after
talent being in the cannabis industry at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all of the above and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's what I think is so
exciting about recruiting within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about these vertically
integrated organizations, you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see the breadth and the diversity
of talent that these companies need in any
[SPEAKER_00]: of their industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about a vertically integrated
multistate operator, they are hiring
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone from plant trimmers, you know,
hourly workers who are working in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: to directors of marketing to heads of
finance to C suite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they literally are building
everything from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think any type of talent is always
going to be applicable in terms of coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, you know, with the state of
the market as it is, it's a very it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: employer's market, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's more there's probably
right now more experienced cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals on the market looking for
new jobs than ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are looking to build a team now
is really the time to do it because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of folks who are looking for
work and you're going to have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a range of really great people
to choose from, as opposed to in other
[SPEAKER_00]: times when, you know, you go out,
you're trying to hire people and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's already in a job, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, I would say the the most
demand that we're seeing is finance and
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that those roles are always things
that will always be we have a need for
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically people who have experience in
manufacturing, cost accounting and retail
[SPEAKER_00]: finance and planning and analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always really hot jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, anything that's
touching the production side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So manufacturing operations managers,
inventory, procurement, all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things, I think, are always going to be
very much in in demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific state or territory
that's the hot spot for a job at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we don't have federal
legalization yet, but I would imagine New
[SPEAKER_01]: York has a thirst for a lot of the top
kind of talent in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny you say that because,
like, literally on my other screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big spreadsheet of, like,
all my New York talent, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, absolutely, there's a lot of a lot of
movement in New York, and we are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the demand for hiring talent there,
especially on the retail and revenue side,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in New York, they're they're
opening up a lot of new dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking for people who have
really strong retail sales marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: experience to drive revenue in those
retail dispensary outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the same time, you're also seeing
a lot of demand in the emerging markets of
[SPEAKER_00]: the southeast United States, which is
super interesting, because even a year a
[SPEAKER_00]: year and a half ago, like those states
were not even on our radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking about Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri has has
[SPEAKER_00]: really done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that market has really blown up in a
big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the southeast quadrant of the United
States, being these emerging newly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, newly open markets there,
they have a lot of demand for talent as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moving on to the next topic now I
wanted to talk about was what makes a good
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, from people myself or other
companies that I own, trying to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: right candidate, never mind cannabis is
difficult to add in the cannabis factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they know about the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you happy that they're more business
orientated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find the odd unicorns who you can
marry both of those skills?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, when we find a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, of course, with every client we
work with, with every hiring company,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have their, you know, their
idiosyncrasies and their specific things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I think across the
board, people who do well in cannabis tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a combination of a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, we're always looking for
people who have a good cannabis story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis right now, because it is
so it's it's it's highly it's portrayed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the media as a very fast growing industry
and a place where you can make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that the people
who want to get into the industry are
[SPEAKER_00]: entering for the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you apply in cannabis thinking
you're going to get rich quick and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the only motivation you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to cut it because you're
going to come in here and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, how hard the work is and say,
this is not what I signed up for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as cannabis recruiters, what we always
look for is try to dig down and find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the motivation for this person
entering the entering the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because they themselves are
consumers and they have felt like the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has made a positive impact in their
lives and they want to give back?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we hear a lot,
but it's not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone is a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's someone who had had someone
close to them that benefited from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from a medical or wellness
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also people who are just
really love startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe they went through the dot
com thing and they want that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: excitement again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know that they can find that in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's that there's a range
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having a good cannabis story is
probably one of the most important beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, like I mentioned before,
people who are nimble, people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to kind of work in this very hectic
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some personality things that
we find tend to be common denominators,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, with people who are successful in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking about people who are
inquisitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you work in this industry,
you can't just put yourself in a box and
[SPEAKER_00]: only want to know about your specific work
because everything is connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you are a person who is
naturally curious about learning the other
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the industry, you will do
better in in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is we look for people who
are resilient, right, because sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you go through changes and, you know,
crazy challenges that were at a person who
[SPEAKER_00]: was not cut out for this work,
they would throw in the towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say, oh, man, this place is
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a resilient person will say,
hey, this is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we work around it and how can we
get better?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also like to say a little bit
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think sometimes people who
have that little touch of wackiness in
[SPEAKER_00]: them tend to do wellness industry as well,
because you have to really be prepared to
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with all walks of life,
every kind of person you can think of from
[SPEAKER_00]: the most, you know, white collar corporate
person to, you know, someone who spent
[SPEAKER_00]: half of their life in prison, you know,
due to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally someone who has that,
you know, that personality that can really
[SPEAKER_00]: get along with just about everyone is is
also very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've noticed in over two years of
doing this podcast, it started out
[SPEAKER_01]: originally as just gathering data about
the various sectors in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're investing or being an
entrepreneur, you need to know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: facets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over 200 episodes and two years later,
there's a new sector that's popping up for
[SPEAKER_01]: a new law that's popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think got a degree in chemistry,
biology, cultivation, the lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many facets of this industry
that one actually has to be a breath with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just necessarily have a narrow
focus on trying to find those people is
[SPEAKER_01]: the is the job that people like yourselves
are on the hunt to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard work, but we're happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell me this, what are your forecasts
for the next 12 to 24 months in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see safe banking or federal
legalization open up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would imagine that's going to
create a wave of M&A activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which then will drive skill sets from
current sectors that aren't necessarily in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one federalization comes, I would
imagine the pool of talent that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come into cannabis has gone pretty
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I believe that everyone is kind of
holding their breath and waiting for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of like golden moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When when safe banking is passed and then
federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I don't know if that's
something that's right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's still a lot of back and
forth on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get close and then it won't
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like two steps forward and
three steps back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we all knew that that's
what we signed up for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things that we are
predicting is, number one, you are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see a migration of talent across the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're thinking about those
mature markets like California,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, you know, where they have had a
bustling industry for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those emerging markets that I talked about
are going to be importing talent from
[SPEAKER_00]: those states because they need people with
expertise and in the local markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: those people don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, number one, you're definitely going to
see a lot of people physically moving
[SPEAKER_00]: cross country to go to these new markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also you mentioned New York
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think New York will be a game changer in
terms of what the future of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, New York is the the financial
center and the cultural center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, if not most of the Western
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the way that they handle their
market and legalization will be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like an example of what it could look like
for other states, because it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: different from California in terms of the
way that they do business and the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're creating businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a heavier focus on social equity
programs, which is also great to benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that have been
disproportionately negatively affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing definitely to keep an
eye on, you know, keep an eye on New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, I think we're also going to
see a maturing of the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of from a corporate standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is not this is a very not
sexy thing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a recruiter, it's something that we
think about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: As these companies are growing and
maturing, you're going to see them have
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a robust H.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure, which means when you come
into the industry, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: working with like some ragtag group and,
you know, working with the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see more resources
available to you when it comes to benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: and insurance and health plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of these things that you
need resources to offer, we're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see more of that in companies offering as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the maturity of the industry is
going to bring in all the regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits that the banking and financial
sector and other other big sectors do
[SPEAKER_01]: employ.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out of time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been absolutely fantastic talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody looking for more information,

[SPEAKER_01]: it will be in the description of where
