[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join this episode by
Alana Kirsch, who's the CEO of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Alana?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
brief little overview of in a minute or
[SPEAKER_00]: two of your position in the industry and
how you came to get to that position?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you know, my name is Alana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the CEO of the Canigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am based in Israel, actually,
with a global team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have team members here in Israel,
a lot in the United States and North
[SPEAKER_01]: America, and also in Europe and Latin
America, as we expand our audiences there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the Canigma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what we're doing on the Canigma
is we're providing evidence-based,
[SPEAKER_01]: eye-level information about cannabis that
anyone can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the problem we've identified
is that whilst we do have some
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of how cannabis interacts
with the human body, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the easiest way to say it, there's a
lot we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a lot of information
which is kind of obscured by scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: language that not everyone can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were looking to answer any
questions that people have, any practical
[SPEAKER_01]: or theoretical questions about cannabis,
like I said, in a way that anyone can
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that via our website,
the Canigma, and by creating content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my background, by the way,
is digital content.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I've been doing for the past
15 years, is working on various different
[SPEAKER_01]: large-scale websites to create content
that answers people's questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: that connects with people, and that is
clear and easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was very excited when I joined
the Canigma team right at its inception
[SPEAKER_01]: four years ago and was able to combine my
love for the plant with my love and my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience for content creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, four years later, we've got
about half a million users a month from
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the world coming to the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I see it is that's half a
million people that are getting their
[SPEAKER_01]: questions answered and able to kind of
optimize their cannabis journey that
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my kind of quick summary on me and
what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we can delve into a bunch of
different pieces there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have got such a great reputation
at the Canigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
brief what year it started, what were the
[SPEAKER_00]: main objectives when you started it,
and how happy are you guys with the
[SPEAKER_00]: progress and success that you've had over
the years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we launched at the end of 2019,
so a few months before COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what was around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our focus when we started was really
purely medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that more and more markets were
coming online with medical programs and
[SPEAKER_01]: that patients were often left either
completely by themselves when they were
[SPEAKER_01]: making their decisions, because even their
health care providers, even the
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribing doctors weren't able to give
them reliable information about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also when they got to wherever
they purchase or procure their products,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had all different kind of levels of
information about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to provide as much as we
could that could be useful for as many
[SPEAKER_01]: people as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started creating the content,
we discovered that really there were a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of questions that were answering that it
kind of didn't matter whether it was for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical use or for recreational use or for
this full spectrum in between of wellness
[SPEAKER_01]: and health and kind of like therapeutic
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we expanded our focus to speak to
all cannabis consumers from this science
[SPEAKER_01]: indicated data based perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first couple of years were really like
building the content library itself and
[SPEAKER_01]: then obviously starting to build an
audience around that, because what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: use of having all of this fabulous easy to
understand content if no one's looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the first couple of years
getting these, I guess we've got about
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000, 3000 pieces of content on the
website at the moment, getting that all
[SPEAKER_01]: together, both from a kind of editorial
and an expert perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like what do we think that people
should be asking?
[SPEAKER_01]: What information do we think is important
for people to know about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the other direction,
what are people actually asking,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because say I think it's important that
everyone knows about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system, which I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one's searching for endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to get that information about
the endocannabinoid system to people in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we're actually going to put that
information on a page where people are
[SPEAKER_01]: searching for how do I make my own THC
gummies or what is decarboxylation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll just kind of get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take that kind of data and editorial
approach to choosing the content that we
[SPEAKER_01]: create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last couple of years,
our focus has been as well as still
[SPEAKER_01]: driving that audience, creating the
content answering more and more questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: has been finding revenue streams and
brands that are interested in putting
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves in front of our audience,
which I guess you can probably surmise in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of those that see our
audience as a good fit for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been starting to, you know,
trying to work out how to turn it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: business as well as an awesome public
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have got a great reputation for
fact based information and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific theory that you guys
implement when you're researching a story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there different sectors with different
expertise across the different sectors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the person writing and
giving the information, this story is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually coming from the top tier of their
industry because we do see it a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis media where somebody who smokes a
joint things that they know about the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific side of things and the
information can get a little bit lost in
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, yeah, but that happens
everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everyone I know thinks, oh,
yeah, I speak, well, not everyone I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people fall into the trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of thinking, oh, yeah, I speak English,
so I can write an article in English.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I can give a bunch of other
examples there, but you're absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of misinformation in the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so putting together our rigorous
content creation and review process has
[SPEAKER_01]: been crucial to kind of gaining that
reputation that it's really nice to hear,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you saying that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think really our special source is
our expert advisory board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off mainly focusing on doctors,
and researchers, so like patient facing
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians, and then also researchers who
are understanding the plant from a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective and from a clinical research
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started to grow the audience
as we found, as you said, that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, wait, we're writing a piece now on
cannabis extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't really fall into the
expertise of anyone on our board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started adding more and more
experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about 40 experts working with
us, you know, as needed on various
[SPEAKER_01]: different topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do the review process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll generally be in, like we'll
speak with them as an editorial team when
[SPEAKER_01]: we first raise a topic and we want to put
together a brief and understand what we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to cover in an article or a video or
an infographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a content creator comes on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our writers have experience in
the cannabis space and then also as
[SPEAKER_01]: journalists or content producers in some
way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're paired with the
appropriate reviewer who then reviews the
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of red on these articles
sometimes when they come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The expert reviewer is also responsible
for making sure that we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate scientific references on
there, which we make sure to display on
[SPEAKER_01]: all articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just scientific review.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some articles that it's
simply a fact check that we make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we do if it's not a scientific or medical
based article.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have a culinary advisor,
a James Beard nominated chef who we work
[SPEAKER_01]: with on all of our edibles content,
and a regulatory advisor as well based in
[SPEAKER_01]: California who reviews anything that we
create on legislation on cannabis reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most recently, and we've actually just
launched it on the site, we launched our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you this was like a real blank
spot for me when we started on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I at least believe that I'm able
to cultivate cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants are halfway through my first
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll find out soon how good the book
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we needed to add a few cultivation
specialists to our team at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're kind of starting to
dip our toes into psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're bringing on a mycologist and a
few different pharmacologists with
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise in psychedelics to kind of flesh
out the team there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a combination really of
that expertise and the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I kind of described there as I was
talking about the board, that we really do
[SPEAKER_01]: like, this content is, I mean,
expensive in the truest sense of the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of time and a lot of
eyes that go into creating each of these
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really like, we stick by that
process so that we can uphold our
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should say as well, but it's in a
lot of times, it's never ending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even though the content is
evergreen, like how cannabis interacts
[SPEAKER_01]: with the human body is not going to change
from last week to next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's new research coming out all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the things that we thought
we were sure of five years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, for example, the right vaping
temperatures for each cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene, it changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn this is science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the content needs to be constantly
updated and reviewed as well, even after
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been published and adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, new techniques of absorption and a
number of different scientific advances
[SPEAKER_00]: can change that information pretty quickly
in this industry, as we've all seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must find, like myself, that it's
actually a great way to gather data and to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about new topics is to go down this
avenue initially at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think you get opened to a huge
amount of information that you might not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily have got to introduce if
you're just focused on one element of this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, you know, the industry is in
some ways, it's so developed because
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has been part of human history
for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, it's really like it's still
in diapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's new things coming out all the
time, whether it's, you know, novel
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption methods or new brands or new
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, you know, Germany is
going to be huge for the whole industry
[SPEAKER_01]: when and if, you know, they finally get
themselves over the line to have full
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic I wanted to talk about was
advancing policy changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we both agree that the media
outlets are kind of the tip of the spear
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to some of the advancements
that happen, because without the stories
[SPEAKER_00]: being shared and the information and the
knowledge being open source to the public,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to have such a wide
educated voting base and political base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the need for these top tier
media platforms across territories,
[SPEAKER_00]: North Africa, Middle East, Europe,
North America being essential?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see over the next coming years
that there's going to be an M&A activity
[SPEAKER_00]: where you'll see a dominant one or two
brands in each individual territory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the moment, it's a very easy
barrier to entry for anybody can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get in to the media space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks as if there's going to be a
wave of M&A where it becomes even more
[SPEAKER_00]: professional than it already is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it all remains to be seen,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the more kind of positive
media coverage we can get on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you touched on something really
important at the beginning about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the personal stories that are
being shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's especially in countries
which are like further back when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to their cannabis legalization that
they're just looking at putting through,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, a medical program right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really historically been those
personal stories that push each country in
[SPEAKER_01]: its jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the edge and very often, it's mothers
who are advocating for medicine for their
[SPEAKER_01]: children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be, I mean, parents in
general, but often it is the mothers that
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, got kids with epilepsy
that has not responded to the treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: options available is often one of the most
kind of compelling cases when mothers can
[SPEAKER_01]: show, you know, my child was having fits
50 times a day and now they're having a
[SPEAKER_01]: fit once a day and what that does to their
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think these, you know, having these
stories out there in a way that people can
[SPEAKER_01]: connect to has, you know, we've seen in
the past that that's how that ends up
[SPEAKER_01]: being what builds the public pressure and
then pushes these programs across the
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, without getting too much into
the questions of mass media and who says
[SPEAKER_01]: what and why for political reasons,
I try and kind of keep myself back from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think the more stories and the more
personal stories we have out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that, you know, in my personal
life and then also through a professional
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in the past four years in the
cannabis industry, that there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: this progression when it comes to changing
hearts and minds about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first step is like, oh,
OK, maybe it's not a dangerous drug that
[SPEAKER_01]: has no medical application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it has some medical application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are able to get themselves
to the point where, oh, OK, so maybe like
[SPEAKER_01]: people with terminal illnesses,
maybe maybe it's OK that they're getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit high because it's also helping
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, you know, it's step,
step, step to the point where people are
[SPEAKER_01]: able to say, well, you know, maybe it's
cool if everyone just does what they want
[SPEAKER_01]: with either glass of wine or a joint,
you know, on the weekend, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I assume I don't need to like for
you and for your listeners, spell out the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it starts with that acceptance of the
fact that there is a medical application
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis, which is, of course,
what means that it shouldn't be a schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How excited were you about the Congress
yesterday passing this safe banking act
[SPEAKER_00]: and moving it on to the next level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to be a game changer or is
it more smoke and mirrors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I think any progress is positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we're shooting ourselves
in the foot if we say no, no, the only
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to do is full legalization and we
won't take anything less.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's very difficult to run cannabis
businesses across the world and especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in North America in certain states at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anything that we can do that eases
that will help the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flourish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have plenty of companies that
can't work with us because we can't work
[SPEAKER_01]: out the paper situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in terms of like making things
easier for cannabis businesses so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: best cannabis businesses can actually rise
to the top so that we can have that
[SPEAKER_01]: natural progression of, you know,
the conglomerates coming in, which has to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in any developing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have, you know, we need to be
able to move money around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's going to be, you know,
the game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think any progress is good
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just hitting the time there,
Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to continue the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully in the next coming months or
start to next year, we can touch base
[SPEAKER_00]: again and see where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, we've got a cannabis summit
coming to Tel Aviv next May, so we will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely talk before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who hasn't checked out the
Kinnigma website yet, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best sources of content
and information in the industry on a
[SPEAKER_00]: global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check that place out until the next
episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh.
Oh.
