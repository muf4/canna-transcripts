[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode we're gonna be talking
about cannabis storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by Michael
Joyce who's the Director of Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Development for a cookie jar Canadian
company who have designed some incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: new technology to be storing your cannabis
and collecting it and inspecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis storage is one of these ones as
I'm researching the whole global industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've yet to have anybody on about the
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a little bit of research and
delighted to come across the products and
[SPEAKER_00]: digital application that you guys have
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give everybody maybe a
quick little overview of the cookie jar
[SPEAKER_00]: story and how you got to where you are
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll jump into the first topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our founders are two serial
entrepreneurs and they had developed an
[SPEAKER_01]: event based company just prior to the
start of the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all the regulations and
everything and proper safety precautions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the event based business wasn't the right
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd had a conversation with one of our
founder's sons who's a cannabis user
[SPEAKER_01]: shortly after legalization here in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the conversation evolved as he pulled
out a plastic bag with cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and being entrepreneurs and and
inquisitive minds, they started asking
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and quickly realized that
plastic storage isn't really ideal for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows things to interact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows for permeability of air,
all kinds of factors that that really
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease the quality or degrade the
quality of your cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it spirals from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, very fortunate to live in a
world where there's lots of resources and
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of manufacturing options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they concluded that, you know,
storing cannabis in plastic is
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can visit our website to learn all
kinds of information about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the ideal medium for storage
is glass because it's inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, UV glass, UV
restrictive or UV resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass because UV light further degrades
THC into CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it reduces that psychoactive effect,
that high feeling that some people seek
[SPEAKER_01]: out when when consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the story evolves quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of our biggest
differentiators here is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a country where we're fully legal,
but it all started out with medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to recognize that
inspection of your cannabis prior to
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our lid is very unique within the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is airtight, but it's also built with
an edge to edge five times magnifying
[SPEAKER_01]: glass to allow people to better inspect
their cannabis, keep it in that airtight
[SPEAKER_01]: container without having to unnecessarily
expose it to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but there's other factors that
play in here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're one of the first countries
to fully legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been essentially fully illegal
for for almost 100 years here in North
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of misinformation out
there, unfortunately, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: propaganda or misleading statements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of what our company is about is
is helping educate people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on on the importance of access,
the importance of how it's produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's stored is vitally important for
the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of what we do with our our app,
the cookie jar app, which is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: free and available on iOS and Android is
provide people with information to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them educate themselves on the potential
benefits of cannabis, how it might
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with them, how it might help them
with various different struggles that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell me one of the things that
I'm sure a lot of people want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: about when it comes to cannabis storage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the kind of, let's say,
the two biggest things that are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in your cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not storing in an airtight glass
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the two big things that consumers
of cannabis need to be informed about and
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason why they should be upgrading
their storage component?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably the two biggest factors will
be airflow and light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So airflow oxidizes THC, which is one of
the most common and sought after
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it oxidizes, it becomes CBN and just
doesn't have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still medical benefits to it,
but it's not what people are necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second factor is going to be light
because UV does degrade THC as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are probably the two biggest
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third would be humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like any foods, really, they're
susceptible to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there is too much humidity,
you're more likely to develop molds or
[SPEAKER_01]: mildews, which we don't want to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's too dry, that dryness dries
out the terpenes and the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: structures in your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your trichomes are really what contain
the vast majority of the cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_01]: most people seek out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the top two would be airflow and UV
light, exposure to UV light, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: followed closely by humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you give the viewers an exact
whereabouts of you guys in Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: where are your products available in that
territory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys branched down into America
as of yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're based in Ottawa, Canada,
so our nation's capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our products are currently available
right across North America, Canada and the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have distribution points in both
countries, and we are looking at expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: into the rest of the world more readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you guys see a position as a
consumer storage that you guys are mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on, excuse me, or is there a
massive difference between, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale storage for the bulk providers
and a consumer storage and are you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: pivoting into both sectors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to stick to consumer side of
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So predominantly, our focus is on the
consumer storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legal growers and the industry level
people typically have great storage in
[SPEAKER_01]: their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our main focus is on the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, we do have some products
that are in development, we'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are more suited towards licensed
producers for them to be able to start
[SPEAKER_01]: preserving those important cannabinoids
and terpenes earlier on in the process so
[SPEAKER_01]: that at the end of the day, the end
consumer does have a product that that is
[SPEAKER_01]: superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just talking there briefly
before we came online that you guys are in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lockdown over in Canada at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the pluses is that you've got a
legal cannabis industry with curbside
[SPEAKER_00]: deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has been the biggest product you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: We read a lot about Oxley taking a lot of
the share from some of the big providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing that small cultivar taking
a major share from the big, huge bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: providers as we're starting to read from
this territory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at the statistics
from a couple of years ago, kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: big five, the five largest volume
producers controlled, I think it was about
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 percent of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now it's it's much more on the
craft side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smaller growers that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're doing a great job,
you know, but they're really dialing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the specifics of, you know, temperature
and light penetration and nutrient balance
[SPEAKER_01]: and pH and how long to to vegetative
growth and how long to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just seem to be going that little
extra mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are seeing it here in Canada that
that those craft growers, the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are putting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the taking the minutia of the
plant and and focusing on it, focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: the littlest aspects, they're making a
little bit difference here, a one percent
[SPEAKER_01]: growth here, one percent growth here,
improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are eating away at that market
from from the big five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five businesses here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's it's nice to see because
there is a lot of variety coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's growers out there that are using
different grow mediums that are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more environmentally conscious with
how they're producing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are working with, you know,
marginalized minorities or different
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's really it's it's wonderful to
see because the restrictions here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada have been lightened, we'll say,
or lessened to a degree in getting through
[SPEAKER_01]: that license producer application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have newcomers to the industry
quite regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are seeing a huge influx of that
craft growing mentality and the
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of quality craft cannabis
here in Canada, much, much like we
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced with with beer and alcohols
over the last kind of decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives people options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, as long as they're making
informed decisions, we're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the few industries where I
don't know any cannabis consumer where if
[SPEAKER_00]: we went up and said, look, here's a half
of ounce of the best weed in the world or
[SPEAKER_00]: here's two ounces of this crap weed that
anybody's going to take the two ounces of
[SPEAKER_00]: the crap weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets the one industry where I
don't think there is a low tier market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think the craft suppliers will
be able to cater to the people with a
[SPEAKER_00]: nuanced taste and exact product that
they're looking for, as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Coke or the Pepsi of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're very right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is it's an interesting
perspective here, because particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Ontario, you know, our province,
there is a huge shift in marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and kind of the market perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have something here that the
government has implemented called an
[SPEAKER_01]: excise tax, which basically tax is based
on quality is kind of the best way I can
[SPEAKER_01]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the better the quality product,
the more tax you're paying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually I don't know of any other
industry where where something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens, where you're paying more tax per
a superior product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of over the last year or so,
there's there's been, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: for lack of a better, better term is price
wars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are seeing really quality cannabis
from a huge number of growers here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada that is priced below market value
because they have to do something to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in a bit of an interesting area,
an interesting time for cannabis here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're we're very lucky that our
federal government is going through an 18
[SPEAKER_01]: month review right now to kind of look at
the whole industry over the last three
[SPEAKER_01]: years and and reestablish things,
because, you know, the excise tax is a is
[SPEAKER_01]: a big aspect, but also it's a it's a whole
new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody coming into it was was very
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I want to use an industry term,
you know, so it'll be interesting to see
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of in the next 15 months or so or 16
months where where the government wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of give and take a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, with the price wars that
are going on with so much of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flower specifically on the market
being undervalued, there are discount
[SPEAKER_01]: brands popping up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go and buy an ounce of cannabis
here in Canada for one hundred dollars,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a very reasonable price,
if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are also, you know, the
consumers that that really do care about I
[SPEAKER_01]: just want the best quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want something that's going to
do this or I want something that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this and help me relax or help
stimulate my appetite or help me with
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or pain or, you know, and that's one of
the things that that we here at Cookie Jar
[SPEAKER_01]: are really focused on is is helping people
understand that cannabis isn't just used
[SPEAKER_01]: to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's actually it's a miracle
drug, if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like using the term drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the oldest in human
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, on that note, we've come up to
our 15 minutes time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we get to touch base again in
the towards the end of the year and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: see how you guys are getting on.
