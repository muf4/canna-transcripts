[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Jesse Redmond, who's the founder and
[SPEAKER_00]: managing partner of Higher Calling LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following your Twitter landscape
for a number of years or a number of time
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview in under 60 seconds of what your
[SPEAKER_00]: position is and how you came to be in the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I've had a bit of a strange
career where I spent 20 years on the
[SPEAKER_01]: investment management side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked at Fisher Investments in Franklin
Templeton in San Francisco, and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: co-managed a couple of hedge funds in
Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2016, I put aside the investment stuff
and started focusing on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: founded a dispensary outside of Santa
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that for about three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the last couple of years,
I've been focusing on blending that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and investing knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been interesting to watch the Twitter
MSO investment community, shall we say,
[SPEAKER_00]: gather over the last year and the
positions everybody seems to be taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
brief little overview of the Higher
[SPEAKER_00]: Calling LLC?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the objective with your firm and
what you guys do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's an investment consulting
business that I started in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea there was just to help
investors find the best and most
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate cannabis investments for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for some people, that may be a
portfolio of individual stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like Green Thumb Industries and
Cura Leaf and Verano and True Leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: individual names like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for other folks, it could be a venture
capital fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of good venture capital
funds out there that invest in earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: stage businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some great hedge funds out
there for people that are qualified and
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in vehicles like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also some excellent ETFs as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there isn't, you know,
like a lot of investing things,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not about there being one best
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about understanding somebody's needs
and objectives and then fitting the right
[SPEAKER_01]: solution for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I try to do with with
Higher Calling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got started with some larger family
offices that I worked with on the hedge
[SPEAKER_01]: fund side that were interested in getting
cannabis exposure, but didn't want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: all the work themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you probably know, it's a bit of a
complex and nuanced space due to the state
[SPEAKER_01]: by state regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't even account for the
differences between Canada and Europe and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, cannabis is a bit of a
difficult space.
[SPEAKER_01]: to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people want to outsource that
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how that got started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've just been building it out,
building it out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's great to see the position
you're taking and the audience and
[SPEAKER_00]: influence that you're gathering in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topic of this episode is basically how
to invest in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to kind of maybe give
everybody a quick little overview of a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of different ways and models and
methods that regular people can get into
[SPEAKER_00]: investment in cannabis stocks,
because it is definitely a medium to long
[SPEAKER_00]: term play that everybody should look at it
if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, what platform would
you use to invest in cannabis stocks or to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase cannabis stocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific cannabis based one or
is just a regular platform that investors
[SPEAKER_00]: use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's a little bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a nuance where the US cannabis,
the plant touching businesses can't trade
[SPEAKER_01]: on things like the New York Stock Exchange
and the NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the US companies go public in
Canada and then have dual listings on the
[SPEAKER_01]: OTC exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to invest in US plant
touching operators, names, like I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned earlier, green thumb industries
or cure leaf, which I think are some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most compelling opportunities,
you need to have a brokerage account that
[SPEAKER_01]: allows you to A allow access to access OTC
names or B or and B allows you to access
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one easy solution for that is
fidelity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I use for a lot of things
that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other platforms out there like
Robin Hood, which is a big retail
[SPEAKER_01]: platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, and they don't allow purchase
of these OTC cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a broker by broker
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think partially based on what they see
as the demand and partially some still see
[SPEAKER_01]: some regulatory risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to get safe banking last fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think until we get safe banking or
rescheduling, some of these brokerage
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms and custody platforms are still
going to be a little bit nervous about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, you could buy the OTC
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, but there's also great
options for ETFs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we hear a lot about is like the MSOS
ETF, which is the largest ETF in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that provides access to US
basically broad access, almost index like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not an index, but it's index index
like exposure to US cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also personally invest the ETF,
the Poseidon Dynamic Opportunities ETF,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has the ticker PSDN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that one because I think it has
a little bit more experienced team on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis side and a more focused portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ETFs use swaps to get access to
the OTC names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they don't actually hold those
underlying names, they can be listed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the higher exchanges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like the ticker MSOS and the
ticker PSDN, you are able to buy on more
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms than you can the actual
underlying individual names like a GTI or
[SPEAKER_01]: a Cure Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say somebody realizes that they
found a platform that they want to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to invest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you specifically pick your strategy
towards acquiring specific stocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cash balance sheet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it assets that they own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it future earnings that you think
that's going to come in the door?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a couple of different parameters
that you would set that all investors
[SPEAKER_00]: should be using these one or two different
or one or two, three different parameters
[SPEAKER_00]: to judge what to purchase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it basically just research,
research, research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a little bit of all of the
above, but I always think of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: first and foremost as a state led growth
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say that, I mean, we have 21
adult use states today, so that leaves us
[SPEAKER_01]: 29 more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each state has its own regulations,
which can be complicated and pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: specific to that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have states like New Jersey,
which are excellent states for the
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-state operators, high margins,
limited number of stores, limited number
[SPEAKER_01]: of licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cure Leaf has a store in Belmar,
New Jersey that's on track to do $72
[SPEAKER_01]: million in sales this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are huge stores in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey is a great environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get as much exposure to
those limited license states, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that just moved from medical to adult
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You contrast that with where I live,
which is in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And California is a very challenging state
for cannabis operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have too many cultivation licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a mismatch between supply and
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about a thousand stores here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need closer to five to 10,000 to be
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're looking at investing,
you could have a great business and a
[SPEAKER_01]: great idea like Glasshouse Brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you put them in the most
challenging environment in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_01]: it still is going to be difficult for that
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the flip side, so you have states like
California, which I don't make dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: investments in, but usually with these
multi-state operators, let's keep talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about Green Thumb, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get exposure to New Jersey,
which they have, you have to take some
[SPEAKER_01]: other states along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those bigger blue chip names are often
in five or 10 different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want New Jersey, maybe you have
to take an Arizona with it, which is more
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging, or Massachusetts,
which is more challenging, or Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is more challenging, or California,
which is more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about understanding where those
exposures are at a state by state basis
[SPEAKER_01]: and investing on what you think are going
to be the best environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's number one is focused on the
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two is you have to understand the
climate that we're in today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we got safe and lending opened up and
investment opened up, then I would say it
[SPEAKER_01]: may make sense to dip into some of the
smaller operators or debt-laden balance
[SPEAKER_01]: sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we didn't get safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably in a recession in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and interest rates are really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under those conditions, I always think
back to a conversation I had with the CEO
[SPEAKER_01]: of Ascend Wellness, Abner Curtin,
who said, it's not about finding the
[SPEAKER_01]: stocks right now that'll go up 200% rather
than 150%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about avoiding the ones that are
going to go to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think about that almost every day,
because in this environment, there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much opportunity in cannabis because the
prices are so depressed and we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: series of catalysts ahead of us,
but you need to be in the ones that can
[SPEAKER_01]: survive today and thrive tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on top of that state by state
component, I would focus on stocks that
[SPEAKER_01]: have scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be focused on stocks that have
strong balance sheets without too much
[SPEAKER_01]: debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be mindful of near-term maturities
because it may be hard to refinance those
[SPEAKER_01]: in an environment like 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would look for businesses or
multi-state operators that have exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: to expanding markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Connecticut's just turning on.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York is just turning on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhode Island is just turning on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Maryland and Missouri turning on
later this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in today's environment, I think it
makes more sense to be a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative, focus on the more blue chip
names with the more sound balance sheets,
[SPEAKER_01]: but do that being mindful of what states
you're in and also trying to get exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: to new states that are opening because
newer states typically have greater
[SPEAKER_01]: margins and more revenue per store when
they first open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible wealth of information
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a market at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, first and foremost, do you think
that New York is ever going to catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: with California in terms of size of market
or is California always going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: leading state in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that demand-wise, it could be
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York is a big state, has a lot of
cannabis culture and consumption over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think New York will be a strong
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from a cultivation perspective,
California is climbing the limit is just
[SPEAKER_01]: so much better that people will argue
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But California, I think, will still be the
leader in terms of innovation and quality
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe one day we export stuff to New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we ever get interstate commerce,
I think that's probably going to be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you go to these illegal bodegas
in New York, they all feature California
[SPEAKER_01]: products because that's ultimately what
consumers want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think New York is a good opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The initial regulations don't look super
favorable to the multi-state operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they can't open their first
adult-use store until three years after
[SPEAKER_01]: any adult-use stores open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're essentially giving the social
equity operators a big head start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a decent cultivation and
wholesale opportunity to feed those social
[SPEAKER_01]: equity stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that, broadly speaking,
that the initial regulations have not been
[SPEAKER_01]: real favorable for the MSOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that people that have
assets there, like your Crescos,
[SPEAKER_01]: like your Cure Leafs, I think they've been
a little bit disciplined.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been appointed in the initial
drafts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe those things will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it just may take a few years
for that to be a real profitable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a market for things like
distressed assets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with the uncertainty in America,
do you think that there's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: position to acquire distressed assets and
for that to be a workable option?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to think about why is it
distressed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're in a state like Michigan
with too much cultivation and you are a
[SPEAKER_01]: grower in Michigan and you're losing money
and it's really cheap to buy it,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you might just buy it and keep
losing money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think you need to be careful
about which distressed assets that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that cultivation in and of itself
is not a very interesting thing to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think retail is more interesting,
or even better, is vertical integration,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you pair the retail with the
manufacturing and distribution and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, because they have higher
margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives you greater control of the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are select distressed
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have to ask, who has the
money these days, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In this environment where you don't want
to do an equity raise because your share
[SPEAKER_01]: prices are so low and the cost of capital
has gotten so high, like Glasshouse fans
[SPEAKER_01]: did a rates prefer deal that was 20% to
25% interest rates with a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: warrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you borrow money at 20% to acquire
distressed stuff, A, that's a high cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And B, I think you want to be real
selective in terms of which assets in
[SPEAKER_01]: which you would invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I wanted to mention was
Green Giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had come across where I think it's
been a great wealth of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give maybe a quick overview
of Green Giants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a website I started,
I guess, about a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And initially, it had a feature where
there was a premium service.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could pay for portfolio positions and
trade updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, the payment provider canceled
that option, because they didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: people paying for cannabis-related
content, which makes no sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was selling information about cannabis
stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the world we live in with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that feature went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I just treat it as a place to
share things that I write and share
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's about 60 different articles
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lately, I've been doing a bunch of
interviews with different investment
[SPEAKER_01]: managers in the space and different
operators in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's free to subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to learn about the
investment cannabis, that's really what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend everybody checking it
out and going to visit the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I wanted to touch on before
I let you go is, do you see, as a North
[SPEAKER_00]: American investor, value in European
cannabis stocks at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you still a number of years away
from taking a position?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think Europe is definitely
interesting, especially as the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think expectations may be a little bit
high, because the one thing I've seen over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over in cannabis is things take longer
than we expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of optimism around
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently sat in on a call with a couple
of German experts, and they were 50-50 on
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we would see sales in 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if not 24, for sure 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if Germany turns on in the next year or
two, I think that sounds like a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like we see in the US,
when one state turns on, often the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighboring states do as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we could see that in Europe as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Germany falls, then we might see other
countries across Europe turn on as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I think Germany is definitely an
interesting opportunity in and of itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also a great way to complement a
US-based portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you own some of the big MSOs or a
few of the single-state operators,
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead and add some European exposure to
diversify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like in normal stocks, a global
portfolio is often better than just the
[SPEAKER_01]: US-only portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher risk-adjusted returns, more
opportunity, less volatility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those same conditions apply to
cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mentioned CureLeap earlier,
and they're one of the few US MSOs that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really dedicating themselves to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a German business that they
acquired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could get that through someone
like CureLeap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, if you want to hunt around for
specific opportunities in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's definitely a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Europe is going to lead more with
biotechnology and biosynthesized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids than actual cultivation
because the industry is just set up
[SPEAKER_00]: completely over here for that to be able
to be facilitated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been phenomenal talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't recommend everybody checking
out Green Giants and following Jesse on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter, at Jesse Redmond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much appreciated, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we can twitch base towards the
middle of the end of the year and get an
[SPEAKER_00]: update and see where the stock positions
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
