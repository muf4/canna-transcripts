[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis View.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined by Gianni del
Rosario Macridis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Gianni?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's late in the evening over there
and you've got a lot of studying ahead of
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a privilege to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody an
overview in a minute or two of what your
[SPEAKER_01]: area of expertise is and how you find
yourself in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was actually quite lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed career when I was in my late
20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to work in an office for a
freight and logistics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that that wasn't really
what I was passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a big decision to just move out
of that career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to South America where I lived
with local people all across the
[SPEAKER_00]: continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I volunteered on farms and
I did a lot of couch surfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during that year, I learned how they
use plant medicines over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really saw the benefit and it really
intrigued me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came back to Australia,
I decided to start studying botany at La
[SPEAKER_00]: Trobe University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, I got into an honors
project, which is sort of in between an
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate and a postgraduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was based on plant biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to realize the potential of
genetic engineering in plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that it can solve for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I got a job with a cannabis
cultivation company here in Melbourne,
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met some professors from
another university who said that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: a project for me in Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: on medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the stars aligned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I got into studying and
researching cannabis genetics at La Trobe
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I focus on trichome genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: First topic I'm going to start off with is
cultivation in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give us who are the best
cultivators in Australia and who has the
[SPEAKER_01]: best genetics in Australia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's kind of a dicey topic at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of competition and it's very
secretive because of the high competition
[SPEAKER_00]: between companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I no longer work directly in the
industry, but I do have four years
[SPEAKER_00]: experience working for one of the major
cultivators in Australia and who are
[SPEAKER_00]: called Can Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the first company in Australia
to get a license to manufacture cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is another company called ECS
Botanics who are doing really well in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are taking out all the awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main difference between someone
like Can Group and ECS is that Can Group
[SPEAKER_00]: specialize more in indoor cultivation and
ECS are all about outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outdoor cultivation model seems to
be prevailing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if that's exactly got to
do with their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of research and development
that companies have done to get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, including importing them from
overseas like Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's it's got a lot to do more
around the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive to run a indoor
facility and the outdoor model has been
[SPEAKER_00]: able, I guess, to keep costs low.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you mentioned genetic engineering then
in your discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've heard of bio harvest
sciences in Israel who were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate glandular trichomes on a mass
scale and bioreactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see this is the kind of future side
of the ingredient side of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're able to make cannabinoids and
molecules 100 percent pure and replicate
[SPEAKER_01]: that over and over again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see that plant matter is always
going to have a say in the ingredient side
[SPEAKER_01]: of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there are definitely two sides to
the argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I I sit more on the whole plant side
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of people in the
industry like Dr. Ethan Russo believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the same kind of model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the plant does it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that was one of the quotes from
his papers that the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the full spectrum of molecules produced in
the cannabis plant seem to have this
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect where they can have more
therapeutic benefits than single molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say that there isn't a
purpose for single molecule drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in terms of cultivating and yielding
these auto cannabinoids, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be more effective to
do that within the plant rather than these
[SPEAKER_00]: lab lab situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, one of the biotech
companies, if they're being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate their own cannabinoids and then
get mixtures or blends and formulations of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and create their own recipe,
do you see that as being a more
[SPEAKER_01]: advantageous route than extracting plant
matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because surely for the environmental,
the actual overall cost and the production
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity that these guys are going to be
able to do, that there's going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be an inflection point where if the
ingredient that people are buying,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't really understand too much
about it, then the blends and formulations
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be what everybody's going after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that the blends are a great
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of putting different compounds
together, like the cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and sort of blending them from
different sources, I think that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's going to be more
futuristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there's not enough clinical
information to understand what works best
[SPEAKER_00]: with what in terms of specific illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how it stands at the moment,
it might not be as necessary right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to sort of look to where
the puck is heading, as they say in ice
[SPEAKER_00]: hockey, then potentially these new ways of
putting together specific formulations for
[SPEAKER_00]: particular illnesses or to generate
particular benefits, that could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: really exciting area of industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it seems to be that if you
actually move just over to the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things, that if we're going to
have cardiovascular information or
[SPEAKER_01]: gastrointestinal information, that these
specific cannabinoids are a key ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: and that there's no way a cultivation
facility is going to be able to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: the quantities that, let's say,
a Pfizer is going to want if they get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good recipe for a drug in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing too is you have to
think about the target market too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think most of the cannabis
community are super prepared to take on
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations like that from big
pharmaceutical drug companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, we're talking about
patients that are not necessarily within
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis community, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole idea is we want to expand the
reach of cannabis medicine to all people,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of what they do and do not know
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is potential there, but I also
see a little bit of pushback from the real
[SPEAKER_00]: diehard medicinal cannabis fans who might
not be willing to take that on just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems to be that these big
biotech companies and pharma companies can
[SPEAKER_01]: see that broadening the patient range is
what their aim is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're always going to have the
diehards who couldn't really tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between an endocetiva anyway,
but they just have their own hard stance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way they're feeling about a
specific topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a global scale, if you're able to
reach another 30, 40 percent of patients
[SPEAKER_01]: that have no interest in cannabis
whatsoever, but are going to be happy to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a pill or a capsule or whatever,
a topical formulation, I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the benefits of this genetic
engineering is going to pay dividends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that patient footprint is
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're already starting to see it grow,
especially here in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of clinics and
dispensaries that are starting to pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: all around the country in various states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are being inundated with calls
from patients who have tried a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other things for their illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are looking into medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, you have this need for
homegrown cannabis being pushed for by
[SPEAKER_00]: advocates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also by recently elected political
parties here who are introducing bills
[SPEAKER_00]: into the parliament to allow the home
growing of cannabis for people that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go through the clinical
dispensaries and prescribers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you definitely start to see a split
in Europe where pharma and biotech are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be developing brand new novel
drugs and being able to take care of,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, cosmetics and beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you'll be able to placate the
activists and the the industry people have
[SPEAKER_01]: been around for decades with a home grow
rule with you can have three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and this not for profit kind of a
social club model is going to pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question I wanted to ask you was
how would somebody improve their their
[SPEAKER_01]: home grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any specific things that
somebody look I'm trying to grow two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three plants at home for X ailments?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the two or three things that I
should be looking at to ensure that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the best cannabinoid and trichome
balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I think is important is
the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that you have got
seeds or clones from a reputable breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you're growing the variety,
we say in science, the cultivar that is
[SPEAKER_00]: suited for your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would want to know a bit about the
cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the density of trichomes,
leaf, the flower morphology, the
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture of the plant so that it fits
within your growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know growing at home can be quite
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first point of core protocol
with with growing at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think it's just a matter of
really getting into the nitty gritty of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes back down to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lighting plays a big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also nutrients plays a big part as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you're growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to make a decision of whether
you want to grow in soil or soil less
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we're really lucky these
days or a lot of information is being
[SPEAKER_00]: published online about the best
cultivation tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you if you start with those
three or four things and then you're on a
[SPEAKER_00]: good path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a reason if you look
at the most profitable and largest
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis companies around the world,
Scott's Miracle Grower, I think two
[SPEAKER_01]: billion bigger than most of the big MSOs
in Canada and America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's where it's going
to sweet spot is going to be that the
[SPEAKER_01]: trays, the soil, the lighting,
the nutrients that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: given is going to be a big industry when
it comes to Europe and no doubt Australia
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, yeah, I'm looking at ways of
trying to help people out with that here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Australia and and make the most of
their home grow in anticipation that these
[SPEAKER_00]: laws are going to pass in the next six to
12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what effect that will have on the
local industry we're not quite sure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, not everyone is going to want
to grow their own cannabis, just like not
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone grows their own vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there is going to be a
substantial proportion of the market that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to grow their own just because of
the cost, but also because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyment of of growing your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think everybody initially when
they're allowed to do are going to put
[SPEAKER_01]: their finger and try and attempt to do,
but they're going to soon realize how
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult it actually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we discussed that the social club
model seems to be what's going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: most palatable thing for a lot of
politicians to give adult access used to
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the story with that in Australia
at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so at the moment, like I mentioned,
the laws for home going have not yet been
[SPEAKER_00]: passed, but the bill that's being proposed
at the moment does have provisions for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure what its purpose mainly
is in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this field, what they're proposing
it for is for people who don't have room
[SPEAKER_00]: at home to grow their own or don't have
access to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for renters who might not be looked
upon greatly by their landlords who are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can allow these cannabis clubs to
grow your cannabis for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the proposition at the moment in
the legislation that's being proposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully now, mate, we in Europe
and in Australia, we get these social
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs up and running over the next 18 to
24 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who want to have access to
a plant have access to a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who want to create new
novel products and drugs out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules that come from the plant are
able to do so as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can all live kumbaya happily ever
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all live happily together as we
march forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on the precipice of a really
exciting time in the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, with Europe leading the
way, Australia will follow suit and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it available for people to home grow their
own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gianni, it's been great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we get to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, all goes according to plan with
your PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd look forward to having another chat
with you towards the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can give each other an update on
what's happening in Europe and Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, thank you very much for your
time, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Owen.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
