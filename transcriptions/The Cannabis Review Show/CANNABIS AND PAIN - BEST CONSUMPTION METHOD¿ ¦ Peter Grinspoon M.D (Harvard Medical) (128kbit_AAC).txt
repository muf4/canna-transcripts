[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the latest episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to join by this show by one
of the leading medical experts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world, Peter Grimson,
ND.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping Peter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of all the information
you've been putting out on all your
[SPEAKER_00]: different social media platforms,
LinkedIn and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the audience are going to love
the topics that we talked about in this
[SPEAKER_00]: week's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you give the audience a little bit
of a quickly a little overview of how you
[SPEAKER_00]: got into the cannabis space and where
you're at the moment in the medical world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a primary care general doctor at
Mass General Hospital, a hospital in
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach medicine at Harvard Medical
School.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my brother Danny, during his
unsuccessful fight with leukemia when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was a kid, used medical cannabis very
successfully to fight off the nausea and
[SPEAKER_01]: vomiting during chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents got it for him illegally in the
early 1970s during Richard Nixon's war on
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw firsthand how profoundly
effective it could be, at least for that
[SPEAKER_01]: medical indication, at a very early age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was sort of immune to all the
nonsense they feed doctors about how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis doesn't work as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it does work and then it could
be really effective if used properly and
[SPEAKER_01]: safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, my father was a cannabis scholar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote a book, Lester Grinspoon,
he was a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical
[SPEAKER_01]: School for his entire career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote a book called Marijuana
Reconsidered in 1971, calling for the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization of cannabis, which was very
brave considering that only 13% at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point of the American public believed in
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now about 69% of the American public
believe in legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My father's book was reviewed on the front
page of the New York Times book review and
[SPEAKER_01]: it had a profound impact on public
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm second generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My family's been fighting this crazy,
senseless war on drugs for the last 50
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I've been involved in this issue
my entire career, my entire life,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and the audience can now see why I've
been so excited to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a man with a wealth of experience and
few could match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get onto the first topic,
three topics in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get your thoughts on
cannabis and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hearing a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, quite simply, what is the best
consumption method for cannabis and pain
[SPEAKER_00]: or are there a variety for the different
pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, doctors don't usually recommend
smoking because it's not good for your
[SPEAKER_01]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and I don't love the little vape
cartridges because those have chemicals in
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a way you could take it inhalationally
is you get one of those little devices
[SPEAKER_01]: that heat it up and you just grind up the
flour and put it in a device and you
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a safer way to take it
inhalationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you burn it, you heat it up to 1100
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just incinerate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to extract the medicine, you just need
to heat it up to 400 degrees in one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's much safer for your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you deal with like an acute
flare of pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take a tincture under your
tongue, a little drop of medicinal liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: like they used to do 80 years ago before
they criminalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could take an edible as long as
you're very careful of the dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage of edibles is that they give
you long standing pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: They last for about eight hours instead of
smoking, which just lasts for a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what a lot of people do is they'll take
with chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, tens of millions of people
suffer from chronic pain is they'll take a
[SPEAKER_01]: low dose of an edible, which will give
them kind of long acting relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they have a spike in their
pain, they could take a puff off their
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer to take care of the acute,
you know, increase in their pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually like a combination of like some
kind of edible formation formulation and
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of inhaled formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, if you have lung
disease, you don't inhale with the
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be very careful of the dose
because when you take it, it doesn't kick
[SPEAKER_01]: in for an hour and a half and you have to
be careful not to take too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it take you to start low and
go slow, work with someone who knows what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you're careful about the
dose, you don't take it before driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't take it pregnant or
breastfeeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to keep it away from teenagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you follow some basic safety
guidelines, it's a fairly safe and
[SPEAKER_01]: non-toxic medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the irony is it's a lot safer than
many of the other medications that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number one part of that for all the
audience is the consumption and the dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be on point for your element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think cannabis works specifically
well with any individual type of pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it across the board, just a good
numbing agent and pain agent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think nothing works particularly
well for nerve pain, but I think cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: works as well, if not better than anything
else for nerve pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had extremely bad sciatica in
the past, for example, and I've had to use
[SPEAKER_01]: different medications for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acetaminophen takes away like 5% of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-zoroidos will take away like a
different 10% of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opiates will take away like a different
15% of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis takes away like 20,
25% of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis works better than
anything else for nerve pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, first of all, dampens the pain because
it pain receptors that respond to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in the central nervous system and in the
spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second of all, it affects a part of your
brain that interprets pain as an
[SPEAKER_01]: unpleasant sensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you still notice the pain, but it
doesn't bother you as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third of all, you feel better all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pain isn't bothering you as much,
so you can do other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fourth of all, it helps with the
anxiety about pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain and anxiety are like two sides of the
same coin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many different mechanisms by
which the cannabis helps with the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, opiates help with pain too,
but I don't think they help with nerve
[SPEAKER_01]: pain as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're so addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of life on cannabis is so
much better than it is on chronic opiate
[SPEAKER_01]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually try to start people on
cannabis before opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was a long answer to your
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say nerve pain is, and also pain
like fibromyalgia, conditions where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a bit of a big component of
anxiety and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because cannabis does many things at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just treat pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can treat pain, anxiety, and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can treat several different things at
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the pain is complex and wrapped up
in other symptoms, the cannabis happens to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of pain gets treated very well
by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, excellent, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving these answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump onto the next topic
quickly because this is something I hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a lot of articles about this,
and I'd like to call BS on a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'd like to like the science
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis breathalysers that the police
may use, do they work scientifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they work to make the companies that
make them rich, and they work to give law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement a false sense of security.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't work in terms of deterring
or detecting drug driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, people shouldn't be driving after
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as dangerous as driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're driving drunk, but it is certainly
not something people should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say someone's drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They step on the gas at a red light,
and if someone's high, they stop on a
[SPEAKER_01]: green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drive super cautiously, and it's not
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a good way to detect stoned
drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing we have right now is drug
recognition experts, but even they aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: very good at detecting stoned drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if someone's tired and sleepy with
allergies, they're going to look stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I couldn't do the sobriety test
sober because I have really bad balance
[SPEAKER_01]: where they have you walk foot by foot,
one foot in front of the other and
[SPEAKER_01]: repeating the months of the year
backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do that on my best day,
even after a couple of cups of coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the breathalysers, I haven't seen any
evidence whatsoever that they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis stays in your system for three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, they're testing people's blood
and saying if you have cannabis in your
[SPEAKER_01]: system, you're impaired, which makes no
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means you may have used cannabis
in the last three weeks, and it has no
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is someone who uses
cannabis every day as a medical patient
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a much higher level for some
kind of breathalyzer, and they won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly impaired driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not have even used it that day,
whereas someone who uses it once a month
[SPEAKER_01]: will be very impaired because you don't
have any tolerance to the effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would have the same level,
but they could be very impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a direct correlation between
what the level would show in the
[SPEAKER_01]: breathalyzer and how impaired you are at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people keep coming up with these
different gimmicks and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: ah, our breathalyzer works, but I haven't
seen a shred of evidence for any
[SPEAKER_01]: breathalyzer that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one I tweeted about recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't bother dragging them through the
mud on this show, but I looked at their
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and there just wasn't a shred of
evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at their website, and they make
it look like there's evidence,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you actually look at the studies,
it's all nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's absolutely no
breathalyzer that works right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this doesn't mean that they're not
going to, in the future, develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: breathalyzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, that would be great if they did
because, again, people shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: driving when they're impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really bad if they have something
that doesn't work that they either think
[SPEAKER_01]: works or pretend works when it doesn't
because then you're falsely accusing and
[SPEAKER_01]: falsely charging people with crimes that
they're not committing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that they're doing a huge
disservice.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people that are pushing their
breathalyzers that don't actually work,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're harming people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here, I think you'd have a large
round of applause for everybody watching
[SPEAKER_00]: this show when they see this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to jump onto the last topic,
and it's something that I remember growing
[SPEAKER_00]: up, and your parents used to literally,
I think everybody watching this within my
[SPEAKER_00]: generation would say heroin and hash was
the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were taught that they were all bad,
which is such a terrible way to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: kids about how the world actually operates
and the benefits and really harmful side
[SPEAKER_00]: of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on lying to kids
about drugs from an early age?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could talk about this for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had a program called the DARE
program where policemen would come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd tell us all about drugs,
and they'd just lie so much about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they'd make it sound as bad as
alcohol, as heroin, as methamphetamines,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then kids are smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew they were being sold a bill of
goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, a lot of the kids,
especially the smarter kids, at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: my high school and my junior high school,
I certainly had, were experimenting with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they knew from firsthand lived
experience that these people were lying to
[SPEAKER_01]: them about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, they didn't believe the
messages that they needed to hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: heroin, about opiates, about alcohol,
about other drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We threw out the whole message.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go in and you immediately lie to
teenagers, the teenagers realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're lying to them, the teenagers throw
away your whole message, you've literally
[SPEAKER_01]: at best neutralized yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The studies of the DARE drug education
program showed that they either didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any effect after billions of dollars
and wasting the time of so many high
[SPEAKER_01]: school kids and boring us to death,
or some studies show they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: increased drug use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, they've stigmatized
addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stigmatized drug users.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stigma kills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't get help.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want to help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now stigmatize people who feel bad
about getting help with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these people come in and they're
like, they really want to get help and be
[SPEAKER_01]: treated with medical cannabis,
but there's stigma because of these stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These programs have caused tons of harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no evidence they've caused any
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to tell people the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell kids how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't pretend they're not fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drugs aren't fun or marijuana,
but you say it's bad for you and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't tell them that if you take a
puff of cannabis, your legs fall off
[SPEAKER_01]: because they know that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell them the truth about it and then
you have to just tell them why it's bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like alcohol, because they're going
to figure out that if you're lying,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll figure out right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you do is you discredit yourself for
all the other messages you're telling
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge proponent of not lying to
teenagers, both on ethical grounds and on
[SPEAKER_01]: pragmatic grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever thought of the patronizing,
dishonest, harebrained, pea-brained
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy of lying to kids about marijuana
really doesn't deserve a Nobel Prize for
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliance because it just was a
spectacular failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can tell, I'm not a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd have a round of applause
again for that comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of uneducated misinformation
that can be portrayed by people in a
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly solid position of men to be
educating the younger person is baffling
[SPEAKER_00]: now as you get a little bit older and then
you realize people who may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers when you're younger are
now doing multiple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just stuck in one job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the flip side as you get
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're lying to them about the soft
stuff, they might think the hard stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't as damaging either and then you
could lead them down the path into trying
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that they shouldn't be trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas education from the get-go,
what's severe and what's not severe,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think would save a lot of addiction and
a lot of lives from the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could take a more harm reduction
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute you start selling teenagers a
bill of goods, you're just out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they not remember what it was like
to be a teenager?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put yourself back in the mind form of
a teenager.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute an adult starts blah,
blah, blah and telling you things that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't true, you just completely tune them
out or make fun of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just discount everything they're
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how they thought that
would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you treat the teenagers like people
and engage them, they'll engage you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just was a huge wasted opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to try to be honest with the people
in my life and tell them the truth about
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sugarcoat things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be really honest about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want teenagers using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be exceptions if they have
really severe cancer or a terminal disease
[SPEAKER_01]: or intractable epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, explain why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most teenagers will pay attention to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, then that's a red flag to
figure out what else is going on in their
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You treat the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't treat the drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to figure out what's gone wrong
and what they're suffering from.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole punitive war on drugs is like
completely barking up the wrong tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to figure out what people are
going through and why they're using drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: and respond in a nurturing therapeutic
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in a punitive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got to change our whole
conceptual framework about drugs as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole, not just with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that note, I couldn't thank you enough
for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to finish with one quick
yes or no answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is psilocybin a mental workout?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is psilocybin a mental workout?
[SPEAKER_01]: Psilocybin is something that's going to be
increasingly utilized in psychiatry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely something I've tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only had really good experiences,
but it's not something to be used lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people use psilocybin, they should have
someone with them who's not using
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin who can drive and who can help
them if anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can have really bad experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psilocybin helps people appreciate nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps people find themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps them connect with other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: In therapeutic settings, it helps people
with addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps people with treatment-resistant
depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps people with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has incredible medical
potential in the psychiatric world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's a mental workout
because it's doing the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing the work with psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a mental workout if you use it
therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also can be used recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will say that's a false
dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an unanswerable question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said, you couldn't have filled
me in on enough information and education
[SPEAKER_00]: in those 17 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to check out more,
go and follow Peter at Peter Under
[SPEAKER_00]: Grinspoon on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the website link there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend following this man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, thank you very much for coming on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to talk again in the future
about a myriad of other topics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me and have a great rest
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too, Woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody, for watching.
See you next time.
