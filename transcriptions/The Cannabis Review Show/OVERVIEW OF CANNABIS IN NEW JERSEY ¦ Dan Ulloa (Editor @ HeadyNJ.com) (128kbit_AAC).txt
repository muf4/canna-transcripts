[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Dan Uloa, who's the editor of
[SPEAKER_00]: Heady New Jersey and he is here to talk to
us all things about New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All is going well over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are talking the town at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of how you got into the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you're the editor of Heady NJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into this for a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something big that our governor,
Phil Murphy, said when he was running for
[SPEAKER_01]: office, he supported.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like a great industry to get
into on the ground floor and something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was very political.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved in politics for a long
time and I've been a journalist covering
[SPEAKER_01]: politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Covering cannabis politics in the industry
seemed like a great fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been some journey for you so far.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already have experience in the kind
of overview of a political system and how
[SPEAKER_00]: a process of regulation would have already
happened and you're applying those skills
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis industry in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long ago is Heady NJ set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, my business partner likes to be
called DK Nuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He set it up in 2017 when it looked like
Governor Murphy was going to win the
[SPEAKER_01]: election and that he promised that the
cannabis would be done quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it was not done quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process was a little longer than we
like, but we're still moving forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our adult use regulations were
announced and we're having the process for
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to start applying for licenses
for that soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of leads me out to the
first topic I want to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an overview of the New Jersey
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody kind of has a clear
perspective over here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everybody in America knows,
but can you maybe give how far away are
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys from selling products in the
stores?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there a full range of products already
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw something about there being a ban on
baked goods and candy edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that being enforced a part of the
regulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's one of the most difficult
things about our regulations is that while
[SPEAKER_01]: they were really good towards being
conducive to small businesses opening and
[SPEAKER_01]: people who had been really harmed by the
war on drugs, securing a cannabis license.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing is they're not going to allow
baked goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to allow a lot of the
chocolates, a lot of the gummies that
[SPEAKER_01]: people really like in the underground
market quite unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, their internal regulations,
they might be changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a year, we'll see about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have our medical cannabis
dispensaries that sell like they do have
[SPEAKER_01]: flour at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean a few concentrates and lozenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So though that we're looking at some time
next year in the first half of the year,
[SPEAKER_01]: either winter or spring, we're looking to
the official start of the W sales to
[SPEAKER_01]: begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a free for all for brands who are
selling flour now in New Jersey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the people who get in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the best locations, the best retail
stores set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how exactly would the flour be
dispensed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going through a medical facility or
is it going through a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have like our medical
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are going to be allowed to
sell adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be the ones dispensing the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to have a license
application process for more dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exclusively adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dispensaries might take a year or
two to open at least while like our
[SPEAKER_01]: medical dispensaries can start selling
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be the slowly, slowly
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't burn themselves too badly
just in case anything did go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if nothing's obviously going to go
wrong, we know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe as a political writer and
somebody who has an overview from a
[SPEAKER_00]: political background explain cannabis
control board in New Jersey?
[SPEAKER_00]: And around America, what is the criteria
made up of for these boards to be created?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it civil servants who've been working
in government a long time mixed with
[SPEAKER_00]: business folk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what exactly is the criteria for New
Jersey's cannabis control board?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have ours is the cannabis regulatory
commission in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the cannabis control boards,
but they're very similar, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in New Jersey, it's really people who
have been involved in the policy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: policy and the politics of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all political appointees,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a partisan process in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then like a lot of the people who were
appointed to our board, we have five
[SPEAKER_01]: people in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like a lot of great experience
in the policy of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people have like criticized it saying
that there's nobody in the industry on the
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's nobody who could be
influenced that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so there's a double edged sword there
that having industry people generally does
[SPEAKER_00]: help make the legislation and the overview
of the industry that a little bit clearer
[SPEAKER_00]: for the people writing the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, they don't have a
vested interest when there's nobody in
[SPEAKER_00]: there who doesn't have a toe in the
industry, per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yes, that's really the catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, like our CRC has done a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, as you were saying,
you know, slowly but surely we're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one just has to understand that pace
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you guys have a limited amount of
licenses or is it an open market system
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is no cap on the amount of
applications that can come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a certain level that
businesses will have to be set up by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you just don't get handed a
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to prove the premises exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital in the bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Board of directors have to be vetted and
all that pertinent information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's a really good question,
because we've been having like a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with like our medical cannabis cannabis,
whereby we only have 23 license dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: locations, but we only have 12 license
holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis net process has been very
elaborate with needs for like great
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really looking forward towards
the adult use where there's only one
[SPEAKER_01]: official cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thirty seven large scale cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will be the max, but that even that is
like a two year thing that ends February
[SPEAKER_01]: 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: So otherwise, there are no caps and
there's no caps on micro cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's one of the things that's
really heartening that makes me excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about our adult use market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the adult use market is
where everybody has the real excitement
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give us how long does the
process for a license take currently at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see a lot of the brands waiting
for the recreational licenses to come up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they already available for business
to apply for?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the interim regulations were released
in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nobody the request for applications
RFA process has not yet begun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is like a really good question,
like what the process is going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: like, because like our medical cannabis
license process has been very difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so few companies have been
licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really trying to change the
whole process and create like a new
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier, but it's one of those
things we're still seeing, like how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of taxation, has that been
set as they're being kicked back from the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they set a ridiculous taxation level
to products and to the industry or has
[SPEAKER_00]: they been reasonable and sensible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, we're actually reasonable
in that fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people were looking at
California and saw that they have with
[SPEAKER_01]: some say like an oppressive tax that makes
it that their gray market in California is
[SPEAKER_01]: insanely thriving because the tax is so
terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a competitive tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually better than New York in
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for that, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see the kind of brings me on to
the last topic now, the players in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the players in New Jersey being
the cookies, the players that are already
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of already established in the certain
other states that have legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see entrepreneurs in New Jersey
and New York that could take the Eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: seaboard by storm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we really here in New Jersey
want like our locals to receive the
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to create local companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of them here that
have a lot of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_01]: here, a lot of people with a lot of like
zest to like create a company,
[SPEAKER_01]: get that going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we have in our regulations
that micro licenses are favored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those in like neighborhoods that were
really impacted by the war on drugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be favored and getting a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking to really see like
companies like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we know we already have,
you know, of our 12 license holders,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 of them already multistate operators
and themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I guess like a few of the few
remaining ones might be able to get one
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ideal is really to favor small
businesses, you know, small manufacturers
[SPEAKER_01]: that make like the Giardelli's chocolate,
for example, of cannabis, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: the high end or the niche product like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the PBR?
[SPEAKER_01]: The PBR of cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something like niche,
kind of like quirky that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're looking for products like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what people are really excited
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's definitely got to be
a territorial aspect about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: where everybody's going to want to have
their own brand or their own unique
[SPEAKER_00]: product that's reflective of their
demographic and their exact territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you might love Coca-Cola,
but you'd always buy a local farmer's cola
[SPEAKER_00]: if you bought it at the market,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be like really interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like there's restrictions around
brands, because then like if you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be selling cannabis, you can't really
have a mascot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So companies are going to have to like
really be creative, I think, in the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they brand themselves and differentiate
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because arguably, like I haven't really
seen a lot of differentiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of interesting brands in our market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, and I think that's one of the
things about cannabis in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that like a lot of these brands are not
that memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say the cookies is up there,
but like who else?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that there's certain territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ireland is definitely going to be
one of them once legalisation fully comes
[SPEAKER_00]: here and we've got to grow at home laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some of the best farmers in
the world over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't doubt for a minute that there'll
be a number of strains, genetics created
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this country and a number of baked
goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And edible products, because if we're
known for two things, it's farming and
[SPEAKER_00]: good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see Europe definitely coming to
the global market when it all gets
[SPEAKER_00]: legalised over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that would be really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I always hear about Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they say like the Guinness is
different because of the waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be interesting to see what like
what unique Irish products come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what we did with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never want to hope we're going to do a
cannabis next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This now for everybody who hasn't checked
out the website, it's HettyNJ.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link is just down there below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some great articles, highly recommended,
especially if you're in the States,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be a must read for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Europe, I highly recommend
checking it out to keep you up to date
[SPEAKER_00]: with what's going on in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you excited about over the next
coming months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the next 12 to 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the big things that you're
looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it having a pre-rolled brought freshly
out of the store or is it buying some
[SPEAKER_00]: premium flour that you haven't had a
selection from yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the number one thing you're looking
forward to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like the opening of our adult use
market should be interesting and it'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to see like what products are
available because that's been an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our medical cannabis has also been,
has not been like really like high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also been like a little expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping that like eventually that
goes away and seeing like affordable
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, seeing like the different unique
strains and unique flour will be like
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting and seeing like a lot
of these like new companies like getting
[SPEAKER_01]: up and running, getting licenses will be
like really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say, you know, New Jersey can have
the second biggest market in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States after California because unlike
California, it's really easy to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: like city to city like on the East Coast
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Baltimore, Maryland,
Washington, D.C., Philadelphia,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pittsburgh, they're all pretty close,
three hour drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the weekend, in their states,
really on moving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the first mover, you know,
we could really have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the advantage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's got to be a tourism corridor
for smoking the best blaze on the East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast within the next few years,
is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that's what we're hoping here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a great plan to me,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be booking my ticket straight away if
I knew about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're nearly up at the time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't thank you enough, Dan,
for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great to chat to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we catch up again in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Year when the adult recreational
market is fully up on its legs and up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can give us an update on how
everything is going, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great talking to you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
