[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to another episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined by Nick
Pateras, who's the managing director of
[SPEAKER_01]: Materia Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping, Nick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be lots of exciting
things happening in Europe over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years, so good to hear some
inside information from one of the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: companies out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you basically want to give everybody
a little quick overview of how you got
[SPEAKER_01]: into the cannabis industry yourself and
how you found yourself in the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move into our first topic
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my personal background is actually in
the more traditional pharma space and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent most of my career actually
working for Johnson & Johnson when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: based in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I helped run some of their OTC
businesses and some of their RX businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more on the commercial strategy side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a few years there,
I was looking for something more,
[SPEAKER_00]: something probably something smaller where
I could make more of an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis space wasn't something that
I'd thought about too early, but around
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016 it started to attract my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I joined a small tech company called
Lift & Co, which was well known in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian industry for the expos that it
put on every year, attracted thousands,
[SPEAKER_00]: tens of thousands of consumers every year
to its two shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I joined as an early stage employee,
I think employee number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a great series of three years
together where we scaled the company up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a go public in the middle there
and added a few businesses to it by way of
[SPEAKER_00]: a retail training program, a data
analytics business as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then coming to the end of that time,
I felt as though I wanted to be closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was also really keen on what was
happening in the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timed well with when the material
project was being put together by DPAC and
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Garbus, the other co-founder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they asked me to join the
management team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing so, I relocated back to
London, which is my place of birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm now based in London overseeing
our European operations here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get straight into the topics
because there's a lot of things that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: love to have more than 15 minutes with you
because I think there's a lot of exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: things happening in Europe and you guys
seem to be at one of the forefronts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me the strategy that Materia
have for the cannabis industry in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is your position here in
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we've got two business units.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary one is really focused on
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the medical cannabis side,
we do processing and distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our cornerstone asset is a facility
that we have been building out in Malta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be clear, we don't do
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's a very technical skill set
to actually get agricultural operations of
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant like cannabis right, especially in
an EUGMP environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that vertical we think is
going to become increasingly more
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive as all of the sunnier,
more tropical climates actually come
[SPEAKER_00]: online too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right from the get-go, right from the
initial architecture of the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: we decided that we didn't want to do
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Malta, what we're actually doing is
processing a flower into EUGMP and
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that allows us to actually develop and
release, QP release products into the
[SPEAKER_00]: European market from outside of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the cornerstone asset we've
been working on it for about two years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite close to finalization and
licensure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we stitched that processing
ability together with our distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: asset in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about a year ago, we acquired a company
that was almost fully licensed for
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it to the final stage of licensing
and then actually have been trading in
[SPEAKER_00]: third-party products since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the two pieces that we
actually stitched together on the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was doing all my research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that acquisition last year that you
guys had in the EUGMP certification coming
[SPEAKER_01]: through in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to be things are moving in the
right direction with the right amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: energy behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next topic I want to talk about is the
mergers and acquisitions that we're having
[SPEAKER_01]: so far this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see 2021 being the year that the
consolidation happens in Europe or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: still think we're away off from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just kind of having our first
initial tease of these big deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think it's going to be the
first wave of M&A for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll see, like we've seen in the
Canadian market and to an extent in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: market, these things don't concentrate in
a single 12-month period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the first semblance of
consolidation will definitely happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe now, partly because the European
market is starting to become more
[SPEAKER_00]: understood globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunity size is being appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now when the first few players
actually start to engage in M&A activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: that really cues a lot more energy and
interest in other types of M&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we saw the Cureleaf M-Act deal
recently, I think that spawned a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of energy and excitement about what
Europe represents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's whether you're missing
your friends going to the club or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the investors missing out on big
opportunities that fear of missing out
[SPEAKER_01]: generally drives a lot of footfall towards
big deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it also reflects the general
investment thesis on just broadening an
[SPEAKER_00]: addressable market, broadening a market
that is going to, at some point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, not positing as to when,
but eventually have recreational access
[SPEAKER_00]: open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, a couple of countries are
already working on either recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: bills or recreational pilot programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a big company like Cureleaf,
which has US opening up in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's banking access or whatever in
the US and they're actually looking beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: the US, I think it's a strong signal for
what Europe actually represents as a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: other market to tap into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see basically, the better
people I've talked to, like from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bureau of Cannabis in California or the
Department of Marijuana Enforcement in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, everybody says that medical is
just a conduit for recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be where the money is
and where the best regulation can happen
[SPEAKER_01]: when it gets to that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in essence, a lot of consumers
could be paying a specific price for a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that they could have a multitude
range from when it becomes recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the model of pharmacies and the
sales through pharmacies being the model
[SPEAKER_01]: for the next few years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see that turning into
dispensaries and, let's say, independent
[SPEAKER_01]: craft growers, like with wine,
let's say you're going to have a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: strain for each country or master growers
in each country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's who owns the distribution
rights to these genetics will be the
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think any time adult use is
legalized where there's a pre-existing
[SPEAKER_00]: medical framework, there's always a clash
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it in Canada where prices and
certain products might not be available or
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be at equal levels between the
two frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, you have an interesting
position because everything is sold
[SPEAKER_00]: through pharmacies, which is not the case
in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canadian LPs who sell medically sell
directly to consumers or patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, obviously, there are medical
cannabis specific dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in Europe, everything is dispensed
through a pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what the potential is as Europe
tiptoes towards recreational access is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually governments will probably have
adult use cannabis dispensed through
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies as well to begin with,
which is the model that they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: employ in Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows them to kind of grandfather in
a legacy framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a system that raises less
eyebrows and raises less concern over
[SPEAKER_00]: diversion of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, too, of course,
to remember is recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless there's a change at the UN treaty
level, then there's never going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to have cannabis that actually flows
across national borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any adult use cannabis was going to
have to be grown and produced in country,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas medical cannabis can cross
national borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also have what's probably going to
be a bit of a patchwork of mini markets
[SPEAKER_00]: established once Europe is fully
recreational, just like you have in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, where it's basically a system
of different states with slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different frameworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell me this, one of the things that
I'm kind of predicting that being an Irish
[SPEAKER_01]: man, I like to think that the industry is
going to be the exact same as we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: heads of IBM here, heads of Facebook,
Google, everybody has their global
[SPEAKER_01]: headquarters here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand you guys are involved at the
two corporate tax rates are obviously a
[SPEAKER_01]: big influence in a company taking a
position somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Ireland could end up being the
country that services the European
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry through the service
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might not have the hugest grow
operations or the best extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, but we have a highly
intelligent young workforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the only English speaking country
left in the EU now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be a lot of
advantages to the positions of companies
[SPEAKER_01]: taken over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the decision making between Malta
and any other country?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it just a corporate tax rate,
which is a completely perfect reason to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I'd probably do myself
if I was setting up in Europe and not from
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the corporate tax rate was
obviously a part of our decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for viewers who aren't familiar as a
foreign held entity, you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce your effective corporate tax rate
down to five percent, which is a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: decline from the usual 30, 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's massive tax savings there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of that, we were also really
attracted to the way the Maltese
[SPEAKER_00]: government has been approaching the
cannabis file for the last number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the medical legislation and
subsequent regulation they implemented,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very progressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also found since coming in,
because they were obviously doing work to
[SPEAKER_00]: attract foreign investment into the
country, that they have really been as
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive and as incredible as we would
have hoped they would have been by way of
[SPEAKER_00]: addressing any questions that we have,
working through the licensing process with
[SPEAKER_00]: us, almost as a partner rather than just
as solely as a regular that shows up at
[SPEAKER_00]: the very end of the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been very happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the other piece with Malta
that's on a commercial basis, but allows
[SPEAKER_00]: us to do things that a lot of other
European countries do not, is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: processing non-EUGMP certified flour into
EUGMP certified flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really important nuance that not
many countries actually permit for right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, what that does,
it diversifies our supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have to do a full audit
process of the supplier to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still up to certain
specifications, but they don't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have been inspected and certified
by a European regulator for us to import
[SPEAKER_00]: their biomass, starting raw material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge differentiator for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of changes and distinguishes
our business model from most other
[SPEAKER_00]: operators in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been highly informative so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave you with one last thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could predict how Europe is going
to go over the next five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you see recreation within five years or
do you see a dominant pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution model within five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see most European countries enabling or
broadening the medical cannabis laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we can get to a place
where within five years the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: European bloc and the UK have full medical
access programs where any patient in need
[SPEAKER_00]: of a cannabis medicine is able to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see much movement in the next five
years on the adult use side outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments and the trials that we already
know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the Dutch are putting a system
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know Switzerland is putting a system in
place for effectively on an experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those will go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will start in the next 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll probably, while we won't
have implementation of adult use programs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next five years, I do expect that
you've got some bigger economies debating
[SPEAKER_00]: it sincerely and on the cusp of
implementing adult use, I would hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think Italy might be one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's heard the rumblings of
Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how quickly that gets through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parliament is another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you'll highlight,
Malta's government being open to capital
[SPEAKER_01]: investment coming in and having a
strategic plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: To lure that investment in is a great
model that any country or which our
[SPEAKER_01]: government would be able to be as much
foresight and intelligence as Malta seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to have had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a million for coming on the
show, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be keeping a close eye on material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everything goes brilliantly for you
this year and lots more mergers and
[SPEAKER_01]: acquisitions for you ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be back again with another episode
in a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
Oh,
