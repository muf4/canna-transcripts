[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Ruth Fisher, who's the principal at
[SPEAKER_01]: Quanta.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an economist with a passion for
understanding how components of systems
[SPEAKER_01]: work together to create outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Ruth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking forward to having a chat
with you now since we announced this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you came to set up
[SPEAKER_01]: Quanta and how you ended up touching on
the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an economist and I spent a lot of
time in, I started out doing supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: expert testimony as to damages from
infringement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was working on a lot of technology
and especially biotech and healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: industry projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I left the industry to start Quanta
because I was very interested in the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I was working with firms,
the information that I got tended to come
[SPEAKER_00]: in very piecemeal from different
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would go in and need to do certain
analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, okay, in order to
understand the environment here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this information and this
information and this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened invariably is the
companies would say, okay, for this piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of information, talk to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this information, talk to this
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that information, talk to that
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would put everything together and
get a much more comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, just a better understanding of
what was going on in the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured that if I started my own
company, I could help companies kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: piece together this information,
giving them a more complete vision of what
[SPEAKER_00]: was going on in their environment and help
them more strategically advance their
[SPEAKER_00]: projects or products or whatever it is
that they were offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how Quanta came to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to cannabis in about 2015 because
my brother was diagnosed with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: sclerosis and he was having a very
difficult time alleviating his neuropathic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of his doctors at some point said,
I think you might be able to benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but I can't give you any
guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's kind of thrown out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was excited to finally have something
new to try because he had tried
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point he realized that he was
getting some effects, but if he knew what
[SPEAKER_00]: he was doing, he would probably be getting
better effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given my background in healthcare and
market research and understanding how to
[SPEAKER_00]: gather information and put it together in
a helpful way, he turned to me and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting some results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I could get better results if I
knew what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you help me figure this out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point I came to cannabis and I
literally had zero understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the product, how it worked,
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very interesting experience for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I'm just gonna try and figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started reading everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perhaps the most complex industry
I've ever been involved with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a long time to finally kind of
understand what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very interesting to me because
there's so much information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I talk about this
regularly and everyone seems to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same problem is people who are new to
cannabis, they start trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: information and it's really hard to
understand what's going on and what to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe there's good information,
there's misinformation, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: disinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of everything out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think perhaps what helped me most to
understand the information in cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry is that you have a lot of
different people who are in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're providing information and
they're providing products and services
[SPEAKER_00]: and advice and everything from their
particular perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the traditional healthcare
industry and the traditional healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, they're very skeptical and the
early literature, everyone was very
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-cannabis and everything is focusing
on the dangers of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only more recently are they
focusing on doing research on how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have kind of the traditional
legacy people and they're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant cannabis and they're providing
a lot of really good information on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and whole plant products,
which are diametrically opposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate model that the traditional
healthcare industry are presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of casual users who some of
them have good information, some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of naysayers out there who
are trying to kind of torpedo cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: any way they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, one of the biggest lessons I've
learned in the industry is to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what perspective, what's the
background of that person who's providing
[SPEAKER_00]: the information and that will help you
kind of figure out what context to put
[SPEAKER_00]: that information in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was definitely very helpful for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so once I started understanding how
cannabis was working and I was giving the
[SPEAKER_00]: information to my brother and he was using
it and lo and behold, it was working and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was just really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to try and kind of put
together a more systematic view of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to help other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started developing a technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't end up kind of going very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, I was continuing on and
became very passionate about education and
[SPEAKER_00]: education and promoting medical cannabis
and promoting access to people who've been
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of not able to be served well by the
traditional community, which there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of those in cannabis, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, as an economist and
as someone very interested in market
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics and technologies, I've also been
looking at the industry and following its
[SPEAKER_00]: path of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, it's a highly regulated
industry and how are the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping the way that the industry is
evolving in the way that firms are
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying products, which products are
they supplying?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the prices?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of competition is out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also been really, really
fascinated by all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies in cannabis and kind of which
ones are emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of where I am right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the cannabis industry seems to be
one of the industries that everybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: their own personal point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a highly accomplished people
like yourself, especially in the economist
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things, are paramount to this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually getting some validity and being
able to cut through, shall we say,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bullshit of a lot of the stuff that
you hear in the cannabis industry around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an absolute pleasure to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on to the first topic,
which is cannabis emulsion technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of your recent publications on
[SPEAKER_01]: this technology and what it is that you
found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was reading about how beverages are
now perhaps one of the fastest growing
[SPEAKER_00]: categories, product types in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was very interesting
because all of a sudden, beverages are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the it product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, beverages have been
out there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why now are they just being becoming
successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started researching in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that what's really
important in beverages are the emulsion
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I was kind of puzzled because I
know emulsion technologies are nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of did some research there and I
discovered that emulsion technologies in
[SPEAKER_00]: general first started becoming
commercially available in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: nineteen hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were being used primarily in the
food industry, but in other industries as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's been a hundred years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, why are our cannabis
beverages only now new?
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the traditional emulsion
technologies in around the 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50, 60s, 70s, you had micro emulsion
technologies and those were an improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: and enhancement on on the earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those those did allow for very small
particle sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, well, now that's the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still, you know, 60 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it new?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you have the nano emulsion
technologies and those improved upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro emulsion technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, 20 years they've been around and
I just I kept digging and it was more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it took some I went into the patent
database and I was looking at the timing
[SPEAKER_00]: of the patents to see when the technology
started first becoming available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had the nano nanotech patents
in the late 90s started coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very baffled and it wasn't until
I was reading some some papers by
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial Sono Sono Mechanics,
I believe, is the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything became clear then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was, is you had early
technologies with so so no emulsion is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically so cannabis is is soluble in
oil, not water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you create a beverage, what you're
doing is you're taking a cannabis extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an oil based product and mixing
in a water based beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is is the cannabis
extract, the oil stuff was globbing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage and it was kind of sticking to
the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was really problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't mixing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take, you know, it didn't taste
very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis extract is very bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a big problem with it because
it's not homogeneous in the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have, say, a 10 milligram can of a
beverage and you drink half the can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting half the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cannabis, this is a big deal where
you need to be able to dose kind of in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very predictable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a classic emulsion technology,
the problem is, as I said, so the oil is
[SPEAKER_00]: globbing in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally what you want to do is you
want to break up the oil into smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces so it mixes more homogeneously in
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they couldn't get that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while what you can do is you can shake
the can very vigorously and then it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, you get a nice emulsion,
but then it very quickly separates again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what a good emulsion technology
will do, it will do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will break the cannabis globs into
very, very small particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then importantly, very importantly,
it will coat each of the each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules or the particles rather in a
substance called a surfactant or an
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by coating the small particles,
then you keep them from recoalescing or
[SPEAKER_00]: re-separating out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is these two factors being
able to create small molecule sizes and
[SPEAKER_00]: also coat them to keep them separate is
the challenge of the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the micro emulsion technologies and
the nanotech technologies both were
[SPEAKER_00]: enabling this, but not very greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the earlier technologies, what happens
is they would put the surfactant into the
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis and the beverage and it would
cause the molecules to break up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you needed a whole lot of surfactant
to do this and you needed more surfactant
[SPEAKER_00]: than the cannabis extract concentrate in
there, which in the surfactants don't
[SPEAKER_00]: taste very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get stability, but it just it
didn't taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only and this is kind of the
big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a long winded way of getting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the really big thing is only very
recently have they been able to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies that are forcing rather than
just kind of relying on the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown of the particles into small
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using a technology to force the
breakup of the cannabis oil into very
[SPEAKER_00]: small particle sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by using the technology to force the
breakup, they can now use much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much less surfactant on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you have these very,
very small particle sizes and much lower
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the two now work together and it's
creating homogeneous beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are translucent, so they don't look
gloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mixing up nicely and you're getting
very importantly in cannabis, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting not only better dosing so you can
drink half the can and get half the
[SPEAKER_00]: contents, but also you're getting improved
bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditionally in cannabis,
if you use if you ingest cannabis orally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a really, really low
bioavailability on the order of,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, five percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with these new technologies,
by decreasing the particle size,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's passing through your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting destroyed in the stomach
by the acids and it's getting absorbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: your intestines much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these technologies have only been
around for the last couple of years and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's creating a whole new areas for
beverages and other forms of edible
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products, which I think is just
going to cause explosive growth in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to feel the results quicker and
faster, I think, is the core objective of
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of these brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's no different that the most
popular brand that we know of is Cannes
[SPEAKER_01]: Drinks and they're using sources
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it seems to be that these
brands that create this emulsion
[SPEAKER_01]: technology are actually going to be some
of the main winners when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appeals to both casual users,
the whole cocktail crowd who want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis like they use alcoholic
beverages, but also by the whole medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: group who wants a rapid rate of onset,
wants to be able to do very clean dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: and have very palatable products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we finish up, what are the
things you're looking forward to seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry happen over the next 12 to 24
months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think federal legalization is going
to end up rocket boosting the industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: the technology into the next level?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just reading this morning how
they're talking about legalization by the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it's going to happen
that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so much policy politics
and there's so many groups out there who
[SPEAKER_00]: have such a strong interest against
cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to make any predictions,
but I think it's going to take longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: people hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to note there's a lot of talk
about how the industry is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: consolidate very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another area that I've been
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worry about competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we need all the little guys
out there, we need the craft cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: we need all the small businesses to
promote variety because variety in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is so important for so many
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the regulations I see have been
very problematic in that they create a
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult environment for small
businesses to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope the legislation helps protect
small businesses and creates a viable
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I really worry about is
that recreational or adult use cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to swamp medical and it's going to
squeeze it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when federal legalization
comes, they really need to have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear carve out to promote and maintain
products and services geared specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: towards medical cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are, I don't know where
regulations are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when it's going to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to come later than
people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to take longer for the
industry to settle than people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I really, really hope for is
protections for small businesses and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been highly informative chat,
isn't she?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could wish the episodes were 30 minutes
long because there's so much more we could
[SPEAKER_01]: touch on, but I couldn't agree with you
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the entrepreneurs with a
strong brand and an exact target consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to a scatter gun blanket
approach, are going to be the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are hopefully around for the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what I think could really do it
for them is by enabling direct to consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been reading also about the wine
industry and the wine industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do direct to marketing sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very important to, you know,
to to enable small wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they really need to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've explicitly prohibited it,
at least here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they really need to enable it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that would really, really help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, I'd love to talk even
further with you, but the episodes are
[SPEAKER_01]: very short and brief to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can touch base again in a
couple of months and we might have some
[SPEAKER_01]: more information to be able to chat on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for anybody who hasn't checked out
quanta.com, I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not following our LinkedIn with
Ruth on LinkedIn, again, you're missing
[SPEAKER_01]: out on some top tier knowledge and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ruth, thank you very much for taking
your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for promoting good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ruth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day and chat to everybody on
the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
