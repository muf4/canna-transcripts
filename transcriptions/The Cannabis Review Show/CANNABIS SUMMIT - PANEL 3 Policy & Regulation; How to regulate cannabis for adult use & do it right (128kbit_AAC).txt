[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just going to very briefly
introduce the panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go from over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: This gentleman is Sean Carney.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Sean, I have worked alongside.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the former director for European
Business Development for Tilray Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And along with Pavel Yuribchek,
obtained the first license, now this is
[SPEAKER_09]: before MCAP, to import a cannabis-based
medical product into Ireland.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the 1010 Tilray oral solution.
[SPEAKER_09]: I then go to Shane Morris over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane was... I always get this right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to tell me what precisely the
role was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where?
[SPEAKER_09]: With Aurora.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was a little bit of competition
when the MCAP program was first starting
[SPEAKER_09]: up between Tilray and Aurora.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, well, Shane was leading the charge
there, not just in Ireland, but in other
[SPEAKER_09]: countries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Shane won that round and got the first
official MCAP cannabis-based medical
[SPEAKER_09]: product on marks.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's enormous privilege.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's traveled from Canada to be here
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sean came in from the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_09]: John has come in from the state of Maine,
where he's now regulator in charge of
[SPEAKER_09]: policy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our very own Mike Sikorski.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was recently over in Chicago,
where he's part of this very
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting...
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I get this right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Innovation Lab?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Innovation Lab, and is the
managing director, if I've got this right,
[SPEAKER_09]: and co-founder of Trust, who are
sponsoring the streaming for this event.
[SPEAKER_09]: So without further ado, I'm going to hand
you over to the chief, as I like to call
[SPEAKER_09]: him, who many of you have had the
opportunity to meet.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been an absolute privilege for me to
work alongside Owen in getting the
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Summit up and running today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Owen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Don, for the kind words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with everything else, a team is what
normally brings an event together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two of us there have managed to
bring this event to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this discussion was about policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we know, the policy framework
across the world is nuanced in every
[SPEAKER_02]: single territory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what better way to explain to everybody
than somebody from Canadian expertise,
[SPEAKER_02]: American expertise, and European expertise
to bestow what they think is going right
[SPEAKER_02]: in policy, and what we could hopefully in
Ireland and Europe learn about designing
[SPEAKER_02]: new policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to start off with John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you basically give everybody an
overview of what is going right in
[SPEAKER_02]: America?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the main states that are doing it
correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the, let's say, top two,
three lessons that Europe can learn from
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happening over with you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an exciting panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with some esteemed colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to hear their conversation
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of talking about America,
I think it's important to talk about a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of really stark failures that exist
that set the stage or set the table for
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first big policy failure was
prohibition in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a failed policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a failed policy that the United
States exported across the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a failed policy in every country that
it touches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's created the types of policy
challenges that we're experiencing with
[SPEAKER_01]: today, whether they're policy challenges
around whether to legalize or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whether they are policy challenges
around what legalization should look like
[SPEAKER_01]: once a jurisdiction has decided to take
that step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second big policy failure in the
United States has been a failure by
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress to act on what has been an
experimentation in the individual states
[SPEAKER_01]: around medical and adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That disjuncture between federal and state
law creates numerous problems that really
[SPEAKER_01]: handcuff the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the introduction, it was noted I've
recently been appointed to take over as
[SPEAKER_01]: the chief regulator and chief enforcement
officer for cannabis, for medical and
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use cannabis in the state of Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have LICCs coming to me constantly
asking what we're going to do about
[SPEAKER_01]: banking policy, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do a damn thing about
banking policy because as a state
[SPEAKER_01]: regulator, I don't have any jurisdiction
over banking policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an inherently federal power in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that lack of banking creates a
variety of problems within the state in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of access to capital, in terms of
the ability to stabilize a business,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of picking the winners and
losers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those types of challenges,
like I said, because of differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between federal and state law,
are numerous, they're complicated,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as I noted, they're handcuffing for
state regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of what is going well within
the United States, we've taken a fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: new experiment, the legalization of
cannabis either for medical or adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: without much of a roadmap and put
together, for better or worse,
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, private industry that is
regulated, systems that have done in part
[SPEAKER_01]: the intention of those policies,
which was to deliver on cannabis demand
[SPEAKER_01]: and to deliver regulated, and in many
cases, tested product to those who want to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has not been, as I said, it's not been
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still a thriving illicit market
in the United States, particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: states that have chosen not to reform
their laws, particularly in states that
[SPEAKER_01]: have reformed their laws poorly,
or states that have not taken into account
[SPEAKER_01]: the legacy markets, the existing illicit
markets that exist within those states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, we have private industry
thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the first panel noted, this is a
multi-billion dollar industry in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States and growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that is employing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bo, you're here still, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Bo, he noted his jobs report that he
does every year, every two years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of thousands of individuals
directly employed in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States and many more
employed indirectly, the non-plant
[SPEAKER_01]: touching aspects that serve the existing
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've set up a regulatory system in the
US, individual states in the US that
[SPEAKER_01]: attempts to track and trace product so
that the phrase we would use is you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have product falling off the backs of
trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to prevent diversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is product grown in the legal market
making its way into the illicit market or
[SPEAKER_01]: inversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is product that is illicitly produced
making its way into the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are imperfect solutions that we
have, but ultimately, it's a hell of a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better than the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the illicit market, you have untested
product, you have product that's grown
[SPEAKER_01]: with pesticides, you have product that's
processed with a variety of other
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterants, and there are significant
efforts in individual states to take those
[SPEAKER_01]: steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, there's expertise being
applied to cannabis growth, production,
[SPEAKER_01]: and distribution from a regulatory
perspective that isn't there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you an example of one of these
things that we've dealt with in Maine
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty significantly, and I think in a lot
of states have as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a variety of different
pesticides that you can use in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides are rated or classed based on
how those products are going to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain pesticides that are used
on food products, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you use something on tomatoes
or apples and you wash the tomato or
[SPEAKER_01]: apple, you're probably going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pesticide that's used widely in
the illicit production of cannabis called
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Eagle 20, generally, if you eat it,
it's not going to cause a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of cases, it's used in
agriculture produced for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you combust Eagle 20, so you pack a
bowl and you light it, Eagle 20's
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct, when you burn it, is cyanide
gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have individuals who are thinking,
well, we use Eagle 20 on tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can use Eagle 20 on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lack of federal regulation around
cannabis in the United States does not
[SPEAKER_01]: allow our EPA, our Environmental
Protection Agency, which tends to regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides, to say, don't grow cannabis
with this because you can be inhaling
[SPEAKER_01]: cyanide gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that, for states,
we're able to take that type of expertise,
[SPEAKER_01]: that understanding of what happens with a
pesticide like that, and put out warnings
[SPEAKER_01]: or put out regulations to make sure that
even if you don't think that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: safe, you can at least know that legal
regulated cannabis is safer than the
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we heard a lot earlier about the
stigma around cannabis, and I'm a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: supporter of the stigmatization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stigmatization of cannabis in the
United States and around the world is
[SPEAKER_01]: steeped in racism and ethnocentrism,
in keeping down people of color and poor
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the United States and throughout
the world, and so de-stigmatizing this is
[SPEAKER_01]: critically important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, making sure that
people are managing risk when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about cannabis, understanding
what cannabis can do to their bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the United States has a long story
to history of doing all the wrong things
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to talking about cannabis,
but there's an overcorrection there
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes in cannabis industry and
advocacy, where you hear things like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is not addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be when it's used properly,
when people are using responsibly,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when it's grown and cultivated and
processed properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that no one's ever died as a
result of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably true.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever died of a cannabis overdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea of suggesting that no one's
ever died because they've used cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and operated a motor vehicle or had some
other sort of accident, two very common
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to die from the use of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We count those deaths and injuries when we
talk about alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that we are overly
de-stigmatizing cannabis in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are not willing to accept that
there are risks with it still,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there are risks with a lot of
behaviors, I think is an important part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the challenge that we have in the United
States and around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't think of cannabis as bad in
every way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't think of cannabis users as
bad people or people who are inherently
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have to recognize that
cannabis use disorder is a reality and
[SPEAKER_01]: that if we are going to have a cannabis
industry that is effective and effective
[SPEAKER_01]: to and protecting public health,
that we're willing to talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, we're willing to talk
about the rewards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a long way to go in the United
States to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a long way to go in a lot of
countries to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, that for me is the goal,
where we can think about a cannabis user
[SPEAKER_01]: as just a regular individual who likes to
use responsibly and enjoy on the weekends
[SPEAKER_01]: or in the evenings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that also there are some health
concerns for individuals who overindulge,
[SPEAKER_01]: either in an acute way or in a chronic
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it makes it exciting
because we have a lot, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the United States so far has
at least laid a groundwork toward working
[SPEAKER_01]: toward those types of goals and those
types of achievements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next to you, Shane, you've got a
wealth of experience, your own very
[SPEAKER_02]: successful consulting firm in Canada and
have been around since pretty much the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry started.
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously know Canada has their issues
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a comparison for USA versus
Canada, which is better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is same question for John, is there
anything we can take from the Canadian
[SPEAKER_02]: market to see what we can utilize in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: A very long and boring thesis from a
policy perspective on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But look, from my vantage point,
I work for a federal government or for the
[SPEAKER_08]: Queen in Canada for maybe 16 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I did start up cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we were all shocked for in
Canada and the number one key difference,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, between the US and Canadian
systems is that in Canada, it's a federal
[SPEAKER_08]: effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 100% federal government, parliament,
the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result, you get a very coherent
policy platform to be able to move forward
[SPEAKER_08]: as opposed to in the US, you've got MSO
state by state.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a patchwork.
[SPEAKER_08]: The beautiful thing about Canada,
the way they did it, and I've got lots to
[SPEAKER_08]: say about the bad side of things,
is that at least they've been able to come
[SPEAKER_08]: from a federal perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a national coast to coast to coast
approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: The banking system, you don't have to say
the impact because it's federally
[SPEAKER_08]: approved.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's listings on a stock exchange.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that has a huge impact for
stigmatization across a value chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not just the users where stigma
has been used in social issues,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's all the way across.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me being able to come home to Dublin
and tell my mother that I'm working in
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis and I sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably the Irish person who sold
most legal cannabis on the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And her not to vanish me and never talk to
me again, because that's stigma.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, I think, the number one key
element is that federal piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get into a bit more detail as we
speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to speak for too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second thing, I think, from a Canadian
perspective, that's really good,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's linked to the first one,
is the export side of things on the
[SPEAKER_08]: medical side.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the opportunity to have those
exports leads to a really key component
[SPEAKER_08]: that I know a lot of the Canadians really
take as something quite serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the ability in Canada to go across
the world and explain our system and be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to talk and export.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's Canadian products coming into
Germany, Australia, France.
[SPEAKER_08]: So people are hungry to hear about the
products, how they're produced.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of my favorite things is when I
come to jurisdictions and I say,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the most boring person in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally am one of the most boring.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not your typical cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to come to Dublin and sit with
officials and say, look, I can show you
[SPEAKER_08]: what the solution looks like from a
federal regulated perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not horrendous.
[SPEAKER_08]: The sky's not going to fall.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done it and we're exporting into
your jurisdiction as a result.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is a huge positive from both the
product and from the stigma perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we did wrong, and I'll move very
quickly through this because I've got a
[SPEAKER_08]: long list.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Canadian system was very quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: My company's approach at the time was,
we're going to do medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a small percentage,
literally overnight.
[SPEAKER_08]: And knowing you, and I work in the bowels
of Ottawa, which is the Washington DC of
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a surprise that it ended up in an
election mandate, election promise for the
[SPEAKER_08]: current government, the Trudeau
government.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were like, oh yeah, that's just not
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know very well the bureaucrats that
had to turn that election promise into a
[SPEAKER_08]: federally regulated industry that now
worth today, $4.2 billion in retail sales
[SPEAKER_08]: on recreation only.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was tears, there was cries.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did amazing work.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as a result, there's lots of errors.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: The regulations are inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're now trying to patchwork and fix
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a review of the Cannabis Act.
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD got left behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's completely differently managed in
Canada and the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically managed in the same way as
THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: People often forget Ontario, which is the
biggest state province in Canada,
[SPEAKER_08]: has a very strange relationship with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: Up to very recently, there was only
alcohol storage you could go to,
[SPEAKER_08]: ruined by the province, ruined by the
state.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a very white Anglo-Saxon Protestant
approach to alcohol, is all I could say.
[SPEAKER_08]: So unfortunately, they took that model and
they really applied in several provinces
[SPEAKER_08]: across Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: That same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Quebec now, you're being run by
stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened in Ontario, which is
basically half the market, is that there
[SPEAKER_08]: was a last minute change where the
province said, no, we're not going to run
[SPEAKER_08]: the stores because the Conservatives came
in and wanted to be pro-business.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a real big problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a result, people are still going to the
black market.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can go on and on and on,
but I won't.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the point is a lot to be learned
from a lot of jurisdictions from where
[SPEAKER_08]: others are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm quite happy to talk about my
mistakes, everyone's mistakes in the
[SPEAKER_08]: system, something no one else repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick one for the both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the American unregulated
model or the Canadian regulated model is
[SPEAKER_02]: better for an entrepreneur?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it seem to me that the Canadian model
allows for more dominance by a bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: player and America allows for more
entrepreneurs to pop up in different
[SPEAKER_02]: states?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how do you see that?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's different types of entrepreneurs,
I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, I'm a hardcore warning policy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a policy guy who does regulatory
policy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to have a predictable regulatory
system that everyone knows, that it's been
[SPEAKER_08]: applied equally across the board,
that you try to understand that that's
[SPEAKER_08]: number one for any business, whether it's
telecommunications, whether it's pharma,
[SPEAKER_08]: whether it's food and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Having a predictable regulatory system by
a competent authority across the
[SPEAKER_08]: jurisdiction is huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would argue that's a real strong
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a lot of US operations.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a certain type of entrepreneur,
it could be very profitable.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is quite a bit that falls off box of
trucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen some interesting situations.
[SPEAKER_08]: The case of microbutanol and pesticide
management is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think personally, I prefer the
Canadian model as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_08]: But add to that with the stock exchange
listing possibilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'll say is that in the US,
there are some... I'm not going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: the bait and say one is better than the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'll say, in the US, I agree,
it depends on the type of business that
[SPEAKER_01]: you are, about whether you're going to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you are operating within one
state, you can be a small business and be
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonably successful if you're managing
your business well and you're well
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not having banking presents a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some states, regulations change very
quickly and very frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're not an agile business,
that makes it more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I will say is in a lot of states,
if you're not used to operating in a
[SPEAKER_01]: highly regulated market or you don't have
the resources to hire the appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance and regulatory staff,
you are going to likely be left behind or
[SPEAKER_01]: face a business environment that's
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a large multi-state operator,
you're going to have those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals working for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows you to navigate the
patchwork that is the American cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability to understand that when
you're operating in Maine, if you drive a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of hours down the road to
Massachusetts, you are likely operating in
[SPEAKER_01]: a very different regulatory environment
with a variety of different rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you drive 30 minutes down the road
from there and you end up in Rhode Island,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an even different version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rhode Island is just getting off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the latest state to legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you think about what those
regulatory changes will be like over the
[SPEAKER_01]: coming years as they get up and running,
that's going to be very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a small guy trying to operate in
a couple of states, it's costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding compliance and regulation is
costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what type of business you
are, you can be very successful in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some people, they just end up
fighting off way more than they can chew
[SPEAKER_01]: because either they're really good at
growing cannabis and really bad at
[SPEAKER_01]: business or they're really good at
business and they're really bad at growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and they don't know what they
don't know and they don't or can't staff
[SPEAKER_01]: up accordingly based on what they don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Joan Shane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sean, at the end, you have a wealth of
experience bringing products into the
[SPEAKER_02]: European market and have dealt with a
number of countries policy and legal
[SPEAKER_02]: framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your experience getting these
products listed in Europe and what was the
[SPEAKER_02]: pushback from governmental forces or was
it a more amenable from them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Owen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks, everybody, for the time and
the opportunity to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great forum and a lot of good
ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So generally, the kind of it's what I will
speak about on this question, just medical
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and access.
[SPEAKER_06]: The general kind of position in state
administration is I think like in any
[SPEAKER_06]: other industry, they don't wanna do
something that's new.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't wanna do something that they
don't know and they're gonna have to learn
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're gonna have to do extra work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's generally, you have to
understand that as the baseline.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there was a general
[SPEAKER_06]: unwillingness to devote time.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, this is a professional time and it
requires the stakeholders to actually in
[SPEAKER_06]: their free time get educated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is something that there's no
way around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what worked and I believe it will work
continuing going forward even in other
[SPEAKER_06]: models is cooperation with the state
administration and just kind of treating
[SPEAKER_06]: them like humans, that they have feelings
and that they have some misconceptions or
[SPEAKER_06]: they might understand something
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to kind of align on a few
baseline points.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you reach that point,
then you can start making progress.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in my experience, it took in most
countries just to reach a point where
[SPEAKER_06]: they're starting to be cooperative.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took several years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once we finally could start
getting products into countries,
[SPEAKER_06]: because we've let's say demonstrated on
the regulatory technical level that this
[SPEAKER_06]: is compliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not doing anything out of bounds
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then state administration starts coming on
board.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then because it's the whole medical
realm here, it's the prescribers in Europe
[SPEAKER_06]: are really against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's just no other way to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a pity, but that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it and also pushing like herbal
cannabis into the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_06]: framework.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of unfortunate because it's
preventing a lot of people who could
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit from like therapeutic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they used to call it in Italy
in the past, therapeutic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means using just herbal cannabis
without direct supervision for your
[SPEAKER_06]: doctor, maybe just generally checking in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has a lot of benefits for a lot
of people, but it's not encouraged.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everything's being pushed in this
pharmaceutical route, which for the
[SPEAKER_06]: general population, it's not going to be
that helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for people with specific indications,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pediatric epilepsy here in Ireland,
that's something everyone's familiar with,
[SPEAKER_06]: those stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's really good in palliative
care, end of life situations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabinoids are really effective and
helpful, and they bring people dignity.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is actually, these are like niche
markets within the overall health care
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so where we are now is there's a lot
of medical access theoretically around
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe or even globally now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the actual patient access is still
really limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's mostly because of the doctors
and because also they aren't educated and
[SPEAKER_06]: they have enough on their plate already
and to get educated in a whole new realm
[SPEAKER_06]: in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doctors don't even know that this exists
quite often, which is a terrible pity
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's really critical to our
overall functioning as mammals.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to work with people,
take our time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think going forward as regards
medical, I think it will be helpful if we
[SPEAKER_06]: can distinguish between people who have
really specific needs, that need really
[SPEAKER_06]: specific formulations with really specific
dosage forms, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_06]: make it available to them without all
these hurdles to jump through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people who have more general
conditions, which can be helped by
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, if we can kind of not lump them
all into one bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more like breaking up the medical
sphere into two or three or four different
[SPEAKER_02]: patient categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike, what is Europe doing correctly in
terms of we've heard about flora cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: falling off the back of trucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys at the rest of Europe
doing to ensure that we've got a fully
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated industry across the European
Union that we can make sure we don't make
[SPEAKER_02]: go through some of the pitfalls that we've
seen our neighbors go through?
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I think that thank you very much
for inviting us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are coming from a technology and
trace ability perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I think that technology is the way
to kind of actually remove that problems
[SPEAKER_03]: with access, building the confidence of
doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like focusing on quality,
actually proving that the source
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance of quality is there for the
product and treating it as a medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: not an alternative medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's from the medical point
of view, from forming of the trucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, like before with the traceability in
states, we were focusing a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, they were, because we are in Europe,
but what we can learn, the lot of focus
[SPEAKER_03]: with traceability was around the version.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of focus should be
starting to be on the quality with the
[SPEAKER_03]: traceability.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we should go down and look if the
product is legal, if the product is
[SPEAKER_03]: produced to the certain compliance
standards, but also trace the quality of
[SPEAKER_03]: that product from the production to the
patient or to the customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that's the biggest
challenge being in states for the last
[SPEAKER_03]: week and listening to other entrepreneurs
and people who are working in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, not specifically producers only,
but also people who are providing
[SPEAKER_03]: cancillary services, technology to those
producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at the biggest challenge with
business efficiencies that grows the
[SPEAKER_03]: market is the fact that first of all,
they don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know how to use the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know how to utilize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The data is not uniformed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of that impacts the quality of the
product that ends on the customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of that here in Europe,
impacts the quality of product that ends
[SPEAKER_03]: at the patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because today, our legislative framework
is about the patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about recreational yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But through that patient access,
through creating, removing the stigma from
[SPEAKER_03]: the doctors and the patients, through
technology, through traceability,
[SPEAKER_03]: through proving the quality compliance and
the source, we can provide removing more
[SPEAKER_03]: stigma and move into the recreational
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that recreational market,
the technology will be even more important
[SPEAKER_03]: because we need to look at more things,
OK, that legality of the product,
[SPEAKER_03]: the diversion, which is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at one point, we need to remember,
in Europe, we're looking at the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: framework of, for example, homegrown.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge impact on quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what are we going to do with the
excess of homegrown products?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we going to improve the quality of
homegrown products?
[SPEAKER_03]: All those things impact the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: In all those things, the technology can
actually improve the confidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both the legislators, but also the access
and the quality that is being concerned of
[SPEAKER_03]: the products.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be remiss, John, if I didn't ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot of movement on Prague and
Czech Republic being, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: in unison with Germany about design and
policy and legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Germany and the Czech
Republic are going to end up coming to the
[SPEAKER_02]: same conclusion at the same time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is Germany going to beat Czech
Republic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is Czech Republic going to beat Germany
to legislation?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they already are.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in alignment.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're working together.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're sharing drafts back and forth of
their frameworks, their concepts,
[SPEAKER_06]: their end goals.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's differences in some of the
specifics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're working, though, diligently,
I really can say, on both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And specifically in the Czech Republic,
I live in the Czech Republic, so
[SPEAKER_06]: disclosure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a unique situation happening
right now where in most countries,
[SPEAKER_06]: as we're trying to figure out what is the
role of cannabis in society, there's
[SPEAKER_06]: different groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody traditionally, in most
countries, is fighting for their own
[SPEAKER_06]: interests.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how it was in the Czech
Republic, as long as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: But recently, everybody has gotten on
board fighting for their own interests.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's really important for one
cause together to do what's right for
[SPEAKER_06]: society as a whole.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that might kind of sound
highfalutin, but it's really true.
[SPEAKER_06]: The really divergent stakeholder groups
are now coming together asking,
[SPEAKER_06]: how can we work together, synergize,
to push this over the finish line?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because really now, at least in the Czech
Republic, it's similar to what's happening
[SPEAKER_06]: in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_06]: But from a more kind of salt of the earth
approach is that the Czechs are coming
[SPEAKER_06]: together and they say, look, we want to do
something that helps people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe let me dispel one myth that Czechs
are all crazy stoners.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just very normal people like you
and me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're kind of pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been at the crossroads of Europe
for history.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've had everything forced down
their throat from religion and politics
[SPEAKER_06]: and the different systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've reached this kind of point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think their national identity that
they're going to make a decision based on
[SPEAKER_06]: their own direct experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that is is that cannabis,
it needs to be controlled.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has risks.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, it has benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when used responsibly, if there's
education and fair information,
[SPEAKER_06]: then it can be a normal, healthy part of
your kind of social cohesion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something that is abstract.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the Czechs versus the Germans,
I don't want to play, say, one or the
[SPEAKER_06]: other because they're generally moving in
lockstep, which is really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's it shows that there is this
potential for kind of a European solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: And historically, the Czechs and Germans
did this about 150 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people don't know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the in the world of brewing,
the lager beer or pills, whatever you want
[SPEAKER_06]: to call it, there was many people in the
1800s brewing beers and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_06]: out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Bohemians were great and the
Bavarians were great.
[SPEAKER_06]: But and then what happened was the
Bavarians and the Bohemians, it's like the
[SPEAKER_06]: Czechs and Germans, they came together in
the city of Pilsen and they created what
[SPEAKER_06]: was at the time unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a brewery in which there was Czech
speakers and German speakers working
[SPEAKER_06]: together to come with up with the right
recipe for the best product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the result was Pilsner Urquell,
which is now the it's like the the best
[SPEAKER_06]: beer in the world, frankly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now what the Germans and Czechs are
doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for you that work away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that was a really great
point that was made about these sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: divisions and then putting divisions aside
to come together to advance a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has happened repeatedly in the
American context, at least the problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: not so much the coming together and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's true in our politics
generally, but certainly in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so early on in the cannabis fight,
especially around adult use, there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people coming together and speaking
in a similar voice and having some wins in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and Washington early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very shortly thereafter, the fissures
within the movement really emerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you had groups of people who knew
that who knew that their approach was the
[SPEAKER_01]: right approach and that their approach was
the only approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that created some real challenges
within the movement and also some failures
[SPEAKER_01]: within the movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw some ballot initiatives fail
because multiple groups were trying to put
[SPEAKER_01]: initiatives on ballots in states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when one got on and the other didn't,
they opposed the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so infighting has really held back
cannabis reform in the United States and
[SPEAKER_01]: so and certainly around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about the broader
perspective, if you're a cannabis reform
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate, your question should not be is
my idea better than that other cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: reform advocate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your perspective should be are our ideas
better than prohibitionists' ideas?
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you approach it from that
perspective, you're gonna keep screwing
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you are in that fight,
especially the initial fight, once you
[SPEAKER_01]: pass legalization and you're in regulatory
fights, you're gonna have that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: mudslinging and in the trenches kind of
bitter fights over very small parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the broader question,
the biggest threat to cannabis advocates
[SPEAKER_01]: is oftentimes other cannabis advocates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being able to put those differences
down, whether it's within a country or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's across countries trying to
fight for the same thing, taking that deep
[SPEAKER_01]: breath, understanding that the other
cannabis advocate with a different idea
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't your enemy, but just a friend with a
different perspective is the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: move through those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen far too often on people
groups shoot themselves in the foot
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're too proud to compromise or
they're too proud to understand that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: the small parts that they're fighting for
is not worth throwing the entire battle
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Ashneen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just want to add two quick things
to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, in relation to the split,
you know, in different types of medical
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, I would like to go up to the
policy level and, you know, let's deal
[SPEAKER_08]: with the elephant in the room where
there's a lot of policy, a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: political fear that, oh, medical cannabis
is just a gateway to legalization and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a huge issue when you're having
conversations around trying to move the
[SPEAKER_08]: needle in a jurisdiction on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking the concept of splitting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that you can see from the
Canadian regulations, they've actually got
[SPEAKER_08]: a segment in their regulations that talk
about products, called a section called
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis with drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you stand back and go, hang on a
minute, what's that even mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what it means is cannabis has seen
something different than what a
[SPEAKER_08]: traditional FDA drug is, right,
an approved drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's actually a third way in the
Canadian regulations to say, OK,
[SPEAKER_08]: we predict that in the future there will
be medical cannabis, there will always be
[SPEAKER_08]: medical cannabis, the utility.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's more than likely going to be a
combination of formulations with different
[SPEAKER_08]: already existing drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, whether it's CBN and
melatonin, whether it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a way to protect that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's very important that we
protect the medical piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second element that I'd like to touch
on is 100% on, you know, your advocates
[SPEAKER_08]: shoulder to shoulder should be shoulder to
shoulder.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Canada, we saw this through,
well, you're only a business guy or you're
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ex government.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't understand the fight that I've
had for 40 years with, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to my civil rights and smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we need to work together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, some of the companies
actually the companies that did really
[SPEAKER_08]: well is for those who actually brought
together people who were hardcore and
[SPEAKER_08]: campaigns that did really well brought
people together who were hardcore,
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say traditional legacy advocates
that, you know, went back 40 years and
[SPEAKER_08]: combine it with those who understood this,
you know, modern lobbying, business
[SPEAKER_08]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly, you know, the company,
one of the companies I worked with,
[SPEAKER_08]: I work shoulder and shoulder in,
you know, every day with a guy who his
[SPEAKER_08]: last paycheck before he works.
[SPEAKER_08]: And before we took him from the gray
market into the white market was he was
[SPEAKER_08]: paid from a bag that fell from a
helicopter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So but now he's paid in a proper job and a
proper working.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a fantastic guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a real honor to be able to
learn from him.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there's a lot to be done both
on the split and making sure we don't in
[SPEAKER_08]: fight for either the medical or direct
campaign that's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for somewhere like Ireland,
let's say we have an archaic medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis program at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: What in your two experiences?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what was the catalyst for the
legalization or a full medical program
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in America and Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it lobbying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it consulting firms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a mixture, as you said,
or a combination of everything?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so really quick on medical in
Canada, it was the crown losing court case
[SPEAKER_08]: after court case after court case.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, the Canadian government is
terrible losing two types of court cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one is indigenous court cases,
because unlike the U.S., there are very
[SPEAKER_08]: complicated indigenous affairs issues
where, you know, there was no people
[SPEAKER_08]: defeated in Canada like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're they have a whole different
bunch of rights and they, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: the crown loses all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second group were medical cannabis
access, where they were just took the
[SPEAKER_08]: government to court over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you saw you could trace back to 1998,
the first medical cannabis regime,
[SPEAKER_08]: but they were forced to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, when I went into medical
cannabis, it was a conservative
[SPEAKER_08]: government.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they actually the approach and I'm not
saying anything out of school was is that
[SPEAKER_08]: their approach was they came into
government and they someone realized that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a government run medical cannabis
supply system because they were forced to
[SPEAKER_08]: do it out of court cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: And someone said to these conservatives,
who are very pro-business making money,
[SPEAKER_08]: said, yeah, we're losing five million
dollars a year selling weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they went, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, we're going to hand this
entire program over to corporations,
[SPEAKER_08]: let them lose the five million dollars or
make five million dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: We shouldn't be growing in federal
facility supply, federal patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think to answer your question,
it's a combination of court cases and
[SPEAKER_08]: really good solutions that you can bring
to the government who have a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should never be just at the government
for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about solutions and it's all you
never just bitch at the government or
[SPEAKER_08]: officials.
[SPEAKER_08]: You always come up with solutions and
ideas and concepts and work with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a very different experience than
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also gives me an opportunity to
shamelessly plug my book, Marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: a short history that describes this in
significant detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a grassroots effort in the
United States that allowed the first
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis program in California to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a decades long fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The true catalyst was the AIDS epidemic,
the HIV AIDS crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the use of cannabis, particularly
in Los Angeles and San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_01]: to help ameliorate the side effects of
early HIV pharmaceuticals was shown to
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit communities that were oftentimes
left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gay and lesbian communities, poorer
communities during the HIV AIDS crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in those cities, in bigger cities
in California, what grew to be palliative
[SPEAKER_01]: care for dying AIDS patients,
disproportionately gay men at that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as cancer patients and other
people dealing with end of life issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: really caught fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it began as a grassroots effort
in California, there were some political
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals who sort of parachuted in
toward the end of the ballot initiative
[SPEAKER_01]: fight or during the ballot initiative
fight to get that initiative across the
[SPEAKER_01]: finish line in terms of getting the
signatures necessary to make the ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: and then ultimately to pass the initiative
on election day in 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorite bits of trivia is
California approved medical cannabis on
[SPEAKER_01]: the same night that Bill Clinton was
reelected president and cannabis beat him
[SPEAKER_01]: by several hundred thousand votes in a
state that he won't handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there, let's say, a line in the sand
that North American companies are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: see Europe as an actual viable market and
start to pump capital into the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are we still playing a waiting game and
see what happens with legislation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Germany going to be whatever
everybody's looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is, let's say, the medical program that
get launched in Spain, if that becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: very accessible, is that something that
doesn't have to bring in the North
[SPEAKER_02]: American companies from American Canada?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, first very quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the question is, are they going to
pump more money?
[SPEAKER_08]: More money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone who saw a lot of money going to
Germany, Italy and for free in France
[SPEAKER_08]: right now to supply a product.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you, it's more money.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am always hesitant to say anything about
Germany because it's, as every Irish
[SPEAKER_08]: person who's ever worked in agriculture
will tell you, and I used to work in
[SPEAKER_08]: agriculture, it's a very strange process,
the German process, to approve anything
[SPEAKER_08]: and the regulatory frameworks.
[SPEAKER_08]: All I can tell you is that in 2016,
I sat in a small kitchen with the Minister
[SPEAKER_08]: of State for Health for Germany at the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: He, back then, was super adamant that it
was going to be German produced,
[SPEAKER_08]: German developed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're seeing already, even Canada,
they don't allow imports.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly, in my perspective, whether it's
more of medical or even recreational,
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're going to have gaps in it,
but Canada had gaps as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't feel the need to import
recreational cannabis from anybody else.
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, Uruguay or elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly, I think it's going to be a
pretty close shopping.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not in behind the German border
after a while, that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a German operation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'll say is I think one of the
benefits of a nation like Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing in terms of capital from the
United States is it cuts down dramatically
[SPEAKER_01]: on uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst thing for a business and the
worst thing for an investor is significant
[SPEAKER_01]: uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of uncertainty in the United
States right now in American capital
[SPEAKER_01]: markets around cannabis and in American
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a big part of that is not whether
a state is going to reverse its decision
[SPEAKER_01]: to legalize cannabis or whether an entire
market in the United States is going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: under, but what the shock of federal
legalization is going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be states in the US
that end up being net exporter states.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be states in the US
that will be net importer states when
[SPEAKER_01]: federal legalization happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're investing in a company that has
cultivation facilities in Alaska,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to lose a lot of
money if you invest in those companies
[SPEAKER_01]: when federal legalization happens and
cheaper to be produced cannabis flows into
[SPEAKER_01]: that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of money on the
sidelines in the United States right now
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for a safer bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as Canada is an example,
American capital flowed into Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: before, during, and after legalization
happened because it was seen as a safer
[SPEAKER_01]: bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Germany and other European nations
are going to provide that type of zone of
[SPEAKER_01]: safety or zone of certainty around
cannabis that the United States just does
[SPEAKER_01]: not have right now until legalization
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now some uncertainty and some risk you'll
see investors going after, but the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of uncertainty in US markets right now is
pretty profound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Sean, Sean, you want to work away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course, work away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one small comment on this topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, where we're moving now with
cannabis policy discussions in Europe is
[SPEAKER_06]: if European competition laws are going to
apply or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's really important that we hold
firm that that's the whole basis of the
[SPEAKER_06]: common market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of these national fortresses,
I think should be really discouraged and
[SPEAKER_06]: not encouraged at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I actually wanted to jump on to our
two European experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is going to be the
catalyst in Europe?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just mentioned there they're
protecting our own businesses and our own
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you maybe both elaborate on what you
think Europe is going to be the inflection
[SPEAKER_02]: point for us?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think we're getting very close to
it now and generally amongst the general
[SPEAKER_06]: public, policymakers, essentially
everybody, it's pretty clear that
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibition doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, nobody's denying that anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know prohibition doesn't work,
so something needs to give.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is what will it be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in the dial, if I pronounce it right,
Gino Kenney has another bill for
[SPEAKER_06]: decriminalization, which is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gino Kenney, he's an Irish parliamentarian
who's fighting for his constituency.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great that he's doing something.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the decriminalization efforts fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't solve anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's being floated as plan B in Germany,
but it's a ton of waste of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't even go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Portugal decriminalized 20 years ago,
the Netherlands, the Czech Republic also,
[SPEAKER_06]: but people are still getting locked up all
the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The product is still illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do business with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one country where it makes sense,
maybe possibly France.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the United States,
decriminalization makes a lot of sense
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the racial disparities locking
up African Americans in for-profit
[SPEAKER_06]: prisons.
[SPEAKER_06]: The United States needs to decriminalize,
completely separate from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: consumption question.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Europe, so I believe that right now
we are at that moment and 2023 is really
[SPEAKER_06]: important.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Kai said this morning, we're expecting
stuff next month.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's gonna be stuff from June.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's gonna be stuff from Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's gonna be stuff from the Czech
Republic.
[SPEAKER_06]: The European Commission is coming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we really need, I believe at this
point, to say prohibition doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want kids having access to
cannabis freely being offered in schools.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's now, the new wave is all this
HHC products.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just like the new spice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if someone thinks that this is because
people don't want to get so high,
[SPEAKER_06]: I disagree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is just a loophole and people
are just using it because THC is illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're gonna get people high
through back channels through some
[SPEAKER_06]: loophole.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the easiest way, really the most
pragmatic way to solve this is to say we
[SPEAKER_06]: need to legalize cannabis so it's not
illicit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because then we can trade and then we
overcome these national champion kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: concepts.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then we need to legalize it and do
smart regulation where THC is simply
[SPEAKER_06]: accepted as something that's been with us,
it's with us, and will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can essentially do away with
all these Frankenstein creations that are
[SPEAKER_06]: just filling a gap.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're at that moment right now.
Owen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: We come to the moment, obviously that
catalyst will be possibly Germany or Czech
[SPEAKER_03]: Republic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a race, so we'll see who wins.
[SPEAKER_03]: But decriminalization doesn't work because
it cannot create a legal regulated system
[SPEAKER_03]: in which we can know exactly what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to find this, that's nice
word, Frankenstein kind of legislation
[SPEAKER_03]: framework that will not improve public
health, will not reduce harm.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are going to introduce the low
quality products into the markets and
[SPEAKER_03]: which we will cannot control.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is you ask about the
American companies coming to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a high excitement from the
technology of American companies to come
[SPEAKER_03]: to Europe, but they don't know how to move
around that market at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there is a lot of education
that needs to happen in states as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do, you get the questions in
America, can you say recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: in Europe?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that islet can play this role
that it's always played for years,
[SPEAKER_03]: so becoming that bridge between Europe and
America and United States, especially from
[SPEAKER_03]: a technology perspective, where we can
provide a bit of knowledge about Europe
[SPEAKER_03]: and on the other hand, provide to American
companies and that gateway to Europe and
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of bring that market faster so we can
remove the problems that American market
[SPEAKER_03]: had, Canadian American market had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One item I want to add to that to build on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree the point about decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: In decriminalization in the United States,
we found even still racial inequities and
[SPEAKER_01]: biases post-state decriminalization
efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the arguments that I rarely hear in
a legalization conversation that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: is something that is applicable not just
in the U.S., but in countries around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, surrounds public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people in a legalization
fight are concerned about, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to happen with public health?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there going to be drug drivers on the
roads or children going to be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: greater access to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is cannabis use disorder and mental
health issues going to be like?
[SPEAKER_01]: All valid concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what is wrong is we think
about those public health issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: A, as if they don't already exist in our
society that uses cannabis as the most
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly used illicit drug in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the comparison should not just be will
legalization have this effect or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the alternative is if we are throwing
a lot of people in jail for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's think about what the public health
consequences of jailing people is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what those public health
consequences are and they're severe,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's around recidivism,
whether it's around drug addiction,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it is around the variety of other
health outcomes that we can point to the
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals who are incarcerated and the
formerly incarcerated deal with not just
[SPEAKER_01]: during their time in prison, but over the
arch of their lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, in the legalization fights,
that needs to be the public health
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is worse, locking up in the United
States hundreds of thousands of people
[SPEAKER_01]: every year, which we still do,
and dealing with those public health
[SPEAKER_01]: crises or the public health challenges
that are represented by legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a public health argument I
don't hear made often enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that is not difficult
for the average citizen of the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States or the average citizen of countries
across the world to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows that the incarcerated and
formerly incarcerated deal with a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those two most people far outweigh the
potential public health risks of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane, you want to add a word?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree with everything you say.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the decrim piece, I think if you have
to step back and understand from a public
[SPEAKER_08]: policy, regulatory policy piece that
something what, for example, that's Geno's
[SPEAKER_08]: doing is he's trying to, there's a theory
in regulatory policy, and I could bore you
[SPEAKER_08]: all for a long time, that about opening
windows before you open doors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very rare, there's punctuated equity room,
there's chances for policy change that
[SPEAKER_08]: occur over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the best way to do it is push open a
window before you open the door.
[SPEAKER_08]: And decrim is sometimes seen as that
window.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Geno's bill is tiny, tiny,
tiny, tiny.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really small.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's smart from a political
perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the only concern I have, and it's what
my other speakers, it's great,
[SPEAKER_08]: I support it 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you could end up being a situation
where you have decrim, and then you've got
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis and it's not tracked properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no real regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no, it's a bit of a mess.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've got something.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what you actually have to do is step
back and go, okay, we need a proper,
[SPEAKER_08]: coherent regulatory policy framework,
not just decrim.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, it is atrocious that there's,
you know, 17, 18 year old kids that are
[SPEAKER_08]: going up into courts here in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, they're, you know,
they're being given life sentences for no
[SPEAKER_08]: immigration, or immigration, you know,
that no jobs, no nothing, and basically
[SPEAKER_08]: criminal, complete criminal record for
something that's so ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you have to get a vote on,
and that's the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a little bit, it's, you know,
it's, for me, it's not public health per
[SPEAKER_08]: se, but it's public social health,
because there's no, there's no reason to
[SPEAKER_08]: destroy these lives, because those lives,
once they start getting destroyed,
[SPEAKER_08]: to that degree, they can't get jobs,
and then you get unemployment,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then you're into community impact
issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada, at least Canada has shown that is,
you know, they've actually gone as far as
[SPEAKER_08]: to revoke the criminal records and to
give, you know, a whole review of that
[SPEAKER_08]: process once legalizations occurs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in New York, for example,
they've even gone as far as to,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to say it properly,
but to compensate those social segments
[SPEAKER_08]: that would have been impacted by the war
on drugs by allowing, for example,
[SPEAKER_08]: only certain people of color, I think,
to get their first licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know for regulatory policy,
that's a bit of nightmare, but it shows
[SPEAKER_08]: the intent is the right intent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the conversation that we have
to have.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether you're left-wing, Gino,
or, you know, Luke, or Eddie, you're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to have to have those conversations with
the hardcore, finigale, phenofalers on the
[SPEAKER_08]: other side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those conversations are happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's up to us to,
as activists, to facilitate that cross
[SPEAKER_08]: party conversation that so when it does go
to vote, when it does it, that everyone,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's no risk for anybody anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're giving them, it's a win,
win, win for everybody in the stakeholder
[SPEAKER_08]: network and the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Shane.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to open up to questions down
in a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one thing I wanted to finish on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we all agree that Europe is going to
have a stronger pharmaceutical market than
[SPEAKER_02]: it is going to have an adult use market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just with the infrastructure that's
already here and the potential for OEP in
[SPEAKER_02]: that industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: For time being, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like for time being, you have that,
that's the only framework we exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the future, obviously the
recreational will be bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we can take from the
pharmaceutical industry, from the quality
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective and build on that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I'm not saying let's do
recreational like pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the quality elements can be in there,
you know, and just adding to the
[SPEAKER_03]: decriminalization thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like decriminalization works from that
perspective of that 17 year old not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to jail, but it creates an awful lot of
other problems, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That policy makers later on look at it and
say, oh, we made the mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only way for us is to really
regulate and really regulate it well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that technology can help with
that a lot, you know, give that confidence
[SPEAKER_03]: to the policy makers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mike, for that
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to open up to questions to
anybody who may have some for our panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get to raise your hand,
we'll go around to you with the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think about the
implementation of public tenders by the
[SPEAKER_00]: governments in order to motivate the
pharmaceutical industry to invest more in
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical research and to fight more for
sanitary registries about cannabis drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this could work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be a good strategy hand by hand
with educational campaign about teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: people, educating people about this?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as someone who was intimately involved
in tendering for Italian contracts,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm looking at my ex-collaborator,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a big fan of tenders per se.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's better ways to do it with
a grants and contributions system.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tender system, I think, you know,
unless you're building very large ships of
[SPEAKER_08]: military bases, I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pharmaceutical tendering, unless you're
supplying products into armies,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for a tendering process for something
like cannabis, really, there shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_08]: a government involved in that basic
wholesaling concept in my mind,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there's ideas about grants and
contributions, setting up research and
[SPEAKER_08]: helping them along the innovation process
for getting data for safety and for
[SPEAKER_08]: efficacy, 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: But actual tender process, I know it
happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a default way for many
governments to operate, but I haven't seen
[SPEAKER_08]: much success in the cannabis tendering
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am asking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not my personal question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a question of a representative of
the pharmaceutical industry in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was asking him a space for start
talking about medicinal cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mexico is 100% legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his question was, why you guys still
seeking and trying to push that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry invest in cannabis
drugs instead of asking the government to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the one who motivate the industry and
to ask these drugs, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like THC oil for palliative treatments in
the palliative area of the hospital?
[SPEAKER_00]: Public hospitals, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about if the government started these
kind of tenders, public tenders,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the pharmaceutical company will say,
oh, okay, there is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to invest in these in order to
be the provider for the government and the
[SPEAKER_00]: government give these access to the
cannabis for the people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So having spent the last 15 years in
Canada where we have a very robust and
[SPEAKER_08]: elderly good public health system,
the government pays for my drugs anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether I get a drug with a DIN number
or whether I get medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: once it's on the reimbursement program
from a federal and provincial perspective,
[SPEAKER_08]: it doesn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know not every jurisdiction is like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think certainly the issue here in the
pharmaceutical industry is that there's no
[SPEAKER_08]: IP protection on a lot of the cannabis
side.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like we're seeing now in psychedelics,
why the pharmaceutical companies not
[SPEAKER_08]: involved?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the patents ran out on,
for example, MDMA in 1969 and Bayer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very hard to make to justify a
pharmaceutical business case without IP
[SPEAKER_08]: protection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, you know, there's a lot in
Canada, every year, you know, there's no
[SPEAKER_08]: tendering.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just pay for the drugs anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let the wholesalers, the private
wholesalers do what they do, get into
[SPEAKER_08]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, we reimburse
the citizen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: it's good if you've got your own private
health care.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think I think it depends,
is my answer to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really depends.
[SPEAKER_08]: But personally, what I've seen work better
is the investment and innovation to
[SPEAKER_08]: support those companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who can get the data to get it listed with
the government and then whoever pays for
[SPEAKER_08]: it, whether it's government or private
health insurance.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's more preferable,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, I could not imagine
a move that would unite the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and advocacy community more
against a policy than to do something to
[SPEAKER_01]: incentivize pharmaceuticals to enter the
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: To enter this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is such an aversion to what Big
Pharma has done in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are theories, I would say some
of them conspiratorial, about the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry blocking advances
in cannabis reform, that any whisper of
[SPEAKER_01]: that by the government without first
addressing the myriad issues that exist in
[SPEAKER_01]: other parts of our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our cannabis laws would become a massive
political scandal for any government actor
[SPEAKER_01]: who tried to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only was thinking ways for trying to push
the pharmaceutical industry in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: give us access.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only an idea of this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a comment I want to share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mariana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else got any questions for our
steam panel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Rob Leonard.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been researching industrial hemp,
and I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Ireland actually has one of the oldest
hemp sectors in the EU, and people have
[SPEAKER_10]: been growing it for decades.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the last four years or so,
there's misunderstanding and a change of
[SPEAKER_10]: regulation around hemp and the FSAI report
in 2018, meaning that if it was containing
[SPEAKER_10]: any THC at all, it would be regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: And since then, farmers have been cut off
from support and grants and didn't receive
[SPEAKER_10]: COVID support unless they were selling
purely to pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the amount of farmers with getting
licenses to grow has been really set back
[SPEAKER_10]: in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And although since then, at an EU and a UN
level, it's been clarified that growing is
[SPEAKER_10]: completely legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's still a big gap in the market to
revitalize the industry and process it in
[SPEAKER_10]: Ireland.
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we help the government to take on
the EU legislation and really get a better
[SPEAKER_10]: understanding to help grow the market in
Ireland for industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_08]: Full transparency, I had lunch yesterday
with the FSAI guy who is the main guy on
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know for years and years ago,
because we used to work together on a
[SPEAKER_08]: different stigmatized plant issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to be the GMO guy in Ireland,
so genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_08]: And anyway, if you remember back late 90s,
early 2000s, it was a big issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the FSAI were heavily involved.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the same individual is now working.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not dealing with the GMO issue,
he's dealing with the CBD issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all I can say in that front is that I
think your problem lies with the
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Health and some issues
around some policy positions that they're
[SPEAKER_08]: advocating in the Department of Health,
not necessarily the FSAI.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're also sowing the value chain
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly I think some people have tried
some very smart ways around not doing
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction in Ireland and the press.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then maybe there's some more CBD
isolate mixed in after your press.
[SPEAKER_08]: The industry needs to, you're only as good
as your weakest link in an industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I certainly think that there's some
questions and some issues around that
[SPEAKER_08]: front in Ireland that make the regulator
and then the policy owner of that
[SPEAKER_08]: regulator, so the Department of Health
versus FSAI, somewhat nervous.
[SPEAKER_08]: So certainly I think there's a lot to be
done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I've seen in Ireland,
obviously, there's a lot of work coming
[SPEAKER_08]: together with two different groups of hemp
representatives that's co-op.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know they don't always see the eye
to eye.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm down to that level of understanding.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stakeholders, what I think you need to
bring together and have those realistic
[SPEAKER_08]: conversations with the hemp industry and
drag kicking and screaming FSAI and
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then your friends in Chagas and you've
got other friends in Enterprise Ireland.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've had Bored Ramona out to Canada at
one point.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have friends in the system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if that answers your
question, but you've got a bit of work to
[SPEAKER_08]: do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly you've got to keep going
hard and making sure that they understand
[SPEAKER_08]: their situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like the conversation earlier today
around the Cannavape and the court
[SPEAKER_08]: decision was fascinating for me and
shocking to hear that all at the same
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think you've got a long hike ahead of
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Early on in the US market, there wasn't
any data because it was federally illegal
[SPEAKER_04]: and there were no systems in place at the
federal level to gather data and harmonize
[SPEAKER_04]: data and the like.
[SPEAKER_04]: As regulators and operators, what data
systems are you trying to implement to
[SPEAKER_04]: standardize data so that you can make
better regulatory decisions and make
[SPEAKER_04]: better business decisions?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what efforts are you making to
standardize that data collection so that
[SPEAKER_04]: other folks in the industry and outside of
the industry can leverage that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the approaches that I've had
that drives my director of data analytics
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely crazy is to always collect more
data, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a question, should we collect
these three or four variables or should we
[SPEAKER_01]: only collect one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say collect more, even if we
don't need it later, I'd rather have it
[SPEAKER_01]: than not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the staggering things for me
has been, and not just in Maine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in states across the US where I've
worked with states or testified before
[SPEAKER_01]: legislatures, is just ultimately how
little data they end up collecting on a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of topics, whether it's on
industry, whether it's on the internal
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I took over, I instituted a policy of
collecting more internal data to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that the agency that I run is running as
efficiently and effectively as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: around compliance checks, around
licensing, around broader policy,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of standardization, in the United
States, in conjunction with Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have an organization called the
Cannabis Regulators Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: CANRA, C-A-N-N-R-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that I would encourage
individuals from any country to engage
[SPEAKER_01]: with, and I'm happy to provide contact
information for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are committees within Canada that
are working hard to address those
[SPEAKER_01]: standardization issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you noted, because it's federally
illegal, the types of standardized data
[SPEAKER_01]: collection and mandatory data reporting
that we are used to in a variety of areas
[SPEAKER_01]: of policy just don't exist in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's up to individual states to try
to work with other states to standardize
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but that's a hell of a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as a regulator in Maine,
I have a lot of things on my plate and
[SPEAKER_01]: calling the 20 other states with adult-use
cannabis, so the 37 other states with
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis, to try to get our data
aligned is just not a terribly high
[SPEAKER_01]: priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a central organization like
CANRA work on that is really effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But short of federal legalization,
we have this patchwork that just isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having worked at Brookings before and
trying to do data analysis across states,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're comparing apples and oranges,
people are collecting data differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big examples, and I'll wrap up
on this, is looking at public health and
[SPEAKER_01]: public safety and looking at the number of
cannabis-related driving under the
[SPEAKER_01]: influence charges or cannabis-involved
traffic fatalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is states tend not to collect
those data until after they legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they'll do is if there's a
fatality in a car accident, they'll test
[SPEAKER_01]: through alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if alcohol is negative, they'll do a
full drug screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something popped, whether it's
cocaine or methamphetamine or cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, if something pops, it was
previously coded as a drug-involved death,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a cannabis-involved death.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they start collecting for
cannabis specifically, and lo and behold,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a huge spike in the number of
cannabis-involved deaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not just standardizing data
within jurisdictions, but within
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions over time as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a frustration of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's definitely a frustration of
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my advice to any jurisdiction is
always, the data that you'll be interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in collecting post-legalization,
start collecting it immediately so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have that baseline and that benchmark,
and then the natural experiment of what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens when legalization happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions from Jess?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sorry, Tagers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about the data, all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like what happened in the United
States, Australia, we have a lot of data
[SPEAKER_03]: being collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a lot of data missing,
and I agree 100% if you can collect from
[SPEAKER_03]: four data points, collect four instead of
one, because more data you can start using
[SPEAKER_03]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happened in the United States is
there's data, for example, collected with
[SPEAKER_03]: metric, which is not being analyzed or
validated at all, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little about uniformity
first, but then what we actually do with
[SPEAKER_03]: the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a number of entrepreneurs,
startups, companies working with the data
[SPEAKER_03]: around metric, and it's not accessible to
regulator.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not accessible to the community,
to the industry, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the establishment of data collection
system, this one source of data,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, which is metric or biotractivity,
depending on the state, what happened is
[SPEAKER_03]: it was created without any consultation
with industry, all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was imposed on the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulator didn't listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The companies warned their tenders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that resulted in something that is
unusable by the industry at all,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that data collection is super
important, but also how those companies
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to use the data, what insights
it gives to regulators, can regulators can
[SPEAKER_03]: do actions on that data very, very
quickly, not have another company in five
[SPEAKER_03]: years' time pitching in, or 10 years' time
in California or somewhere, pitching them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can actually analyze and validate
or predict a compliance problem with that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it's sitting there for the last
five years, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we need to think about it in
Europe, how we're going to implement those
[SPEAKER_03]: data collections that drive actionable
insights as well, both for the regulators
[SPEAKER_03]: and the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, David, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just a quick question, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've talked obviously a lot about
Europe, but I'd just like to get your
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion on kind of some of the larger
markets, like obviously Asia, the Middle
[SPEAKER_05]: East, and Thailand have obviously just
went legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think once, I suppose,
some of the other Asian countries actually
[SPEAKER_05]: start to see this?
[SPEAKER_05]: The tax revenue and the export
opportunities and the job creations,
[SPEAKER_05]: do you think they'll follow suit,
or do you think they're going to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: sit in wait?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent quite a bit of time in Thailand at
one point in late 2019, working with the
[SPEAKER_08]: FDA, working through their regulatory
proposals.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the opportunities are coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that there is, and I can
only talk from a commercial perspective,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's quite a bit of nervousness in,
I would say, North American companies to
[SPEAKER_08]: try to do business in these areas,
because how do I put this politically
[SPEAKER_08]: correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: Even in North America, you have to be very
conscious of who you're doing business
[SPEAKER_08]: with, what you're doing business with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially in the US and Canada,
the government looks very carefully at who
[SPEAKER_08]: gets licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every board member, every influencer on
the company, there's a lot of security
[SPEAKER_08]: issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not worried about, for say,
diversion.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're more worried about proceeds of
crime being whitewashed through a newly
[SPEAKER_08]: legalized system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the simple answer is,
yes, they're great markets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two points on the simplicity is,
I think you're going to have to mature a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit before people get comfortable
going into that space.
[SPEAKER_08]: And second of all, I think there's just
cultural issues around trying to do
[SPEAKER_08]: business in these places that could come
back and hit you hard on your NASDAQ
[SPEAKER_08]: listing or your Toronto Stock Exchange
listing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just not worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to pick up on that, I agree with all
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an additional layer, in the US is,
are people on State Department sanctions
[SPEAKER_01]: lists?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they on State Department or Homeland
Security Department terrorist lists?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the concern about essentially
washing money in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: non-democracies, emerging democracies,
and pseudo-democracies, the financial
[SPEAKER_01]: tracking in those countries and in those
markets is just not up to what Western
[SPEAKER_01]: countries are needing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's true for institutional
investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also true for savvy investors,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing this play out in the
United States right now with Russian
[SPEAKER_01]: oligarchs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting involved in larger American
cannabis companies and probably smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: American cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's creating some real market
shocks for some individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you're an investor and you
look out at it and you say, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm investing in the United States in this
company, and this company might be having
[SPEAKER_01]: Russian oligarchs involved, I'm going to
think twice about going to a market like
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand, where I am dramatically less
certain that I know what's going on behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the curtain in those companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you very much to our panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody could give them a round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just coming to the end of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd like to thank our guests for
coming over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a 30-minute break now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody wants to get some water and
tea, we'll be back down with the final
[SPEAKER_02]: panel of the day with our main sponsors,
Richard and Shirley, Professor Dibda
[SPEAKER_02]: Waldron and Boris Moskovitz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for your hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
