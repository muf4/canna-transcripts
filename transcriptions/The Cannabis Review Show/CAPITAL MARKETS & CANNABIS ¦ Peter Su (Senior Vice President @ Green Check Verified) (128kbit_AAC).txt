[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Peter Su, who is the Senior Vice
[SPEAKER_00]: President at Green Check Verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Owen, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rainy day in New York, but I'm
excited to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's St. Patrick's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is indeed, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lovely sunny day over here for St.
Patrick's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for everybody who doesn't know who
Green Check Verified are, they provide
[SPEAKER_00]: banking solutions and expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide expert advisory services to
financial institutions established in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have brought a couple of leaders
in technology and banking to enable
[SPEAKER_00]: financial institutions to kind of bring
themselves to market in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I correct with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're software.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in the cannabis space for
the US anyway, the regulatory burden for a
[SPEAKER_01]: financial institution getting into this
space can be very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps prohibitively so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the early days, that's kind of
what lets a lot of banks jumping in and
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like any good software,
we're a force multiplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the effects are staggering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you have a manual program,
you have to dedicate for every five to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight cannabis businesses, you would have
to dedicate another body to your program
[SPEAKER_01]: versus using software.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have clients with 50, 60, 80 accounts
per FTE, per full time employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to jump straight into
the first topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's capital markets and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've wanted to talk about
because it kind of brings together a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of different topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it's the capital raises
that are happening, the M&A activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the cannabis banking sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the capital raises,
have you seen a dramatic increase in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York in the past 12 to 18 months since
they announced legalization last March?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was there already a lot of activity
happening for the last three to four
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the lieu of this known people,
this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the first thing to consider is
that the capital market or just capital in
[SPEAKER_01]: general in cannabis is probably the number
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely because the public markets are
still not available yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have certain companies that are
actually Canadian listed, so Canadian LPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at some of the MSOs
that we have here, they're essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: roll ups, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So their entire business is based on
continual M&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in New York, yeah, we've seen a lot
of people for years now that kind of laid
[SPEAKER_01]: the groundworks of what they knew was
coming, which is now a legal adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, yes, recently, of course,
that that activity has significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: ticked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have you guys seen the M&A activity
pretty heavy in New York at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are the investors kind of waiting to
see, let's see the gate opens up,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see who kind of gets the market
share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll make our purchases then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there somebody in the background as
it is kind of combining brands that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already established for the past few
years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, we don't have actual regs
out as yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically, no one can be doing any
activities as yet, except for the original
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 ROs, the Registered Organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original 10 license holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, those guys have significantly ticked
up their Columbia Care just bought a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: property out in the Hamptons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by square footage, it's the largest
cultivation site in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're clearly setting the grounds for
what's coming next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as actual capital kind of
flooding into space, that's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: happening as yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the background, a lot of that
groundwork is being laid right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, if you didn't start a year
ago, you're late to the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's definitely an industry
that you want to have your feet already in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water for the past year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think the amount of information
and the legal nuances and the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances to get up to speed with people who
are already here is going to be swift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see Columbia Care having a
dominance in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see other players that have the
equivalent size and capital to go after
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the original 10 ROs have had such a
huge leg up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have operations, already have
the contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, employment already in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, they get to keep their vertical
status versus everyone else that has to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pick a lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to interrupt you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain to everybody what the 10
ROs are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So New York State was a medical only
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they quickly added another five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're collectively referred to as the
ROs, the Registered Organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original 10 from, I guess,
2018, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those 10 organizations, which were medical
only, were given the opportunity to simply
[SPEAKER_01]: convert over into the new adult market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're guaranteed, essentially,
a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just have to apply for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, why wouldn't they,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only that, but they have a very
distinct advantage whereas everyone else
[SPEAKER_01]: that's applying for a license now needs to
pick a lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be distribution, consumption
lounges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can only have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the original ROs, the original 10
organizations, they got to keep their
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are their own supply chain,
their own distribution and outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see them being able to grow a
quality of flour that's going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to take it down within the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see something happen,
like in Canada, where the craft growers
[SPEAKER_00]: are, in essence, after eating away at the
Tilray Aurora and the big companies'
[SPEAKER_00]: shares up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I assume that they're confident,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know how to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, is it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is it craft?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other question would be,
do the consumers care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's be honest, for decades,
despite the fact that it was illegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: people have had no problem buying cannabis
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by and large, at least in New York,
we don't really have the kind of stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way the market is, you get what you
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is there a sector of the market
that will also simply carry over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just walking into a store and picking
up a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine there is that demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yes, I do think there is that
demographic that has a very specific taste
[SPEAKER_01]: of what they want and don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably not the MSO
demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think what might happen in New
York is you've got such a tourist consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: base there that it'll be the anything
goes, McDonald's type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the hippies out in
Williamsburg now aren't going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with anything that hasn't been
perfectly organically grown and fed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a huge opportunity
there for the small cultivars themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: to come to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think that for decades,
the consumers that are in, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York versus California, where craft
strains have always been a thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's much more ingrained into the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: My belief is that the northeastern
consumers are more like, you get what you
[SPEAKER_01]: get and you don't get upset kind of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of as banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, specifically that you guys are
in, you guys have created software.
[SPEAKER_00]: The partnership that you guys had with
Abrigo there in last September was a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive thing for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give everybody an overview of the
strategic importance of that deal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, in any situation where
you can leverage a good name alongside
[SPEAKER_01]: your good name, that's certainly
symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we help them as much as they help
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to the extent that they are in x
number of financial institutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're trying to offer a solution that
can run parallel to theirs, it was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a good get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from a PR perspective, of course,
was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I think we have arguably the
largest presence in the financial
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions as is today in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have just under 100 that use our
software.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to think we brought as much to
the table as they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it seems to be a mutually
beneficial partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two great companies with their
complementing technologies and talent is
[SPEAKER_00]: always a win-win for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to basically give everybody
an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your guys software works with what's
called community banks now over in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wouldn't really exist to an extent
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to give everybody the
definition between a community bank and a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a community bank is basically a
localized bank that's locally owned and
[SPEAKER_00]: the money is kept locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right in saying that versus a
commercial bank?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has a nationwide presence?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I wouldn't say it's a true
distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as if you have a license that
makes you only a community bank or you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a license that's only a commercial
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference really is how you envision
your bank doing business, the mandate that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have from your board of directors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, as a community bank, your
specific mandate is, hey, we want to bank
[SPEAKER_01]: locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to take the local businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That exists here, whether I'm in New York,
Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your mandate is, hey, we're going
to bank locally, invest locally,
[SPEAKER_01]: be owned locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what you will look for in your
clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus a commercial bank, which might have
a very broad mandate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we do residential loans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't matter whether that's
here locally or in Washington state across
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice industry to learn about
because it's the one thing we hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: the most, I think, over here is the Safe
Banking Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the biggest thing that you
guys seem to be the perfect solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for all the value about the Safe
Banking Act, the truth is, I think today,
[SPEAKER_01]: and look, it's a quickly dynamic
situation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus even a year ago, two years ago,
things have changed very quickly and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think today, where we sit,
the barrier of entry into cannabis banking
[SPEAKER_01]: is a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, there's work to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to build a policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to understand the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to show the regulators you've
done the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are works that any, whether it
be a community bank, commercial bank,
[SPEAKER_01]: credit union, they know how to do the
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just have to make the decision that
they're willing to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiring a vendor like Green Check Verified
is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very beneficial to a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I'm biased in saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's something that banks and
financial institutions know how to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know how to find a vendor that are
experts in a certain area and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: carry that forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, they just have to
make that decision to get into a very
[SPEAKER_01]: lucrative space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think if we were setting up an
industry over here in Ireland now in a
[SPEAKER_00]: week or two, one of the things I'd be
pretty adamant about is that each person
[SPEAKER_00]: applying for a license would have to have
banking solutions already in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you guys offer a solution
where it makes the politician's decision a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot easier because you're offering that,
look, we can get rid of crime or we can
[SPEAKER_00]: manage crime and fraud to a degree and all
of the other aspects that seem to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzle for people to give it the OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that the regulators,
examiners will look at a situation and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, look, you need to put some experience
on your bench.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done the homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't think you can just get out there
and bank this high risk vertical without
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, when you guys are ready,
we'd love to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our founder, Kevin Hart, his family is
from Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has roots there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can be a resource for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the movement of goods over in
Europe, it's access to the whole of Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're talking about this,
which I think the industry over here will
[SPEAKER_00]: need a unified answer to this because you
have so many different markets over here
[SPEAKER_00]: between Spain, Italy, France and Germany
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last topic I kind of want to jump on
is the race for New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were reading there the other day that
the first 100 licenses is going to people
[SPEAKER_00]: who had past criminal convictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those 100 licenses, are they basically,
they get to choose what section they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in, as I said, cultivation,
retail, consumption lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those first 100 people just get to choose
randomly from those different sectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that first 100 license, you know,
first of all, my hat's off to the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators here in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they've seen that the social
equity movement in other states have
[SPEAKER_01]: largely underwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's funny, I was talking
to Ruben McDaniel, who's one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators on the OCM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, look, you know, we're not
going to make the same mistakes that other
[SPEAKER_01]: states made.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might make new ones, but we're not
going to make the old ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these first 100 licenses for the
justice-involved applicants, that is to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you've had a Maryland want a
conviction on your record in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, the first 100 licenses will go
towards that pool of applicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is retail only.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is meant to be dispensaries only.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean there won't be other
programs, other licenses, but that what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're referring to there is specific to
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see after a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commendable to the guys in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing for the race for New York
that I'm looking about, how serious is the
[SPEAKER_00]: money that's already in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked just off our camera that
somebody like Ray Gaglio is already
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the hedge funds really starting to get
into this space now or is it still just
[SPEAKER_00]: angel investors and VCs?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is starting to tick up from an
institutional perspective, but no,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is largely smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest players, the biggest funds are
not in the space as yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, you know, the biggest
funds that we have right now would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be like the AFC Gammas,
the Chicago Atlantics of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are mostly debt funds, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are kind of lending to,
you know, existing performing players.
[SPEAKER_01]: For pure play equity, it is still hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that needs to be the holy
grail for the cannabis entrepreneur at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment is access to capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's only a matter of time
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody like New York, I think,
is just going to change the game
[SPEAKER_00]: completely when we see the industry
hopefully come to fruition at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, you know, that from a
[SPEAKER_01]: population perspective, that is a huge
dynamic shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right after these three states,
more than half of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: population will now live in a legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think New York did the
significance for Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: How New York legalization can be
underestimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's such as much as it's not too
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as close to the end of America as
Europe gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, what happens in New York
travels to Europe a hell of a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it happened to California and
Colorado, it's not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in New York now, the amount of people
that travel there, I think it's only a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of time before that infectiousness
starts to spread over this side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe we will have to phrase it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, well, you know, it's an exciting
it's an exciting time to be at the
[SPEAKER_01]: forefront of a growing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, in my lifetime, I can't think of
a scenario where you had this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to get a parrot to like
the Internet, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, it was a little different
because when the Internet came out,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's be honest, some of us didn't know
what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a brand new concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas here, you know, there's a built in
audience built into man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a matter of capturing it and
making it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best brands and the best products are
going to win the race at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing to be the record
actually go on all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been it's been great to chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can chat again towards the
end of the year when things are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to really ramp up in New York and we see
kind of brands come to the fore and
[SPEAKER_00]: premises starting to look like they're
going to be open.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to follow up again when things
really start kicking off in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please check back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will catch you on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
