[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of The
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Ungayú Bélum, who's an activist,
[SPEAKER_01]: comedian, presenter, and the MC for the
upcoming International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, mate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling pretty good about it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day is a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm free and out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the two first steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come such a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just jump straight in and a lot of
people know you from different very
[SPEAKER_01]: facets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a man of many talents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of how you came about with the Cooking on
[SPEAKER_01]: High show?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the thing that kind of
propelled you into a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: fame on a global audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global audience, indeed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got a call there like we're
looking for someone who knows a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: weed is comfortable on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was like four, four and a half
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was originally supposed to be a web
series, Cooking on High.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like chopped with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, you know, it sat around for a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden they called me up
and they said, yeah, hey, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: on Netflix in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, boom, it just blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I got homies from Brazil and
Ireland, Peru and Berlin and Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, we love you with the weed
and the cooking and the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's mostly because it's
education and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we gave out a lot of information on
that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the biggest challenge,
I think, a lot of times in this new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world is people just don't know
enough about it because all the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: has been suppressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think people underestimate,
I think, media as a conduit to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: message of this industry across that how
appealable it is to so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: disciplines and parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sometimes we feel forget
about the power of Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been on television a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been a comedian for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to do all the comedy shows back
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people notice you, people see
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Netflix has a global reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually kind of blown away by
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from four thousand Instagram
followers to seventy thousand Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: followers in like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just that was not crazy,
but it was just wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild to me to see the reach of of
the global platform that Netflix has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also did a lot of good,
I think, in helping people overcome a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of stigmas and and to learn how to cook
with weed, because you can make almost
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you want with cannabis now,
as long as there's a little fat in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was the combination of your
informed, educated nuance with the fun and
[SPEAKER_01]: constant smile, I think, is a perfect
marriage to be able to pass over
[SPEAKER_01]: information over to the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well have fun when you're
teaching people through or people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: learning things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a long line of teachers,
so don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would a KRS want to call it edutainment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're old enough to remember the
old, I don't know if they had them in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland, but we used to have a show called
Schoolhouse Rock, where they would sing
[SPEAKER_00]: songs about education and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you learn the times tables
or the history of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I was brought over here,
not to my knowledge anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, I wanted to jump on to was the
ICBC that's happening in Berlin this July.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of want to give everybody a quick
overview of it's probably the preeminent
[SPEAKER_01]: conference that happens in Europe at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The collection of people who are speaking
this year, Kai Friedrich Nerman,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacob Benedict Sons, Fleeta Solomon,
Daniel Heyman, Bob Holburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty stacked card for the two
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking forward to meeting
everybody again in Berlin this summer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, am I looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, Berlin is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite towns in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, once again, this is a scale
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we think of cannabis as a
somewhat decentralized industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your weed person that you buy
weed from if you don't live in a place
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's legal, or maybe you have a
couple dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't often think about the global
scale of cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel selling weed to Canada,
Canada selling weed to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand just decided that they're going
to hand out, it's either Thailand or
[SPEAKER_00]: Singapore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand just decided they're going to
hand out a million cannabis plants to help
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers kickstart their medical cannabis
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they going to get these plants
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they give me 5,000 plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at that, when you look at
the global scale of it, it's truly kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mind blowing seeing where the future of
the cannabis industry is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have weird feelings about the
commodification of cannabis because now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be like orange juice futures
or wheat futures or gas futures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the nature of the planet right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: More weed is always better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the day when I can go to
the weed shop and buy Moroccan hash
[SPEAKER_00]: straight from Morocco the same way I can
buy Irish whiskey or French wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it's going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the International Business
Conference, people from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just like to walk around and
try to count how many different languages
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear in the hallways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's French, German, English,
Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly mind-melting and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people from all over in all kinds
of different cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that cannabis is the
subculture of every other subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever it is that people like to do,
there's a whole other group of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: like to get high and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever see those graphs that they
have on the internet where there's three
[SPEAKER_01]: circles and there's always an intersecting
point, I think you could put any three
[SPEAKER_01]: topics on the outer reach and cannabis
would fit in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do a diagram of just about
everything for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a subset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always look for a stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this summer for July, it's the 19th
and 20th of July over in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who wants to get their
tickets, you can still obviously get some
[SPEAKER_01]: at International CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of its sections are sold
out, but highly recommend anybody who
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't been yet to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be over there interviewing
a couple of the top people and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to you and Gaio in person as you
see the days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there and I will be friendly and
not too stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find dabs in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs make me quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our timing is so good on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like with the first one, when Alex
set up the first Berlin International
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Business Conference, people were
like, why are you going to Berlin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just a few months in front of that,
Germany started a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our timing was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this one, just maybe a month ago,
a few weeks ago, Germany announced that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're fast tracking their cannabis
legalization program to legalize adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: in recreational cannabis throughout the
whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to get on the ground for
that, if you're trying to learn about how
[SPEAKER_00]: you can help with that, this is the spot
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be movers and shakers
from all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm looking forward to some
cannabis tourism when it all pops up and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing what the dispensaries have to offer
over in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can no doubt that there's going to be
some slickly designed, perfectly run
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it'll be very straight and
everything will look like a Bauhaus video.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to move on to the next topic now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've asked a good few couple of people who
would have a nuanced opinion of this who
[SPEAKER_01]: know what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one I want to know is where is
the best weed in the world from or where
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think it's from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have to represent Northern
California because that's where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we still have the most flavor and
the best varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer an outdoor, organic, sun-grown
kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor weed is cool too, but I think
California has some of the best weed farms
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern or Southern Oregon is a close
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would also like to shout out Spain
for having maybe not the most flavorful
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, but for some strange reason,
Spanish weed gets me really, really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say Spain has the strongest
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my evidence is anecdotal based on a
study of one person, me, being way too
[SPEAKER_00]: high in Spain more than once, more than
I've ever been in Amsterdam and not way
[SPEAKER_00]: too high and uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Oregon, Spain are my choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never traveled to any of the Asian
countries, so I can't speak on their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to trying to get that
Uruguay to see what's going on over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: The South American climate is meant to be
the perfect replication of the Californian
[SPEAKER_01]: climate in terms of premium product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they can grow some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the challenges and that's
one of the things you learn at the
[SPEAKER_00]: International Cannabis Business
Conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still farming, so you can't just
bring seeds that grow well in Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: take them to Uruguay or Thailand and
expect them to perform in the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: because the climate is different,
the air is different, the moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take all these factors into
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking forward to seeing
localized strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the challenges that we're
having in the cannabis industry is that
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to treat it like cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just walking in, you buy your pack
of Export A's or I don't know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys smoke in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marlboro's is universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you leave the store, but it's really
more like a beer or a microbrewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should really be super local
iterations of the cannabis plant wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke like Jägermeister in
Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke some crazy Hayes when you're
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke Dürer Franz Bratschen or
whatever they call it when you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the German name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've got such a huge European
farming industry that I think once it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes legal over here, I think you're
going to see a lot of cultivars and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of new genetics pop up that might have
brand new HVAC companies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically able to design these fully
operational indoor grows that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: fully recyclable and carbon neutral and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it'll be the battle of the
farmers then within time, which is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like when you say things like carbon
neutral and regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stress this all the time because I love
the International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also full of suits and capitalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably need a few more hippies in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to remind everybody that cannabis
started as a social justice and an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental protection measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the legalization movement started and
now that it's legal, we have to keep these
[SPEAKER_00]: things in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just be in a hurry to treat it
like anything else or to rush to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet worse when we're using a plant that
could save this entire planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just cannabis, but hemp as well,
which are kind of the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but THC levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree totally on those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll start to see a lot of that
coming to the fore over the next five to
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years, especially as I said,
if Europe starts taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of regenerative farming
happening across Europe just because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: such a massive industry over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question I just asked you there
is the best weed is from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know where the best coffee in
America is from, because I think coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabis is one of the greatest
combinations and somebody is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to capitalize on that in the industry
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed and coffee is the smart man's eight
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell that to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite drug combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those little Spanish
coffees, the cafecito or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, once again, coffee, I mean,
coffee is you get coffee from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, but the way you drink your coffee
is very, very regional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're when you're in Miami
and you're getting a little cortado or the
[SPEAKER_00]: cafe con leche or like in Barcelona,
they also drink the cortados or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm in, I mean, I hate to say
Starbucks, but I feel like Seattle in
[SPEAKER_00]: general has good coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: California has good coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I think it's the.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, me, coffee is kind of well,
I can't say coffee is coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do like a good smock room blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to do more research.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a coffee and cannabis,
you're going to California or to Spain by
[SPEAKER_01]: the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pretty much my two favorite
spaces for coffee and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: California and Spain and Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Oregon also has good coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle has good coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their weed is not the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, which pioneered the coffee and
weed model, maybe I feel like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: resting on their laurels a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of tired of amateurs and
rookies showing up and getting way too
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Dutch like to keep
everything super mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to say if you if you
stand to the bush that grows too tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets chopped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch people always like to keep
everything kind of smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think they're getting a little
tired of the tourists who don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, it's coming up to the end of the
time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been an absolute pleasure talking
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who wants to check in,
go use social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a go for 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd highly recommend checking out the
content that he puts out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who are going to the
International Cannabis Business Conference
[SPEAKER_01]: in July, we will both see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for your time,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to hanging out with you
in Berlin and trying some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic German weed that I've heard so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to it indeed, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a great day and I'll chat to you
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring the coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
