[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Kevin Jones who's the founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: HempHound based in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today Kevin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all good Owen and thank you for having
me on sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following your LinkedIn posts
and investigative journalism very closely
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's delighted to be able to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
quick overview of how you came to
[SPEAKER_00]: HempHound and your position in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off with a CBD company in 2016
called Lovebud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that didn't quite go to plan but I did
discover then that I was quite adept at
[SPEAKER_01]: finding out information, understanding
what I needed to know and understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: who I needed to ask if I didn't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually sounds a bit weird but that
led to a job at the Cannabis Trades
[SPEAKER_01]: Association where I was member point of
contact for two and a half years where I
[SPEAKER_01]: helped hundreds of companies on various
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that position came to a close at the
end of 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: CTA evolved as an entity but what they
said that they didn't want I decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: take and repackage and create effectively
the HempHound agency which is basically a
[SPEAKER_01]: signpost in an advisory service first and
foremost as well as now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delving into the world of investigative
journalism and industry commentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's very interesting with the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be one of the territories that
actually has the most disinformation if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking from the outside looking
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to be able to have some of
your expertise and clarity to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring to these topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: First topic I wanted to start off with is
CBD in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again lots of reports positive and
negative that come out at the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us an exact overview?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the CBD industry look like in the
UK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the big major retailers still
purchasing after the ruling that we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: recently based on the the quantity of THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it currently stand as you see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well Novel Foods has been a long strangled
affair in my point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been filled with vagueness and
regulatory updates have been sporadic and
[SPEAKER_01]: slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example with the ADI announcement
recently the 10mg advised daily intake
[SPEAKER_01]: that was followed by the ACMD recognition
from the Home Office in regards to control
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the very interesting things in
there is that no serving size is defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's accepted that there needs to be a
serving size for all of these products but
[SPEAKER_01]: in effect that leaves us in an interesting
scenario where we've got an advised daily
[SPEAKER_01]: intake but no serving suggestions versus
control cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoid content allowed per serving
with the Home Office saying yeah we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort out a serving but the FSA have
never thought about doing that and if we
[SPEAKER_01]: go back in time to present day it has just
been that case of kicking the can down the
[SPEAKER_01]: road in an attempt to basically strangle
the hemp and CBD industry to I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: submission.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all honesty I don't think there's
people out there that want this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: here and my fight in essence is to show
that everyone has a right to be here
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that be the small to medium sized
producers or your big boys but at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the day because of that slow strangled
effect it's pretty much the same across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are seeing companies close but we are
seeing companies who seem to be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: really well in the current climate so it's
a little bit paradoxical in that effect
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah it is kind of holding a steady
path slightly going down but we're hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically the regulatory authorities
will be a little bit more firm and
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible in their direction coming on from
here so hopefully we could be at the
[SPEAKER_01]: trough part you know and there is that
recognition that there should be a CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: industry here and hopefully the industry
the industry regulators will provide a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible route forward that benefits all
companies so yeah it is low but hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to start playing it out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we in a scenario and it seems to be in
a couple of countries where the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and cannabis industry was so new
that the parameters and the rules weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever set so it was kind of free for all
and anybody could get in and anybody could
[SPEAKER_00]: get an ingredient from anywhere in the
world and put it out to the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we just basically seeing now the grown
up part of this sector where it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated there has to be certain licenses
for ingredient suppliers whether it's CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever cannabinoid it is that
everybody now has to obey these exact
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters otherwise we're not going to be
able to comfortably allow the population
[SPEAKER_00]: to take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that kind of where we are do you think
in the UK that we're now getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage okay the bad actors or the nefarious
actors or the easy supply side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is getting crushed and the
established and the more regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale commercial operators are the
ones that are going to end up being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to thrive in this space?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like I said a mixture of
small and medium-sized companies and big
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that are doing well in the
current climate but when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation now there's always going to be
companies that are going to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: circumvent regulation in any way for
example there's wind coming out from the
[SPEAKER_01]: FSA that they're looking to target cold
press hemp producers now part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: involves the fact that people may or may
not be using CBD isolate based products
[SPEAKER_01]: misdescribed as cold press now in that
sense you would think yes something
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely does need to be tackled there
because product misrepresentation to the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer you know that's obviously a big
thing in this industry but to what point
[SPEAKER_01]: is the regulation being a little bit over
applied if I go back to 2017 for example
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first heard about novel foods I was
kind of confused because in my eyes if you
[SPEAKER_01]: had all the sensible lab reports the
cannabinoid profile the mycotoxin the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicidal herbicidal all of them you had
to your full lab reports for the finished
[SPEAKER_01]: product traceability across the board
what's wrong with your products but then
[SPEAKER_01]: your flip side is it is more required when
it comes to these ultra refined isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: based products yes I believe that is the
case but certainly with more whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: products I feel that there was sensible
legislation or direction that was
[SPEAKER_01]: available at that time but when it comes
to the isolate products and that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding being applied across the
board then of course where is that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible ground you know we are we really
looking at you know comparing CBD isolates
[SPEAKER_01]: to full spectrum products it just seems a
little bit skewed and there needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: that level ground where each product
dynamic is accurately represented without
[SPEAKER_01]: having a cloud over it that that comes
from a different dynamic if you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean kind of overshadow in the CBD content
you know the 10 mil ADI that came from lab
[SPEAKER_01]: reports for synthetic CBD and CBD isolate
so should a broad or a full spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: product be stuck at 10 milligram per day
you know it just seems a little bit wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah there there was sensible kind of
guidance I think it's got kind of over
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated now but equally from an FSA
standpoint you can kind of understand why
[SPEAKER_01]: they've applied that across the board
because it makes their life easy but it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes the industry's life a little bit
awkward so yeah it is an easy world is is
[SPEAKER_01]: there the right level of regulation or
requirements was that there before I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a little bit of a hard question to
answer because in some aspects yes in
[SPEAKER_00]: other aspects no yeah it's a very
interesting sector and as I said still
[SPEAKER_00]: lots more evolving to happen there moving
on now to a topic that I know you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of research and investigating about
is the GW pharma and the jazz
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals relationship for everybody
who doesn't know jazz pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: bought GW for six and a half billion I
think it was a number of years ago 7.2
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you found out in your course of
investigations about the proprietary
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership of certain drugs and was the
transaction actually fully completed based
[SPEAKER_01]: on what you can see it's a bit of a hard
question I know there's an investigation
[SPEAKER_01]: at the moment in the US in regards to
misrepresentation on GW pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_01]: side when they were sold to jazz so there
is a little bit of a uncertainty I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why that's not potentially
being picked up here if it's something the
[SPEAKER_01]: US authorities deem is important but when
it comes to jazz and GW I believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an agreement in place that
agreement became apparent in 1998 when the
[SPEAKER_01]: home office accepted a 22-point plan from
Dr Jeffrey Geyer co-founder of GW and that
[SPEAKER_01]: plan was to regulate and control cannabis
in the UK now is GW a separate entity
[SPEAKER_01]: still I believe it is you can trace them
through companies house if you go to jazz
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals cannabinoid page it is
labeled for GW you know there is an
[SPEAKER_01]: indication that jazz in itself aren't
happy with the way that their cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: interests have progressed and that they
are looking potentially to sell it but if
[SPEAKER_01]: they sell it what would that be would that
be GW that they're selling or would it be
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabinoid arm so there is a little
bit of uncertainty when someone says oh
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah jazz brought GW yes but in what
context did they buy to assimilate them
[SPEAKER_01]: into their business model and work on or
are they keeping them as a separate entity
[SPEAKER_01]: and why are they keeping them as a
separate entity I believe that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a public-private
partnership at play but certainly since
[SPEAKER_01]: 2021 when jazz did buy GW from that point
working up to the 30th of November last
[SPEAKER_01]: year every patent extension or new patent
assigned to Epidiolex is awarded to GW
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharma Limited or GW Research Limited and
GW Research Limited on the 30th of
[SPEAKER_01]: November changed their name to Jazz
Pharmaceuticals Research UK Limited but at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time they're owned by Jazz sorry
GW Pharmaceuticals and have been since the
[SPEAKER_01]: 6th of the 4th 2016 this is all on
companies house by the way so there is
[SPEAKER_01]: uncertainty are they carrying on you know
if the patents are in their name you know
[SPEAKER_01]: is it jazz that submitted them or is it GW
that submitted them and of course is GW
[SPEAKER_01]: still its separate entity I think it's
plain to see at the end of the day and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite understandable because in a
public-private partnership format you've
[SPEAKER_01]: used public funds and resources to create
an entity most likely with a monopoly
[SPEAKER_01]: right so at some point in that contract
there has to be a return for the public so
[SPEAKER_01]: public-private partnerships can be sold to
companies like Jazz was sold to GW sorry
[SPEAKER_01]: GW was sold to Jazz so that needs to be
kept separate to the point that it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: shown that they have achieved a certain
area where the public can start seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: return but that's unfortunate because that
agreement comes with a 22-point to
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate and control cannabis in the UK so
petitions that get set up that are you
[SPEAKER_01]: know buffed back because the government
have no interest in talking about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that's because that 22-point plan what
we're seeing in the CBD industry 16 lab
[SPEAKER_01]: reports from Epidiolex unnamed but
accounted for observers in the centre of
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicity meetings that defined
applications requirements for CBD novel
[SPEAKER_01]: foods you know they have their place and
their place is to become a world leader in
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal CBD and cannabinoid based
products so having a conversation about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis does not suit that agreement
having a large and thriving CBD industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that does not suit that agreement but at
some point that agreement will get to a
[SPEAKER_01]: point where the public sees a return and
that will be an interesting day yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely seems to be the drug discovery
and development of formulations is the
[SPEAKER_00]: holy grail for a lot of these big
companies and anything that they can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that they can protect those
long-term gains I think is what's in place
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment we're nearly at our time
here yeah sorry there is one issue there
[SPEAKER_01]: though when you when you look at it in a
pharmaceutical sense in a single molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of product okay but which we're
talking about cannabis and cannabinoids we
[SPEAKER_01]: have an endocannabinoid system so in
essence there is a fair argument to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis is a food before a medicine
now I believe that GW pharmaceuticals and
[SPEAKER_01]: jazz know that it's a food before a
medicine but what they're trying to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: clamp down on that so that their profits
are maximized when your need becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal yeah it's it's so fascinating to
watch this industry evolve and happen as
[SPEAKER_00]: as we're kind of in the tick of it and to
see all these small little splinter things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are happening outside the main kind
of consumer platform just before we go for
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who hasn't ever been to the mpound
.co.uk yet or doesn't follow Kevin on
[SPEAKER_00]: LinkedIn I highly highly recommend it one
of the best sources of investigative
[SPEAKER_00]: journalism in the UK industry for you who
are some of the other good voices in the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK that people should be following or
listening to okay the kind of consultants
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely without a doubt Stephen Oliver
and Matt Lawson excellent excellent in
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do as well as their
interpretation on how the industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving I would also say Kyle Esplin from
the Scottish hemp association he is a
[SPEAKER_01]: wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm for the
plant as a whole without a doubt he's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely someone to keep an eye on as
for other people I mean forgive me it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter who I think are awesome
really people should be keeping an eye on
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening with the trade
associations because they should be the
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal source of information right I'm of
course doing my investigative journalism
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really too certain on what they're
doing but ultimately they should be the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are relaying current information
out to the industry and I forgive me for
[SPEAKER_01]: saying it if if they're not doing it then
maybe there should be someone else about
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I think that's the case across a lot
of countries major unfortunately still
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of uh barely good enough type
of people as opposed to people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: excelling within this industry and can
understand the various perspective and
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances that are going to need to be
applied across the various sectors of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry as a whole sorry it
seems like that's going to be the case for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure yeah yeah yeah but you know there
yeah there are those people out there
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly the cancer consultants uh uh
Kyle Esplin um I would say to to an extent
[SPEAKER_01]: there is some amazing um uh academics out
there there's uh Dr Ruth Fisher as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr Jeff Cutter they are in the US and the
and in Australia respectively but they
[SPEAKER_01]: offer different windows into how the world
is evolving um admittedly those windows do
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to uh kind of show a um a repetitive
angle as it were you know anywhere that
[SPEAKER_01]: talks regulation tends to talk about it
with GW lab reports so uh you will see a
[SPEAKER_01]: little a lot of that and uh obviously
alternative takes on the way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: world is evolving yeah um I'd definitely
love to chat to you again in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months and hopefully we both
have updates on what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland and what's happening in the UK and
we can share information but for now Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you very much for your time it's
very much appreciated no great for being
[SPEAKER_00]: here thank you very much Owen not at all
until next episode everybody you you
