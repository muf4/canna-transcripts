[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Andy Yates and Peter O'Brien from
[SPEAKER_00]: Artello Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artello Biosciences is a clinical stage
company that uses cutting edge science to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve patient care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were founded in 2017 on the promise
of therapeutic development based on lipid
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling modification, including the
targeting of the receptors of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we keeping today, gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for inviting us on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to break the questions into
two different sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Andrew, I'm going to start with you
with a lot of medical questions first and
[SPEAKER_00]: foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of exactly the ambitions and aims
[SPEAKER_00]: of Artello Biosciences, please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we recognized quite a while ago that
the endocannabinoid system, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: series of lipids that the body makes,
has an influence in so many diseases and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease states within the human body that
we felt that there was a great untapped
[SPEAKER_01]: potential there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took a sort of classic
pharmaceutical or biotech approach and
[SPEAKER_01]: narrowed down on some approaches where we
could directly and indirectly affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system in a number of
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you said, we're a clinical stage
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one asset in the clinic right
now in anorexia associated with cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a synthetic cannabinoid,
which hits the receptors that we would
[SPEAKER_01]: know plant-derived cannabinoids can hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another compound which is
heading towards the clinic either late
[SPEAKER_01]: next year or early 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's targeting something called
chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a very painful condition for
cancer patients that undergo chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a molecule, again, synthetic,
which affects a protein in the body,
[SPEAKER_01]: which helps transport the endocannabinoids
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by affecting that, we can attenuate
the natural tone of the body's
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final program we have,
which is in preclinical development,
[SPEAKER_01]: is taking a cannabinoid made by the plant
called CBD or cannabidiol, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: good when you can get it into the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And work, there's plenty of clinical
studies to show its effects in a multitude
[SPEAKER_01]: of diseases, but it's not a very good
drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a very good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've done there is taken the
opportunity to combine it with another
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical substance, which sort of
turbocharges the CBD and allows it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: given orally in a sort of pill or capsule
format versus currently where you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: give it in a liquid format.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just helps it get into the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it's in the body,
it can get on and do its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for everybody to start understanding,
so if you could explain, what are the CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: and CB2 receptors for everybody,
please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of biology relies on receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I was taught receptors and the way
I still see receptors is that they are the
[SPEAKER_01]: lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, you want to either open or
close that lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to do that, you need keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CB1 receptor is a lock that is mainly
located or was originally thought to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly located in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But subsequent to that, you actually find
a lot of CB1 receptors located in organs
[SPEAKER_01]: within the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important for our lead
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CB2 receptors, again, they were
originally called the peripheral
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They occurred in areas of body that were
not associated with the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some evidence that CB2 does exist
in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we see that mainly as a body
receptor, if you wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got within our portfolio,
a molecule, if you wish, is the key and
[SPEAKER_01]: can turn that lock at both the CB1 and the
CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the compound that we're
developing currently in anorexia
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with cancer, where obviously
patients lose a lot of body weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually believe that both of those
receptors are very important in the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that we will get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see them from that drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you maybe explain what the
benefits of modulating lipid signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, cannabinoids or the
endocannabinoids that we make in our own
[SPEAKER_01]: body are a lipid molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lipid means fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're based on fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a little modification that
makes them target these CB1 and CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors that we've already talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at a very simple level, lipid
modification means that we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: alter the balance of those
endocannabinoids and get the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: effects from that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The molecule that we have, which I talked
about being used for chemo-induced
[SPEAKER_01]: peripheral neuropathy, that targets a
protein in the body called fatty acid
[SPEAKER_01]: binding protein, or FABP.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the name suggests, it moves fatty acids
around, and fatty acids are lipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we know with that molecule is that
not only does it affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid tone, which is cannabinoid
based, but it also affects other lipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lipid signaling is, I guess,
a new frontier in biology and science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people may have heard of genomics and
proteomics, which is the study of genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're looking at lipidomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lipidomics is the study of lipids
within the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can modify lipids in the cell,
then you can modify diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you mentioned that CBD is a great
molecule, but necessarily not the best
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule on its own to be able to provide
any relief for a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are blends and formulations now the key to
the medical side of the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the approaches being taken,
I guess, by some of our competitors and
[SPEAKER_01]: those that are in the, I'll call it,
unlicensed cannabinoid space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're using unlicensed medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply because at the moment there aren't
that many licensed medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a bad approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely are using formulations and
blends as their way of optimizing what the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken a different approach,
which says we believe the active molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plants, or one of the active
molecules in the plant, is CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like we've talked about before,
CBD is a fatty lipid-like molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for any one of your viewers who's ever
washed the roasting pan or the frying pan
[SPEAKER_01]: after some food, you realize, obviously,
that the fats and waters don't mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got exactly the same problem
with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take CBD and you take it into
your stomach, the first thing it hits is
[SPEAKER_01]: the stomach juices, and they are made of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't dissolve very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from then on in, you've got a bit of a
problem getting the CBD across the gut
[SPEAKER_01]: wall and into the blood and plasma where
it can do its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've done is we've formed a
co-crystal of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we've combined it with
another chemical called TMP, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: food ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it stacks the CBD in a
very orderly way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of Lego blocks here, yellow block
representing CBD, red block representing
[SPEAKER_01]: TMP, and it goes yellow, red, yellow,
red, yellow, red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, what you've done is
broken up the very fatty, non-penetrating
[SPEAKER_01]: environment of the fatty CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've given it a chance to interact
with the water in the stomach and start to
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you've dissolved CBD,
then you're on a good pathway forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that CBD into your blood, where it can
go off and do many of the different things
[SPEAKER_01]: that CBD is, from the literature,
which are known to do, such as pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relief, helping with sleep and anxiety and
stress, lowering inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, now I want to ask you a few
business questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see all of the top companies in
this space coming from North America at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there a starting to see movement in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we really have a lot of the top
pharmaceutical companies based,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's in Malta or in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we slow to catch up or North
America just too far ahead of us at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a very good question,
Owen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often think of where we're based on
Fitzwilliam Square.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's notorious for being the aircraft
leasing square of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently, 70% of aircrafts are leased
from Fitzwilliam Square.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at the square,
it also has a very strong representation
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to companies in North
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our space, unusually strong,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So GW Pharma, who would be, I suppose,
one of the companies that we would have
[SPEAKER_02]: looked to when we started pioneering in
this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: GW were bought out, I believe,
two years ago for, I believe, 7.6 billion
[SPEAKER_02]: by Jazz Pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jazz Pharma are a couple of doors down.
[SPEAKER_02]: GW were as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Satis Pharma and some of the other
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tilray, apparently, is around the
corner as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's quite a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting to see that they're
all on our doorstep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, one of our programs
is with Trinity College in Dublin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the alumni get this
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I often get WhatsApp or LinkedIn
messages referring to any news that is put
[SPEAKER_02]: out in Trinity College.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look, it's a very small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not many companies globally in
this arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's certainly one to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that's the high capital
cost, initially, and intensive capital to
[SPEAKER_00]: start, and the expertise that's required?
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically is a hindrance to a lot of
companies putting their foot in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm not as involved in the company
as much as Andy is these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do look after the investor relations
for Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Greg and Andy would be at the
forefront of the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Professor Saoirse O'Sullivan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Professor Saoirse O'Sullivan is a Clon
Tariff native.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also Dublin Girl and ex-Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, Andy is just across the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when myself and Greg formed this
company, we asked many people who were the
[SPEAKER_02]: best people in this area, this arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Andy's name was brought up a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thankfully, he came on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I suppose, look, since 2017,
we've been building the board clinically
[SPEAKER_02]: very strong in Europe and in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the board in the US has always been
very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we work with various universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I would say is that we identified
our competition when we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were never going to go into growing
cannabis and going down that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we wanted was a pharmaceutical
company to focus on the triggers of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we differentiated ourselves immediately
from the very start, which helped us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt absolutely, I suppose Greg would
have 30 years experience with pharma
[SPEAKER_02]: companies in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Connie McSuey is our chairwoman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has been head of many big,
large public companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cattlezyme is one where she was
chairperson for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we knew the costs involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to set it up so we could
deliver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Andy touched on, what we wanted to
do was we knew people weren't going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get the right doses if they drank
10 bottles of CBD a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it would affect their liver and
kidneys and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the outset, we felt prescribing,
getting our programs to be able to be
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribed was the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a longer road.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a far more expensive road.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we haven't changed from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the management decisions have been
with a view to FDA approval, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously our core crystal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Core crystals have been FDA approved
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've stuck to a pretty tight guideline
and mandate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been very disciplined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually benefit from the best of
all worlds, as Peter alluded to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're listed on the NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got a North American biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very strong management team and board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our Irish operations,
which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Trinity College, with the
expertise there, we really tap it into
[SPEAKER_01]: both preclinically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got preclinical work ongoing,
but also the clinical study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope to engage more sites in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from a UK perspective,
I'm sat here today in the ex-AstraZeneca R
[SPEAKER_01]: &D facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can tap into worldwide middle-class
research here on our door, drug
[SPEAKER_01]: development, actually, research on our
doorstep, and benefit from a fantastic R&D
[SPEAKER_01]: credit environment which the UK has put in
place, which allows us to do the best
[SPEAKER_01]: research at the lowest cost base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've nearly hit our time already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flowing by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one quick question left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew, you might be able to answer this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: From start to finish, what's the rough
time scale that it takes you to go from
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighting a potential drug that you can
make and going through all the various
[SPEAKER_00]: trials?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it one year, five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: To take it through a trial will take
between one to two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may need more than one trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also is obvious, but it depends on
where you start from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with our lead clinical compound,
we actually licensed that compound from
[SPEAKER_01]: AstraZeneca.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously a world-known pharmaceutical
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they actually already spent four or
five years researching this drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't work for what they wanted it to
work in, but we saw a different
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at a five-year development
timeline, and we're well into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For drugs that are more in the preclinical
space, which is our fatty acid binding
[SPEAKER_01]: protein inhibitor, we've actually already
had four or five years' worth of research
[SPEAKER_01]: in that from our partner at Stony Brook
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're now taking it on its journey
into the clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you could probably expect about
four to five years in the clinic before it
[SPEAKER_01]: could become a registered drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same for the Cochrystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, gentlemen, the time is up already,
but I think Artelo Biosciences is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the top companies that are found in this
space around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the next five to 10 years is
going to be very exciting to see all the
[SPEAKER_00]: IP that come out of this industry and all
the benefit that can be created for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients from all the hard work you guys
are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And appreciate the invite to come and
speak to you and your listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope we can chat to you guys again,
maybe at the start of 2023, and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: far along the line we are with the process
you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to know more about Artelo
Biosciences, the website is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the links will be posted in the
description wherever you're watching or
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for now, Peter and Andrew,
thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next episode, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
