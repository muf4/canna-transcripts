[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to join in this episode
with Owen Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Owen has two decades of experience in the
Canadian cannabis industry and possesses a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide range of subject matter expertise
based on two decades working with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the industry, from patients
to advocates, dispensaries, producers and
[SPEAKER_00]: processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also one of the most important men on
a course to editables in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Owen, thank you very much for taking
the time to join us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to have you on, mate, great to have
you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you seem to be an integral part of one
of the big sectors within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in Canada and getting the
legislation and the legal process moved
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of how long you've been in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: from, say, your general manager days in
the dispensaries through to Aurora and
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're at now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I came in right at the sort
of this wave of cannabis advocacy on the
[SPEAKER_01]: West Coast that happened in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: My family, I moved here in the mid 90s
from England and they didn't have any idea
[SPEAKER_01]: they were plotting me down in such a
hotbed of herbal medicine activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started off with the university and
college as a volunteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a man named Ted Smith who
owned the very first cannabis dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the longest running, it's still open,
it's still operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He introduced me to medical cannabis back
in the early 2000s when I was at college
[SPEAKER_01]: and university.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just medical, but the hemp and
really just opening my eyes to sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite view that I've been taught as a
child and many is taught during
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is bad, but he taught how there's
many positives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became his employee some years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: My younger sister contracted cancer,
skin cancer, melanoma skin cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was at the end of the options from
the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ted Smith in the club at this time in
the early 2000s helped her during the last
[SPEAKER_01]: months of her life.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did die after one year after
contracting melanoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a deadly condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she got benefited quality of life-wise
being able to restore her ability to eat
[SPEAKER_01]: and have a good sleep, which helped her
communicate with her family during the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can imagine, that's an invaluable
time to be able to communicate with your
[SPEAKER_01]: loved one who's gonna die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw the value in that and I wanted to
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I became the baker and the product
maker for Ted Smith.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was only one year after I'd started
that, that I got arrested in a local
[SPEAKER_01]: downtown apartment building in Victoria,
BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in response to the arrest,
we raised a constitutional challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was to the current medical
marijuana laws, which only allowed in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, people to have dried cannabis and
they'd have to smoke it or they'd have to
[SPEAKER_01]: chew it and swallow that down hole,
which didn't make any sense to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We extracted cannabis into vegetable oils,
butters and made food out of it to serve
[SPEAKER_01]: people with cancer and AIDS and lots of
serious medical conditions, only helping
[SPEAKER_01]: those who had permanent physical diseases
and ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so taking it to court in 2012,
we won in the BC Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then took it all the way up to the
Supreme Court of Canada where we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: unanimous victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: There and instantly made edibles,
oils, extracts legal for anybody in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for interrupting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the R.V.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith challenge that you're describing
there, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I beat the Smith, but there's a Ted
Smith as well and we're not related,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we work together all the way through
all the way through the communications
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: That went along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We launched a newspaper called Cannabis
Digest and we used that to help publicize
[SPEAKER_01]: the truth about the case while the
newspapers muddied it up and got the
[SPEAKER_01]: details wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We published 10,000 copies and distributed
them across the country just to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that people knew what was really going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after we did win in Supreme Court of
Canada, the government were forced to make
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called Section 56 laws and they
introduced a new limits called 3% limits
[SPEAKER_01]: on the strength of the edibles and oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a limit that wasn't
established in the court, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that governments can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make laws here in Canada and courts
chop them down, chop them up, make them
[SPEAKER_01]: null and void the parts which aren't
constitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the government, in my opinion,
has reintroduced an unconstitutional
[SPEAKER_01]: limit, an arbitrary limit on the strength
of the edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has carried over into the legal
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to buy legal recreational
cannabis, edible wines, you're restricted
[SPEAKER_01]: to a very low dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while that's good, helps people get in
newbies, especially who we really cared
[SPEAKER_01]: about, who we're really working for as the
most sick, most vulnerable, most in need
[SPEAKER_01]: and those people need higher doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we continue to provide higher dose
cannabis against the law in Victoria,
[SPEAKER_01]: BC to over 3000, more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a lot of people who access
cannabis through the Victoria Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Buyers Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the longest running dispensary in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this club was recently charged $6.5
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fine was sent from the provincial
government to basically to shut the club
[SPEAKER_01]: down, which is not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In response to that, another
constitutional challenge has been raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big 700 page document full of patient
stories and full of legal arguments has
[SPEAKER_01]: been in Health Canada's hands for over a
year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're pushing for an exemption to the
Cannabis Act so that we can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide those higher strength cannabis
products to those who have higher needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something that we protest in
the street for still these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This last week, down in the front of City
Hall in Victoria, BC, doing a live trivia
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis game show with a crowd of people
where we showed the public that we can be
[SPEAKER_01]: a fun, open community of people,
very knowledgeable and teach a few things
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're out in the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been that way all along,
trying to bring cannabis out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: shadows, trying to be as out there as we
can, come out of the closet as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not all serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you guys were successful with the
Orv Smith Challenge, what was it like then
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a community, channels of
communication with the relevant parties to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to ensure that what you guys
wanted got enacted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's what we had argued with the
Harper government all the way to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Harper government in Canada wanted to
introduce mandatory minimum sentencing for
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was doing and also for growing more
than six cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are new laws at the time that we
protested against.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the government in Canada, especially
the Conservative government, has been very
[SPEAKER_01]: oppositional to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so no easy communications could be
made there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in BC, it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had things like the Sensible BC
campaign, which came before legalisation,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we tried to decriminalise cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a much higher bar for having to
get more votes than Washington or
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, who at that time, their voting
initiatives got them legalised cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had to fight really hard in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a high bar, I think,
for getting this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the Liberal government now,
since they put in the Cannabis Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a four year review of that act,
which has been delayed thanks to Covid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while working with Aurora Cannabis,
I helped to put together some suggestions
[SPEAKER_01]: and some ideas that the government might
use to improve the system, including the
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious ones that I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of other ways we can
improve cannabis in Canada, too,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of fun that could still come to
what is really over-regulated,
[SPEAKER_01]: hyper-regulated industry, which you can
expect because we're the first in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm excited about is tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to encourage people to come from
Ireland to enjoy a nice farm tour from
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis tours, enjoy our beautiful
natural environment and the finest
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that you'll ever see or
experience in your life and a touch of the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture that's grown up here, too,
which is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tourism is certainly a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think tourism is one thing you
haven't heard come out of Canada yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: is any sort of promotion or any sort of
cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas even in Ireland, we hear things
about Vegas and Arizona, where you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people go to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got New York coming online now,
which is going to, I think, be a huge hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the channel communication
between the Canadian tourism companies who
[SPEAKER_00]: may be operating these tours and Europe
don't seem to be as clear as it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before legalization, I operated a couple
of consumption lounges, they call vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: lounges, where you'd have cannabis
cocktails being served.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd come and have a Bloody Mary Jane or
another one of these that we made up,
[SPEAKER_01]: fun name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dab bar laid out, so you could
learn how to dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how much dabbing goes on in
Ireland, but here it's very popular on the
[SPEAKER_01]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I teach you how to do these things a
little bit safely, have somebody there who
[SPEAKER_01]: can instruct newcomers, people coming from
overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a little bit of instruction on
how to consume cannabis safely,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that attracts a lot of
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd have musicians coming in,
comedians, sort of a central hub in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so nice to be able to come out of
the woodwork and come together and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: centralized place to consume and
communicate and socialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like after so much isolation,
social isolation in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could all use sitting down and having a
nice cup of vape or whatever it is we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quickly before we go, what are you
looking forward to over the next 12 to 18
[SPEAKER_00]: months in the Canadian cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one thing you've got your eyes
on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, like I say, the consumption
lounges is an issue which is on the
[SPEAKER_01]: forefront of the British Columbia
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's slow moving in terms of
development of the industry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID is part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've just had released the direct
delivery system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally, B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: producers can sell directly to B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers without having to go through the
government warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a strike here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: where no retailers could purchase any
cannabis because the B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: government controls that channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fortunately, now that is over and the
direct delivery is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next part of that is called
Farmgate, which is having a store at your
[SPEAKER_01]: farm so that people can come to the farm,
meet you, maybe go on a tour and go to
[SPEAKER_01]: your gift shop and purchase some cannabis
there while they're on vacation,
[SPEAKER_01]: while they're on a tour and take that at
least while they're in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't take it on to playing with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Farmgate and direct delivery are the
most exciting two things that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: to to British Columbia, but consumption
lounges hot on the heels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to the community being
able to come together more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this year, we had our first major
cannabis convention in Victoria,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the capital of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to take over the Empress
Hotel, which is this landmark piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture in downtown Victoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a vapor lounge right in the
center of town elevated in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really felt like times had changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so I'm hoping for more of that and
more more of us to be able to share ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: like this and develop the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic chatting to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wealth of information committee so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's going to have looked
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll be back on to you and I'll
get some suggestions for people to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: in the direct delivery, the farm gate and
the consumption lounge area so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: inform everybody over in Europe what to
expect the next time they go to Canada on
[SPEAKER_00]: holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like any suggestions for people
to talk to over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody will see on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
