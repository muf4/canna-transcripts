[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined in this
episode by John Hudak, deputy director of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Centre for effective public
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Senior Fellow in Government Studies
at the Brookings Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, John?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of topics I wanted to talk to
you about and maybe first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get the audience up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get involved at the Brookings
Institute and what was your first initial
[SPEAKER_00]: start in the cannabis industry or covering
the cannabis industry, should I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, after I got out of graduate
school or as I was nearing the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate school, I was expecting to go
into a teaching job at a university and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got someone reached out to me from
Brookings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an opening to see if I was
interested in applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything moved sort of quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't expect to be working in a think
tank ultimately, but that was 10 years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and here I am still churning stuff out at
Brookings.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of how I started in cannabis,
that was very accidental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a colleague who recommended
I take a look at some work that was being
[SPEAKER_01]: done around polling in Colorado and
Washington before those two states
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you ask a lot of questions in
your research that might be applicable to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of laughed him out of my office,
truth be told.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, I took a look at some of the
things he was sending me and I found the
[SPEAKER_01]: topic really interesting and launched a
project in 2014 evaluating Colorado's
[SPEAKER_01]: implementation of their legal cannabis
system and just kept building it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: broader part of my research portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who don't know, the Brookings
Institute is one of the most revered think
[SPEAKER_00]: tanks in the world and when they release a
paper on a topic, it generally moves the
[SPEAKER_00]: needle far more than, let's say,
some of the industry experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great review of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your book that you released in 2016,
what was the reasoning behind that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just developed a huge amount of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a lot of research going on
that wasn't being tied together,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, in a concise way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some books on cannabis that
were very laser focused on specific
[SPEAKER_01]: topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other ones that were hundreds
and hundreds of pages long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brookings was actually interested in
putting together a series of books that
[SPEAKER_01]: explained short histories on a variety of
policy topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked me if I'd be interested in
writing one on cannabis and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, was.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I ended up putting together was a
policy history largely in the 1900s and
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000s, although some earlier dates appear
in the book as well, to explain the policy
[SPEAKER_01]: and political history of cannabis largely
in the United States, although there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit in there about nations abroad
that have dealt with the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It serves more as almost like a four
dummies book, catch you up to speed on
[SPEAKER_01]: what's gone on in cannabis policy over a
150-year period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a light read, an easy read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beach read, people tell me,
and so obviously I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everybody, the link for the book
will be posted in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to click on it and buy it
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I wanted, John, I wanted to
kind of focus as much as I can on Ireland
[SPEAKER_00]: with your skill set, because you guys
obviously know federal legalization yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's some way forward as to what an
industry would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over in Ireland, we're still stuck with a
medical cannabis program where even if a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor prescribes it, it has to be okayed
by a secondary consultant who generally is
[SPEAKER_00]: over the age of 65, 70, and doesn't really
understand what they might be even
[SPEAKER_00]: remotely talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first topic I wanted to talk about
was how cannabis emerged from the shadows,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the types of parts of your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did cannabis emerge from the
shadows in America?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the first initial pillar that got
the industry out of the open for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, during the 1970s and 1980s,
early 1980s in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: views on cannabis began to shift some,
and you saw some states stepping up to
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalize cannabis, that is to make a
cannabis crime the equivalent of a
[SPEAKER_01]: speeding ticket or a parking ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few states moved forward with that
approach, and it was seen as a
[SPEAKER_01]: reprioritization of police dollars,
that is that there were more important
[SPEAKER_01]: things for police departments to deal with
than low-level cannabis offenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was during a period of fairly high
crime rates in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly violent crime rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back into a period of shadows when
Ronald Reagan became president and really
[SPEAKER_01]: began to reiterate the war on drugs in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, the years of racial
strife, police power, a real focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: criminalization of a lot of things,
including low-level drug offenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: began to get displaced, oddly enough,
by the AIDS epidemic in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you found was in some big cities,
particularly in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also in LA and New York and elsewhere,
doctors and nurses and, most importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: patients were recognizing that cannabis
helped with some of the side effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmaceuticals, early pharmaceuticals
being used to treat HIV and AIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that began to put crack in this system
where people were looking at cannabis as
[SPEAKER_01]: something not as terrible as the
government was telling them it was and
[SPEAKER_01]: something that might actually,
under certain circumstances, have medical
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so began the path toward reform,
starting really in the mid-1990s in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States and really skyrocketing
forward to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so great little breakdown there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think of being,
let's say, the two biggest benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis coming out into the main industry
market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it been revenue for the government?
[SPEAKER_00]: Social equity programs, patient access.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think if a politician from
Ireland is looking at this, wondering why
[SPEAKER_00]: would we legalize it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the kind of two pillars that
people would be looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's worth a run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I advise state and local
governments on cannabis reform,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things I always tell them is to
discount the revenue that comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never as much as people imagine it's
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a significant amount of money,
no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to set citizen
expectations about how much money that
[SPEAKER_01]: will mean, how much money it means
relative to the larger municipal or state
[SPEAKER_01]: budget, and certainly what that money will
actually end up doing in terms of dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with budget deficits or the ability to
fund certain programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two areas that I think, though,
it is most impactful, cannabis reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: First is for patient care.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of patients in the United
States who will tell you that they benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly from the use of cannabis,
whether it's for pain management,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's to deal with seizure
disorders, whether it's to deal with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of appetite for a variety of reasons,
most commonly associated with HIV AIDS or
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotherapy treatments for cancer,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people, it helps them sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people, it helps them focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of benefits either
demonstrated through government regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: processes or just anecdotally from
patients that they are getting those types
[SPEAKER_01]: of benefits without traditional
pharmaceuticals, some of which,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly for pain management,
come with significant risks and obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: risks for addiction and dependence as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second area in which I think it has a
major impact in the United States is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the criminal justice space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that states are no longer
arresting individuals for low-level
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis offenses in mass numbers is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the problems we've had in the
United States is that while the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: arrests in a lot of states that have
legalized cannabis have plummeted,
[SPEAKER_01]: the racial disparities in the remaining
arrests remain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work to do in the
criminal justice space with regard to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, we are arresting hundreds of
thousands of fewer people in states that
[SPEAKER_01]: have legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a different life trajectory for
those individuals who have been spared
[SPEAKER_01]: five, 10, 15 years ago would have landed
them in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two very good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a national day of action over
here in Ireland on the 23rd of August
[SPEAKER_00]: where patients for safe access,
everybody's joining out to the Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a lot of steam coming in
the Irish industry at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys look at the European sector at
all or do you just focus strictly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: American industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pretty large focus on the
American industry and advocacy space and
[SPEAKER_01]: policy space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much going on here and changing
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes up a lot of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there are lessons to be
learned from the European model in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, especially with regard to
medical cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis research has been stymied
in the United States because of
[SPEAKER_01]: ideological reasons, because of
bureaucratic reasons, and really for
[SPEAKER_01]: nonsensical reasons in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research into medical cannabis and the
efficacy of medical cannabis for a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of conditions and diseases has really
grown significantly in places like the EU,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Israel and elsewhere, where those types
of bureaucratic barriers are reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: relative to the American model.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I often tell policymakers in the US
is that Europe is having our lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be doing this type of cutting
edge research but Europe is doing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real problem but it demonstrates
that even in a peer government like the
[SPEAKER_01]: EU, the US doesn't have to be afraid of at
least allowing the freedom to conduct
[SPEAKER_01]: research into this substance and better
understand what it will mean for
[SPEAKER_01]: prospective patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where Europe at the moment
seems to be a little all over the place
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to patient access.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Spain is legalizing a medical
cannabis program in the end of December
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it specialists allowed to prescribe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they allowed to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas over in Ireland, you've got maybe
seven neuroplasticity and post-chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea that are allowed on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, a consultant who has nothing to
do with the patient, the doctor has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one to sign off on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates that extra barrier that when
you did your paper, the report on the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana mess, was that paper
targeted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it targeted at health officials or was
it targeted at a broader consumer basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was targeted at policymakers who
work in the public health sector as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as healthcare professionals as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned at the outset of the
podcast that the secondary consultants in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland who need to sign off on doctor's
prescriptions for cannabis are oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: older practitioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a problem we face in the United
States as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have entire classes of doctors who
went through medical school being taught
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis is bad in all circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to break people out of that,
particularly older practitioners who are
[SPEAKER_01]: more set in their ways who have rigid
ideologies about these substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's certainly not a problem that exists
simply in Ireland or in Europe but in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States and elsewhere around the
world, particularly Latin America as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I oftentimes tell individuals who are
working to change laws around medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is that, yes, it's important to
change the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have to change the culture
within allied health professions to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the newest and latest research
on cannabis, both in terms of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy but also in terms of the risks
and side effects of it or the lack thereof
[SPEAKER_01]: in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: To better understand what patient needs
are and what the risks of alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: therapies, therapies alternative to
cannabis would mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's particularly important in the pain
management space as I mentioned where
[SPEAKER_01]: addiction and dependence issues are
significant as well as overdose issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's true in a variety of areas of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a doctor coming to the table
who's not read up well on medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, that doctor is not doing his or
her job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of the reform around medical
cannabis is not just law and policy but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in medical education at medical
schools but also continuing medical
[SPEAKER_01]: education for practicing doctors and
nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of talk about the
North American companies taking a foothold
[SPEAKER_00]: in the European industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing I actually see them
dominating hands down and having no
[SPEAKER_00]: competition is the expertise coming over
here to educate the doctors en masse,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Peter Grimspoons of the world coming
over here and spreading their knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and expertise I think is one of the
biggest monetization points for the North
[SPEAKER_00]: American industry at the moment as opposed
to them all thinking they can sell tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: flour in a market that doesn't even have a
solidified base yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's most important, I think,
it's true in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's true abroad as well, is that
individuals who are, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: new to cannabis or considering thinking
differently about cannabis, the messenger
[SPEAKER_01]: for the information is critically
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to hear from doctors,
they want to hear from nurses,
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to hear from PhDs, they want to
hear from people in suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to believe people who look
differently than their imagined stereotype
[SPEAKER_01]: of a cannabis user or a cannabis advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here in the United States,
we have a sort of mixed bag when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to the way that individuals present
themselves while lobbying or advocating in
[SPEAKER_01]: other settings for medical cannabis or
adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see is that the more
professionalized that movement is and the
[SPEAKER_01]: more professionalized that movement
appears, the more likely individuals will
[SPEAKER_01]: be receptive to that message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors hearing from doctors and nurses
about their own experience clinically
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot be overmatched by papers that
they're reading in academic journals or
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy messages that they're reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hearing that are more,
let's say, stereotypical in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was doing my research, I came
across myself saying, this is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most influential voices in American
cannabis and you haven't disappointed at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely amazing talking to
you and hopefully we get to talk again in
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 months time and we can give you an
update on what's happening over here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you very much for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you on our next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
