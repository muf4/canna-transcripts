[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Warren Bobrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the co-founder and CEO of Close
Apple to Carries.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Warren, you well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reading a lot about you now and
you've got a launch, you're a drink coming
[SPEAKER_01]: next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you maybe give everybody an
overview of how you went from the banking
[SPEAKER_01]: industry to the cocktail whisperer into
the cannabis industry now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've used cannabis recreationally
and also medicinally since I was about 12
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm 60 now, so it's not just
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a different path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of failures and I felt that
if you were going to be passionate about
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that you do in life, you should
find out what you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked in the off and on premise
liquor industry for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rum judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for a Russian company named
Marousia beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was a great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see the world, but it also put
about 50 pounds on me that I didn't need
[SPEAKER_00]: because of all the high sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I developed some health problems,
not massive health problems, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: developed glaucoma, which I knew was
exacerbated by the amount of sugar that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was intaking by being a rum judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I during July of 2018, it was Tales of
the Cocktail down in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took my last distilled spirit
strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, and so now you've got a close up
of the carries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I was doing a little bit of research
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I realized that Klaus is a translation
for victory of the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apothecary is a person who sold medicine
and drugs at one stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know, was I right in my
investigation that those two names were
[SPEAKER_01]: put together intentionally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Klaus is his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, you know, I do have a physical
German drinking gnome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a, you know, he's a good little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can get him out of his out
of his place where I have him someplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to move, move around a little bit
when you do broadcastings with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a traditional German drinking gnome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found him to be quite a wingman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was traveling around the
world by myself and you pull him out and
[SPEAKER_00]: put him on the table and he starts
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I named my beverage after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I should say, you know,
I wrote the book of cannabis cocktails and
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote another book named Apothecary
Cocktails, you know, two of my six books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the whole idea of
gnomes and apothecary ends and healing all
[SPEAKER_00]: work well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you know, it's mystical,
mystical thought, mystical healing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, being in Ireland,
you have a great appreciation for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we certainly would.
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating all sorts of magical potions and
spells over here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you maybe give everybody a little
overview about the drink that's launched
[SPEAKER_01]: next week?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know you're an expert mixologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you let us know what you're in store
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we've got a number of cool brands
over the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see we've got the guys,
Luke and Jake at Cannes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Xander at Arthet in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of excitement in the
beverage space that the non-sugar beverage
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us what to expect from your
range of drinks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my my range of drinks are made with
all natural ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ginger syrup is USDA certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the citrus element is from a company
in France named Le Vergerboire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't use any any chemical
pesticides in any of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I chose to use their lime puree in
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a rice vinegar effect in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of rice vinegar,
which gives it a tangy effervescence in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way, but no fizz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not like a, you know,
a clear seltzer with industrialized
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an offshoot of my own mixology of
my bartending experience where I would
[SPEAKER_00]: create drinks for customers or guests who
would come to want to get drunk by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this this does n't have any
alcohol in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've took a route of turpene forward as
opposed to making drinks that only say
[SPEAKER_00]: they have cannabis on the label,
but you don't have any idea what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could name a dozen of them that don't
taste anything like cannabis, although
[SPEAKER_00]: they say they have cannabis in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that wasn't my approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: My approach was to create a beverage that
smelled like cannabis, tasted like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and tasted like the other three
amazing ingredients which are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple drink and it's
something that you can recreate quickly if
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that sounds pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what what can we expect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just going to be in the US for now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my my business partner was
saying something about Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what do I know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it will be to march herself into
as many territories as you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself into the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I said, I'm not a young man,
although I'm young at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to be able to move forward in
this pretty quickly because I'm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of my life where I'd like to spend
more time promoting rather than selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I understand completely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something that you can help me
promote is what the future cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cocktails and social spaces will look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a couple of consumption lounges
open up in South or South Francisco,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'd be a bit of a fool not to think
that one's time, let's say in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: once legalization fully kicks in next
March, that there will be money in spaces
[SPEAKER_01]: being created that serves nothing but
cannabis, that has music associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry, food associated
with the cannabis industry, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific genetics and the specific drinks
will be of high premium content and of
[SPEAKER_01]: high value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the way you see it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh, I would love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been to Amsterdam a dozen
times and enjoyed everything that there
[SPEAKER_00]: has to do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't go to Amsterdam just for the
museums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to see that that image of
the coffee shop played back in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you know, we have a lot of
stigmas in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis may be quote unquote
legal, but you can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many counties in the state which
are doing something that they call home
[SPEAKER_00]: rule where, you know, they don't want
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stigmatizing it and keeping the
stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when my own company is located in
California, I like spending time there
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't have to look over my
shoulder quite so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me this on a personal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's your favorite state to smoke
and consume cannabis in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's got the best place in America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's that's I hope I don't antagonize
anyone by saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, my very favorite is Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure what it is,
but it reminds me the most of Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I lived in Maine back in the
1980s, you know, cannabis was still
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one could buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so when I go to Oregon, I feel like
I'm in Maine without the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what we've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people actually say Oregon and
a good friend of the show, Jeremy Plumb
[SPEAKER_01]: from Proof Cultivars is based out in
Oregon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they seem to have a very high pedigree
of cultivars and geneticists out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are your plans for the end of this
year and the rest of the whole of entire
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022 is coming up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I I'm the co-owner and co-founder of
of Klaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the gnome, but the beverage next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's December 8th and 9th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be out there 7th, 8th and 9th in Palm
Springs, releasing Klaus the beverage for
[SPEAKER_00]: for dispensaries and doing a couple of
parties while I'm out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll hope to get back out before the
end of the year to to do some hand selling
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, little events here and
there where they pop up, basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on getting the the product out
and the beverage out there for for
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and for guests and and getting
it in their hands and letting them taste
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's, as I said, it's not a
seltzer and it's made with real
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients and it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sophisticated and delicious and not
sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sophisticated and delicious sound like two
of my favorite words, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of milligram dosage is it or is
that important when it comes to a drink
[SPEAKER_01]: like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the the length and duration of the
balls that you make?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using 10 milligrams of terpene
forward emulsified nanotechnology THC from
[SPEAKER_00]: Vertosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, you know, the last I took,
I enjoyed a little can of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drank the half of the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has about a five minute onset,
so it's very quick and it's we're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain which is called Hippie
Crasher and it is a indica dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a it's a nice talkative nature
into relaxation and eventually at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the night, good sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like absolutely a dream for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to next time I'm over in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be looking out for work and get my
hands on some of the drink and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: we can touch base with you early next
year, the middle of next year and see how
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's getting on for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to thank you very much for
coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been amazing talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and thanks for putting up with
me moving around the the it's actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: the website is drinkklaus.com so I think
you should go back and just re-edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: www .drinkklaus.com
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're at K.L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: No E.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a clause, but it's a class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have that up there now for everybody
to see and go and check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bingo, bango.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warren, it's been an absolute pleasure
talking to you and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: touching base with you in the year and see
how everything's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
