[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Brian Yogger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the founder and CEO of Lemon Haze,
one of the hottest brands in America over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 12 months in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Owen, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following over the last 12
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys seem to have skyrocketed with the
golf event that you had over in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a couple of other different
events that you're going to be changing
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of how people network in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of how you kind of went from
[SPEAKER_00]: American football college coach into
founding Lemon Haze in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like you take three steps
backwards and tripped over the dog and
[SPEAKER_01]: fell into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been an absolute amazing ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you hit that nail around the
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing up and coming out of college,
my goal had always been to coach college
[SPEAKER_01]: football, which I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: After playing, did that for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that started, you know,
I did that all over the country from
[SPEAKER_01]: schools here in the big 12 to the Ivy
League.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that kind of started to run its
course, I ended up actually moving back to
[SPEAKER_01]: my hometown of Austin, Texas, and starting
my first company back in Austin that was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a construction company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that for a few years when kind of out
of the blue, an opportunity came about for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to move to Seattle and get into the
cannabis industry, when at that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: only two states, Washington state and
Colorado were legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got in very, very early in Washington
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the original reason I had moved
there kind of fizzled out, I decided that
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the industry and wanted to
wanted to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started what was a company called Ted
Trek, which is a precursor to Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what is now currently Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe it or not, we actually started
as a data company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing a lot of the data for the
recreational marijuana industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started putting on events to promote
our data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started doing those events were
strictly business to business industry
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, we looked up and we
were having a whole lot of success with
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the data was kind of stagnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we moved over full time into events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in, you know, started in 2015,
started in 2019, started expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: nationally, started getting into Oregon,
California and Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this funny little thing called COVID
came around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have heard about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a put brakes on pretty much all of our
expansion plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, we started looking at an
idea of how to come out of COVID with
[SPEAKER_01]: events and golf with socially distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just said, you know, let's just
limit it to executives for networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you talked about C-suite,
VPs and directors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted just to golf like a bottle
ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we knew it, we were doing eight
tournaments around the country in eight
[SPEAKER_01]: different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just a ton of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just keep going with it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of brings me straight onto the
first topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about Lemon Haze going
for a hole in one, which are kind of new
[SPEAKER_00]: networking events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over in Dublin and I kind of heard
about it both through golf channels and
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cannabis channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of proves to you that the event
was a roaring success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of found its way to me without
anybody kind of sending any information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's definitely a need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably agree in the industry,
there's enough events that people go to
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the same kind of circular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go around a couple of booths and
unless you're a sociable person,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very hard to kind of network at those
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get dominated by a specific kind of
personality person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with golf, you're stuck with a
group of four people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get to know that person a hell of
a lot better and let them know their
[SPEAKER_00]: industry bought better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have a few different questions
that you'll be able to formulate over a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of hours time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see this being the cure sore for
you kind of moving into other territories
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're going to have networking
events outside of golf as much as golf
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a success for you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see other territories for growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the perfect segue to get into new
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect segue to get into new
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even markets outside of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how you said that about the
trade show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where the concept came
around and which has really always been
[SPEAKER_01]: our basis here at Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mentioned before when I got out of
coaching, I started my first company down
[SPEAKER_01]: in Austin as construction company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do trade shows and I would sit for
three days behind a booth and I talked
[SPEAKER_01]: with 350 people of which only eight of
them were the ones I actually wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to because everybody else was just a
random somebody from a different area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I found that after three days of
sitting at a booth, I was making all my
[SPEAKER_01]: business deals at the after party.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole concept of Lemon Haze is really
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of eliminate the actual trade
show part of it of all the randoms and get
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact people you want to network with,
put them in some kind of a party,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case, a golf tournament.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, you're basically putting
the trade show in the after party.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where your networking is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do one of our golf tournaments,
not only are you playing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: executives that you want to meet around
the country, but we also have cocktail
[SPEAKER_01]: parties before the actual scramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the cocktail party afterwards
with the awards and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our events, you have two hours before
the golf, four hours after the golf,
[SPEAKER_01]: and four and a half to five hours during
the golf to network with executives from
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to move that around from market
to market, because as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not federally legal here in the
States yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only legal on the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, if you go from state to state,
not a lot changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, doing an event in
California, Nevada, Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Florida, you might as well be doing
them in France, Belgium, Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're totally different industries from
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people you need to meet in each
one of those industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we've been able to get people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The layout and the different nuances of
government in each state is going to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for you guys to step in and basically be a
great interstate networking event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a genius idea, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some stage, I'll get over to you guys,
and I'll get to have a few rounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw down because I'm a pretty mean
golfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that you probably agree
with me on this, and a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: actually know what they're talking about
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud tenders, the underestimated entry
point to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important do you think bud tenders are
to brands and their entry point into the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to a number of people on this
series of episodes, and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smartest guys have been previous bud
tenders in stores in Canada and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the future for the bud
tenders and some of the events and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and connection events you see happening
for these?
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud tenders, in my opinion,
the bud tenders are just as important as
[SPEAKER_01]: the executives are when it comes to this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, with our golf tournaments,
all our golf tournaments are limited to
[SPEAKER_01]: C-suite VP and directors of those cannabis
companies, because those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: decision-makers of who's going to buy
their treatment equipment, their POS,
[SPEAKER_01]: their data equipment, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, a bud tender is as equally
important to the industry as anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason being, the bud tender is quite
literally the salesperson for every single
[SPEAKER_01]: brand in existence to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talked about, every state is
different, every country is different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at least here in the United States,
right now, if you walk into a dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: or a retailer in any state in this
country, whatever product you buy is going
[SPEAKER_01]: through the hands of a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't walk up to the shelf here and
pull something off the shelf and walk it
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the cashier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally walk in, you just talk with
the bud tender, and you ask them what they
[SPEAKER_01]: have or you tell them what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know what you want, they're going
to grab it for you, but 90% of the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: people walk in and say, I want marijuana,
and the bud tender kind of goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they have to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for something for energy,
to sleep, to whatever, and whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: bud tender recommends is usually what
they're going to pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that bud tender is the salesperson for
the entire industry, to the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer base in that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just as important as anybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would agree, which I think when
you have federal legalization over in the
[SPEAKER_00]: States, the M&As that will happen,
I think bud tenders' real value will come
[SPEAKER_00]: to market then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be like having the high-end
sommelier in a Michelin star restaurant to
[SPEAKER_00]: guys who really know what they're talking
about, who really understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, and like a good DJ,
know what genetics are coming out before
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of hit the market, or those kind
of guys will be at a premium value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you, I'll give you one step
further on where I exactly agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be in the same way, especially when
we do get into federalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: where all of a sudden, you'll probably see
a lot of the growing in the country go to
[SPEAKER_01]: certain areas of the country, similar to
outbreaks that are generally done in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the outdoor growing can
go to Tobacco Row or Southern Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California, and it's gonna become
like wine, where you're gonna have these
[SPEAKER_01]: huge outdoor crops that come in,
and your 2023 crop is not gonna be the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as your 2024 crop, but that bud
tender is gonna be just like somebody at a
[SPEAKER_01]: great wine bar or a wine shop is gonna be
able to tell you the different vintages
[SPEAKER_01]: and the different years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna start seeing the exact same
thing in marijuana, not only when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: down to simple things like, hey,
these are the good old-fashioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: state-of-the-art hybrid, but when it comes
down to actually your premium products and
[SPEAKER_01]: which crops they come out of, and which
crops are better than other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way of vintages of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real cannabis consumer doesn't really
care about having a high THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about a blend of terpenes,
a mix of cannabinoids that are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna suit whatever lifestyle they fit
cannabis into for them, because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a lifestyle for a lot of
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're lifelong consumers as well
when you get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great year for you so far in
the last 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you got planned for 2022?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are doubling down on what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've identified three segments in the
industry to be the most important segments
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: One we just discussed, which is the bud
tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud tenders are the sales person for
every brand in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second is the actual buyer,
because those buyers are the side to
[SPEAKER_01]: decide which products are going into those
dispensaries that the bud tenders can
[SPEAKER_01]: push.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third is the executives that we
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently we're in 12 states doing
events with bud tenders, buyers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and executives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into 2022, we are gonna expand that
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're adding four more states onto our
repertoire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna be doing events next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the states we're already
doing, also now in Colorado, New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_01]: Missouri, Missouri, and Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in addition to the states we
already do of Washington, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: California, Nevada, Oklahoma,
Massachusetts, Florida, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in subsequent years, we'll just
keep adding more and more states going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just be coming back with events
specifically for those bud tenders,
[SPEAKER_01]: events specifically for those buyers,
and the golf events which we started with,
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively for those executives,
C-suite, VPs, and directors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
those are the three segments of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the decision makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The decision makers in cannabis are the
executives, the buyers, and the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do specific events targeted
specifically for people that want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to those targeted groups to meet with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited to be in 14 states by
the end of next year, and 20-something
[SPEAKER_01]: states by the end of 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, as I said, the more of research,
the more impressed I am with Lemon Haze
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you guys have been building over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you've got nothing but
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an upward trajectory for 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, I look forward to lacing up
my glove when I get over to America
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're nearly up on the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't thank you enough, Brian,
for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to check out Lemon
Haze, there's the website below,
[SPEAKER_00]: lemonhaze.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend going and checking them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in the states and you're a
bud tender, you need to be going to one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the events these guys put on because
they're slowly becoming the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: food chain around the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brian, thank you very much again for
coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Owen, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me know whenever you're around one
of our tournaments over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have got a spot to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, guys.
