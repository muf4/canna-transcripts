[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Alison Kurt-Schaffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alison founded Accounting by Design in
2021 to serve New York and New Jersey's
[SPEAKER_00]: trailblazing cannabis entrepreneurs and
she's the director and the co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: the New York Consortium of Cannabis
Accountants whose mission is to promote
[SPEAKER_00]: financial literacy among New York's legacy
market leaders and social equity
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alison, how you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, New York I think is going to
be one of the markets that influence
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe's far more than some of the further
away states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our Irish ancestors over there,
we keep a keen eye on this state of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you ended up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: position you are and the field that you're
working in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started Accounting by Design last
year to work with cannabis entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_01]: in my backyard in New York and New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a born and bred New Yorker and right
now I live not far from Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So focusing on helping those entrepreneurs
come on board in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I want to try and touch on as
many topics that I can for New York to
[SPEAKER_00]: help educate the viewers over the states
and in Ireland about what I think could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly be the best state so far to
legalize in America with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think with the level of
entrepreneurship and the diversity that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in New York, I think you're going
to have an entrepreneurs coming from so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be just one or two
levels of entry like it is in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a brief
overview of what is the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: Consortium of Cannabis Accountants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you guys set it up and what is the
medium to long term aim with this
[SPEAKER_00]: organization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are a group of accountants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with cannabis businesses in New
York and for the most part, we are all New
[SPEAKER_01]: Yorkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we founded the organization because we
identified a real need for financial
[SPEAKER_01]: education in the industry amongst
entrepreneurs that want to enter the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space or have already been
operating the cannabis space pre-license
[SPEAKER_01]: for possibly decades and supporting
livelihoods that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to help transition them from legacy to
legal our vision really is to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market in New York thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're focusing on New York not only
because we are New Yorkers ourselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because like you said, this New York
is a unique market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a large one and it's
going to have a lot of intricacy and
[SPEAKER_01]: detail specific to New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really wanted to hone in on what New
York cannabis entrepreneurs needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our long term goal is really to be the
source of financial literacy and education
[SPEAKER_01]: for these groups that are looking to get
into some of them are, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: new business owners and just an
understanding of what it means to operate
[SPEAKER_01]: in a regulated taxed legal market and
helping with business plans and budgeting
[SPEAKER_01]: down the road and everything you need to
do to get your house in order,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a step one before you begin to
build out your team and do your due
[SPEAKER_01]: diligence getting into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my reading, you guys are a team
of financial wizards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, one of the things I
think about New York where you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to, if you've got even a level
entry into this industry, be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize the skill set of a team of
industry experts like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that happens in very
many cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just going to be the big hedge
funds and the VCs that manage to dominate
[SPEAKER_00]: the entry point into this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that's what what actually plays out
as the market rolls out here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you maybe tell everybody what is
forensic accounting and why will that
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's forensic accounting is basically
using a set series of procedures to build
[SPEAKER_01]: books and records going back in time where
there were none to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of situations where
this may happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can happen with legal businesses just
to have poor accounting systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have those records.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to file tax returns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may be doing that for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big ones is to submit,
you know, as part of the application to
[SPEAKER_01]: the state for your licensure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And myself and some of the other
co-founders of the consortium have been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this sort of back work with legacy
operators as well, who are looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute legacy funds to their new legal
venture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they they need to report and pay tax
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back and building books and
records and and documenting all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology around that is is what we're
doing to help them really be in a good
[SPEAKER_01]: position to submit an application to the
state and to have all their ducks in a
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seems like a great service you guys are
providing for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the end of sales look like
they're beginning in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the licensing that they've
been handed out so far, you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: retail licenses being given out so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, is it is it a broad spectrum or
is it I read that it was the the equity
[SPEAKER_00]: groups are getting the first retail
license in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that being upheld?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still rolling out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, they decided to kick off
with a sort of ingenious approach with the
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're under this like conditional
regime right now, where they've awarded
[SPEAKER_01]: conditional cultivator licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeds are in the ground right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they are rolling out conditional
adult use retail dispensary licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very narrow focus to
kickstart the industry on the cultivator
[SPEAKER_01]: processor side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those licenses are awarded to those that
have experience in growing and processing
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they will get the sort of the
first stab at the THC grows in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the retail side, they have a
very narrow focus here of individuals that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been justice involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a New York conviction and
they have experience running a profitable
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very narrow focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be broader spectrum
regulations and applications released
[SPEAKER_01]: sometime in the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not very good at sort of guessing when
the state's going to act.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's how they're kicking
things off here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want the existing hemp farmers and
processors to be the first to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want those, like I said,
those that fit this very specific profile
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the first to open the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are kind of like state sponsored
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll have lease through the state
loans through the state selected
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it's sort of an interesting,
very unique way to kick off the market
[SPEAKER_01]: here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you basically have a lot of
experience in New Jersey as well as New
[SPEAKER_00]: York with the two states being beside each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the shipping of product now going to be
OK to do because two states are right
[SPEAKER_00]: beside each other or are they still
separate entities when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: products and the cultivation and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as long as as as cannabis is illegal
at the federal level, you cannot ship
[SPEAKER_01]: across state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, two separate microcosm economies
of cannabis right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether there can be some sort of
agreement among like the tri-state,
[SPEAKER_01]: Connecticut, maybe Pennsylvania,
I'm not sure if and how that can play out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now there is no shipping of
product between state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think New Jersey have gotten a head
start or does first to market not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean a head start in this
industry with the amount of pitfalls that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody starting is going to come across?
[SPEAKER_01]: So New Jersey does have adult use sales as
of today, whereas New York does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically speaking, they got the head
start and they had a very different
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave the existing what were referred
to as alternative treatment centers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which the medical facilities that have
been existing for a few years in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey, they were a handful of them were
given approval to sell adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is the MSOs that got the head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New Jersey, which is not what we're
seeing in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a very it's an interesting
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, today you can purchase adult use
cannabis in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not quite there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably won't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is by the end of this year to
have those conditional dispensaries up and
[SPEAKER_01]: operating in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and the next topic I wanted to talk
about was New York cannabis taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we know the rules aren't exactly out
yet when it comes to the exact taxation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've seen already even decided upon
California's tax laws are even known over
[SPEAKER_00]: here for how strict and severe they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw the rollback there recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were designing the taxation for the
New York industry of the three areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got, you've obviously got sales and
retail cultivation in the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: slash processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a sweet taxation number that you
think the government should be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: or should somebody priced a little bit
higher than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I can tell the state
exactly what tax rates, if that's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is an interesting approach here in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the distributors are going to have a
potency based tax imposed on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's going to impact their
negotiations down the supply chain and
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately pricing and really squeeze
their their margins in addition to the
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of 280E, which is the internal
revenue code section that says that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis traffickers cannot take any
deductions or credits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the distributors are going to be hit
hard and that is going to have an impact
[SPEAKER_01]: on pricing down the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a flat tax based on potency as
opposed to sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar to the cultivation tax,
I believe, in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting to see how it's going
to play out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a slightly different tax regime in
New Jersey, which is weight based doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the potency tax in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the intention was or to what was
front of mind in choosing a potency tax
[SPEAKER_01]: typically would be more of a public health
initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to not encourage high THC that they're
going to tax the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an accounting perspective,
there's going to be a lot of record
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping to be maintained, which is what
I've been focusing my attention on in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of keeping track of because the tax
is based on milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without getting too much into the
weeds there, the distributors are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have that tax imposed on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also an excise tax at the retail
level and consumers will be paying sales
[SPEAKER_01]: tax on on cannabis in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New York is the licensing that
people go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true a separate whole department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true, let's say, the licensing
and excise people who would give out
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol licenses and gambling license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a separate entity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's the Office of Cannabis
Management, which was created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was medical marijuana program was
managed under the Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they passed the Department
of Adult Use, they created the Office of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Management and transition the
entire cannabis program, medical adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabinoid hemp to the Office of
Cannabis Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any brands so far that you're
looking forward to seeing launched towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the year or that you think are
going to be able to take a foothold in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry nationally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just generally speaking, I'm looking
forward to seeing what edibles brands come
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking to and working with some
clients that are looking to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in New York, and they're not allowing
edibles in New Jersey yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will be first to market there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to seeing the
ingenuity that's going to come out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles market in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis tourism is going to
skyrocket in New York in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flight's in advance now for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's another huge one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very much the hospitality piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hospitality and cannabis is an awesome
trend that we're going to see explode over
[SPEAKER_01]: the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know to mix in the music events,
music and cannabis is synonymous as a
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine some of the tasting
lounges and experience events that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be happening on the Manhattan
skyline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up in the Hudson Valley, where I'm
located, you have the beautiful landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be really, really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been actually fantastic talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who's looking to get into the
New York industry, we highly recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: check out the New York Consortium of
Cannabis Associators, cannabisaccountants
[SPEAKER_00]: .org.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for coming on the
show, Alison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, everybody, till the next time.
