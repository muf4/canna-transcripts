[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going around the world this time to
Philippines to talk to one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: experts in the Philippines all talking
about cannabis and his name is Jem Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's part of the Philippines Society of
Cannabinoid Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Jem?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a privilege to be on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delighted to have you on and help
educate everybody on what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Philippines in the cannabis industry
and to be able to bestow some information
[SPEAKER_00]: onto everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you came to be part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Philippines Society of Cannabinoid
Medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Philippine Cannabis Movement was
jump-started because of the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: documentary in CNN by Sanjay Gupta that it
was a very famous here in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it basically catapulted the Philippine
Cannabis Movement and shortly after that
[SPEAKER_01]: time, my late sister was diagnosed with
stomach cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I started looking into this
medicinal cannabis and that's when I
[SPEAKER_01]: started to network with other like-minded
doctors and that's how the society began.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, we are lobbying for the
legalization of medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, here in the Philippines,
since 2002, it's already legal to import
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal cannabis pharmaceutical from
abroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, only one out of six
applications have been granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, importation to a third world
country is a very expensive idea and very
[SPEAKER_01]: unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we are pushing for and
advocating for access of full utilization
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis here in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first topic, I wanted to just do a
quick overview of the Philippines and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through a couple of different items to see
how it's comparable to different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys have a medical cannabis
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been able to import medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the list of ailments that sits on
your medical cannabis program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it chronic pain, neuropathic pain,
or is it Dravid syndrome and seizures and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's restricted to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Philippines, of course,
has one of the most notorious drug laws in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put entry in there where you can
import any dangerous drug for medical use
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as it is approved in the country
of origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the compassionate special
permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out it's not the
compassionate at all because the
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements, it's very difficult to...
First of all, you have to find a
[SPEAKER_01]: neurologist and it is only for those with
intractable epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in short, only those with Dravid
syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can
[SPEAKER_01]: apply for a permit and require
environments are very difficult for a
[SPEAKER_01]: normal Filipino to attain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as for the qualifying condition,
that's the only condition, intractable
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only neurologists can prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unlike other epilepsy medications where
any doctor can prescribe, for Epidiolex,
[SPEAKER_01]: only neurologists can prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very, very strict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's accessible on paper,
it's still virtually inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be the pattern across a
number of territories in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very restrictive as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a pretty, what seems to be an
open cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you actually peel back the layers
that a doctor has to get permission from a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant, there's only a handful of
diseases, five different diseases that fit
[SPEAKER_00]: on the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be that a lot of the
countries are taking baby steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: towards a fully fledged market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said only neurologists are allowed
to prescribe over in Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the only rule that they
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: No regular practitioner, no regular doctor
can, let's say, advise a patient to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: a neurologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to book appointments straight
with a neurologist, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, here in the Philippines, you can go
straight to a neurologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it is very difficult to
find a neurologist that is willing to or
[SPEAKER_01]: has a faintest idea about medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another hurdle to cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you find a neurologist,
the cost of importing Epidiolex,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cost of Epidiolex is already like
almost one month salary.
[SPEAKER_01]: of a normal Filipino family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can only afford the medicine if
they don't eat for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the that's the main
reasons why we are really pushing for
[SPEAKER_01]: locally produced medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw from Jazz Pharmacals recently
published that they're on course to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: over a billion euro in Epidiolex sales and
did one hundred and sixty three million in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last quarter alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that they seem to be
making it a product or that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying the world needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a locally sourced version of a
product like Epidiolex or Drabbenol being
[SPEAKER_00]: created in your part of the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there is a bill now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been it's already the medicinal
cannabis compassionate bill was first
[SPEAKER_01]: filed three presidents ago in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it doesn't get passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, it's about establishing
medical cannabis compassionate centers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which controls everything from cultivation
to management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manufacturing and dispensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the that's what is up in the
Congress right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So government produced medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are seeing a bit of light right now
because majority of the senators and
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the congressmen have allegedly
supported it and our new president
[SPEAKER_01]: allegedly also is very supportive of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, everyone knows what's happening
in Thailand, what's happening in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bill here, actually, the Philippines
was the first to file a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, Thailand has overtaken
us and in a blink of an eye with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pandemic, they have gone from medicinal to
now recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the Philippine policymakers
have noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also as well, when we talk with the
other Southeast Asian advocates,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know some of them just like in
Malaysia, where death penalty is
[SPEAKER_01]: applicable for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're about to do also 180
degree turn around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from death penalty to now to
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it's long overdue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, we see a locally produced not just
CBD only, but hopefully all the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: properties of the plant can be locally
produced in pharmaceutical grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was going to be my next
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you guys are positioned in the
world, you've got Australia below you and
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand above you to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they will have an
influence on the Philippines government?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Australia seems to have a pretty
successful program currently running at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand, if they ended up going and
enacting what they say, could be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest tourist hotspots when it comes
to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they will have an effect
on Philippines or is the pull of somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: like China in that area who have a pretty
strict and no rule when it comes to even
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD will have more influence over those
two or two territories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, the Philippines is a very
globalized country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the most hospitable to
foreigners and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we are aware of the
developments abroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we think we are coming around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, most of the literate
population, I think, is open to the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the Philippines is still a
country where majority is in the class D
[SPEAKER_01]: and E, social economic class.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of educating to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, the previous president
with the harshest drug loss, Rodrigo III,
[SPEAKER_01]: he publicly claimed to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the former president, Gloria Arroyo
also, which is now Speaker of the House,
[SPEAKER_01]: admitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Filipino politicians and much of
the educated, open-minded Filipinos,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are very willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, we have a lot of
educating to do as with the other
[SPEAKER_01]: countrymen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the stigmatization of cannabis,
the demonization is still very present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprisingly, the mastermind of the,
if you're aware with the modus of the
[SPEAKER_01]: police before the previous chief of
police, now Senator Ronald de la Rosa,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's the mastermind of the drug operations
responsible, of course, for the thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of allegedly victims of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is now in support of medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very, very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope also to do some modifications
in the bill, because again, the bill now
[SPEAKER_01]: is already eight years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have seen, it was patterned eight
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the developments around the
world, we want to somewhat see some
[SPEAKER_01]: modifications on it, the lessons that
other countries learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to apply it into the current bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic I wanted to jump on to quickly
was the cannabis and the central nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the real breakthrough in
medical cannabis coming from research that
[SPEAKER_00]: targets specific parts of the central
nervous system utilizing cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, the CB1 receptor is the
most abundant G-coupled protein receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: is more abundant than dopamine and opioid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really think this will have an,
it will really disrupt the, how we treat
[SPEAKER_01]: neurological problems and hopefully with
other diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if one will study really
cannabis, we will know that it was used as
[SPEAKER_01]: a panacea or like for a cure-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just the discovery,
of course, of the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: is proof that it has a mechanism of action
in these diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the neurological diseases will be a big
part of it, but also other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated and getting to
talk to you and giving everybody a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get to touch base over
the next six to 12 months and have a part
[SPEAKER_00]: two to this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both Ireland and the Philippines have
marched a little bit forward in their
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really the 15 minutes is a short time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really look forward to our next session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for all the listeners
and of course to you Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody who wants to keep up to date
on the Philippine side of the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, I highly recommend you
go to LinkedIn and follow Jem Mark Matea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the top voices and sources of
information from that part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Jem, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: More blessings to you, Owen, and catch up
with you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you too, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
