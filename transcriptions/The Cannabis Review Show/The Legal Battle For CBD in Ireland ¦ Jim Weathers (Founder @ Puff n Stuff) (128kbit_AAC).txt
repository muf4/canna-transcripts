[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode, the founder of Puffin Stuff based
[SPEAKER_00]: down in Cork is Jim Weathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate you having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major big news at the moment over here in
little old Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yourself and JP are causing a right old
ruckus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview,
maybe not the start, the story of Puffin
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff, but from the initial first legal
processes that you guys went through,
[SPEAKER_00]: when that started and what instigated that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get as much information in the 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically in May 2019 we were rated and
so that was basically a week before JP was
[SPEAKER_01]: rated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were rated on a Saturday and then he
was rated the following Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference really though between our
cases is even though it's pertaining the
[SPEAKER_01]: same products, JP started from being rated
by customs because of importing the
[SPEAKER_01]: product where we were rated because an
individual bought a product from us,
[SPEAKER_01]: was walking down the street and then was
stopped and searched by the guards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when he told them that he bought
that at us from our shop, they came in the
[SPEAKER_01]: following day and asked for samples which
we gave with no problem and showed them
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab reports confirming what the
content of THC was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were kind of oblivious to the
difference between cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about seven months after that,
we got rated and they came in and seized
[SPEAKER_01]: all the products from us and then left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about three months after that,
then they came in and arrested me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then seven months after that,
then they arrested my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, both my wife and I are being
charged with sale and distribution of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so all of the proceedings that we've
been seeing over the last week or two have
[SPEAKER_00]: stemmed from those initial first
processes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so what happened was, so we were
rated in May and then in January of 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: JP and us both filed judicial reviews to
have our cases thrown out because of what
[SPEAKER_01]: basically is unconstitutional what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's against EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're falling within EU laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we filed a judicial review exactly the
same week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, the judicial review
board put our two cases together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the past year, just over a year,
our cases have been running in conjunction
[SPEAKER_01]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, there's been numerous other
cases coming about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, from my understanding that
they're going through the process as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the two biggest high profile cases,
would be JP and Laurel Collins and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Puffin stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Laurel Collins has been a lot more
vocal than I have been during the first
[SPEAKER_01]: four months of our encounter with the
guards and being raided and arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was publicly out in the newspapers on
nearly every radio station.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I was advised by my solicitor
that I needed to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really pissing them off that I was
out there making a way for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stopped and then JP just continued
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since then, we kind of have been just
in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have completely forgot
that we're actually involved in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just been recently over the
past couple of weeks where I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to get a bit more public about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then JP has been tagging us to include
us in the case because actually that case,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, even though we got two
separate cases, they're exactly the same
[SPEAKER_01]: case within the High Court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys have two separate cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judicial review put the two of them
together so they could review them both
[SPEAKER_00]: separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have two separate law entities
representing both of you guys or is there
[SPEAKER_00]: one individual firm now that represents
you both?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have different teams, but they are
working together in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, whatever we file,
JP files.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever JP files, we file the exact same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point in time, everything is
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filed the last papers Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I signed the last affidavits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to court on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got adjourned again until the 22nd of
February.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's gonna happen on that date?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure, but from what we're
hearing that the actual hearing date to
[SPEAKER_01]: finalize this is going to be the 14th and
15th of July is going to be the deciding
[SPEAKER_01]: factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they're going to drop the charges
or the judicial review will allow the
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecution to continue their case against
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's play devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the charges get dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now open season.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the consumer watching this and for
people watching this, what does that now
[SPEAKER_00]: allow have happened in the Irish industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously not gonna regulate any sort
of THC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it just move it in line with the
0.03% level of people with THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would put it in line with 0.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I lost my train of thought there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the exact same case is going on in
France.
[SPEAKER_01]: France has finally changed their drug laws
to allow 0.3% THC in products,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's CBD or food products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 0.3 is allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would suspect that Ireland is gonna
follow suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna definitely open the market up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we win the judicial review,
the CBD market in this country is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: probably explode, but I don't think it's
gonna be something that's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_01]: instantaneously because they're gonna have
to change the misuse of drug law,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we win the judicial review,
that will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will allow the 0.3% or 0.2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there has been rumors, I say rumors,
I've actually got a letter from a TD,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a TD, sorry, from a minister about
three years ago confirming that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change the Misuse of Drug Act to
allow 0.3% THC, but the only thing it
[SPEAKER_01]: stated was that that would be in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been three years and that still
hasn't happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are, we have about six cases
going through the judicial system,
[SPEAKER_01]: costing the state tons of money for
something that they have already admitted
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're going to change at some point
in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, if we've learned one thing
throughout this process, anybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know anything about politics knows
the policy makers are not the quickest of
[SPEAKER_00]: animals in the world and you don't wanna
have patience and thick skin to be dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, but I mean, so the market's not gonna
open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would really hope that that would
happen, but because of the drug laws are
[SPEAKER_01]: not gonna be changed and it could take...
Well, France actually did it fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of how quick the
Irish government is willing to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: change and then at that point,
the market's gonna open.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you're gonna have the contingency
of whether or not they're gonna make the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower still illegal, which France kind of
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So France's stance was the exact as
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they have allowed the 0.3% THC,
they have allowed extraction from the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower to produce CBD, but they have
banned the sale of flowers to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would appear that Ireland would take
the same stance, but France is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being taken to court now to clarify that
the flower can be sold to consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a huge market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it will just be a very good
outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, we talked to Benjamin
Alexandre Jean-Wafer, who's the CEO of
[SPEAKER_00]: Augur Associates in Paris there last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I posed the same question,
is this the end of the CBD flower sales
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he seems to believe the cat's out of
the bag now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna find it very hard to put it
back into the bag and get rid of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you end up turning into a black
market industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that could possibly happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the... It's all contingent on
a...
[SPEAKER_01]: A risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the European Court of Justice said
when they ruled on the cannabis case or
[SPEAKER_01]: overturned the cannabis case in France,
basically was that if a member state was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to completely ban THC entirety,
that they were not gonna allow any
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages, that they would have to do a
risk assessment to prove that the product
[SPEAKER_01]: that is being sold is a risk to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately for us and France,
that there is no such study done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is studies to confirm that there
is no health risk at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely have that in our favor,
but it appears that France has come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard, I don't know exactly what it
is, but they've come up with something to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that it is a health risk and that
they're grasping at those straws to try
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a feeling that that could end up
going back into the European Court of
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice to have them make a final
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, on a little lighter note now,
you'd be a man to answer this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is the best CBD flower being
produced in the world at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the North Americans catching up,
although they've been THC heavy,
[SPEAKER_00]: or have the Europeans had maybe a little
bit of a head start when it comes to this
[SPEAKER_00]: territory where they've kind of had to
deal with this first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the markets and you kind
of got to split it into threes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is the United
States...
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say North America, the United States
and Canada, Europe, and then Switzerland
[SPEAKER_01]: on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the United States and Switzerland,
the allowed THC amount in a CBD product is
[SPEAKER_01]: 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you cannot include Switzerland in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what I've known in the past with
Switzerland, going back almost four years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, what they do is they wash their
products, and that is to drop the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profile of percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they test it again, and if it's
still above the 0.2% to be sold within the
[SPEAKER_01]: European market, then they wash it again
and wash it and wash it until they get it
[SPEAKER_01]: below it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to Switzerland,
I think every single petrol station,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go buy CBD flower, but it is 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer your question, I think that
Europe has, I think, really progressed
[SPEAKER_01]: with the lower percentages of THC
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't really compare Switzerland or
the United States within the European
[SPEAKER_01]: market because of the major difference
in... Is there a quality difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower regardless of the THC content?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a drastic difference,
let's say, in terpene levels or in...?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for quality as far as appearance
looks, it is definitely going to be... The
[SPEAKER_01]: lower of the THC content, the bushier cut
is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to look like bushweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then as that starts going with higher
THC, so getting around the 0.2,
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.3, the flower of the plant is going to
look much nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of that is controlled by also
the grower and how they're producing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or sorry, how they're processing it from
the drying to the curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these people are now using
machines to dry their product,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is causing it to be a browner rather
than a green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a distinctive difference now
that you can look between CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is more of the greener color
where hemp now is tending to be brownish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they're kind of rushing their
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure that every single CBD
producer out there or growing flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: can't keep up with the demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to do whatever they can to try
and get it to market and expediting the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of drying it and curing,
I think is affecting the quality of it
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sooner it's regulated and we get
proper seal of approval on specific
[SPEAKER_00]: products that we're able to buy as a
consumer, I think the better for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're up to our time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for coming on the show,
Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody wants to check out Puffin
Stuff, there's the website below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend going and checking them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a raw, authentic supplier for
Europe and they have a great selection of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best luck with everything over the
next few weeks, Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we're going to get to touch base
with you just after the case and we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully on the evening of the 15th of
July, I hope there will be some fireworks
[SPEAKER_01]: and major celebrations going on because
this is going to be a landmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the first stages of the
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the diary there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back to you beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck.
