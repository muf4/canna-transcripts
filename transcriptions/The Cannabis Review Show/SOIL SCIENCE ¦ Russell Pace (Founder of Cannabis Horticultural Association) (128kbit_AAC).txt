[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Russell Pace, who's the founder of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Horticulture Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russell is also a cannabis cultivation
consultant with a specialization on
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery production and integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been cultivating cannabis for the
last 20 years with the past 16 in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping Russell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to connect overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The technology is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the people who have got a
wealth of information and knowledge that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be bestowed to the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective is just to give everybody
a quick little overview of a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give, I actually
generally, I'm going to jump straight into
[SPEAKER_00]: the first topic instead of doing a big
long introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil science, can you maybe give the
viewer a couple of minutes overview of how
[SPEAKER_00]: important soil science is to the
cultivation process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to give an overarching topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil science to me is the complexities
between soil biology and soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, people just think of
soil science as just what the chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over the last decade, for me
personally, I've learned how important
[SPEAKER_01]: biology is too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got sort of tipped off to it through
Elaine Ingham and her whole soil biology
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We support all of her courses and that
whole industry that's been developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, people think sometimes you just
add nutrients into the soil and the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabis plant or any plant uptake
those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's how the plant absorbs the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's amazing, what's going on
actually inside the soil within the
[SPEAKER_01]: biology is just, it's so staggering how
many reactions are occurring in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to remember how many billions of
microbes there are in one handful of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a staggering number of microbes
in one hand of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your protozoa, your amoebas,
your flagellates, your ciliates,
[SPEAKER_01]: your bacteria, your fungi, your
arthropods.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole range of life that's
occurring in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, when the nutrients go
into the soil, they're not always in
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they're already in the soil,
they're not in bioavailable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what occurs is that there's this
really complex interaction between the
[SPEAKER_01]: root systems and the soil microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the root systems are actually
releasing exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an exudate is just a chemical that...
Actually, I think they're more like
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times, it's a secretion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a secretion that's occurring from
the roots going into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a crosstalk going on with the
biology where the plant's root systems are
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing these exudates to communicate
with microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll talk to fungi and be
like, here, you can have some of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in exchange, I need some potassium or
phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the fungi's high fuel network can
extend many feet outward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're connected, it's like a
little super highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That over here... I'll try to get a
screenshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, it feeds through and can
actually transport nutrients all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: over to the plant's root systems for the
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this incredibly complex
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first, this whole thing was just
like the industry enlarge, feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in the soil and the plants
uptake them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's moving more towards feeding the
soil, make sure you have a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: population of microbiology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what that does is it allows you to
optimize the nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it means that you don't have to use as
much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a really healthy soil biology,
you can use a fraction of the percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: of nutrients and still achieve the same
result or even better because of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know how important it is our
microbiology and our stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to recognize our health
is intricately tied to the microbiome in
[SPEAKER_01]: our stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the same with the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that old alchemist saying,
as above, so below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same process that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to be aware of how important
soil biology is for soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's a brilliant overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a future now where you're
getting basically, let's say, grow at home
[SPEAKER_00]: kits are going to have soil pre-planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as important as the genetics part of
the cultivation process, which again,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the Hutter old market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second topic I wanted to talk to you about
and maybe give, it's something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't know too much about, is
agroecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give to everybody watching a
good overview on what this is and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: specialize in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So agroecology is something that's not
very, I understand it, but it's not in my
[SPEAKER_01]: wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of agroecology to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk with agroecology a lot with my
buddy Matthew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gates, who is an entomologist down in San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a handle, a sink angel on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an absolute powerhouse of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that that's important for me
is that I don't always have all the
[SPEAKER_01]: answers to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do have is the means and
ability to access all of the answers to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I pride myself on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like to me, there's this concept
of agroecology where you're tying in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture with ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they espouse the term agroecology to
try to optimize these large agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're trying to tie them in with
some type of ecological framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe agroecology looks something
like, oh, we have a bunch of acres of this
[SPEAKER_01]: one crop, but we're planting rose,
intercropping rose of some type of
[SPEAKER_01]: companion plant to attract beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agroecology means, oh, we're going to
cover crop this winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any type of way that you can integrate
some ecological methodology into
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, to me, is what agroecology is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's agroecologists that will
chime in and offer their more technical
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, to me, what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like one of those terms
where, I don't know, people overuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sometimes gets misused in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like when a company that's
trying to create a product, like a food
[SPEAKER_01]: product, and they call it natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of gets overused sometimes in some
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important just to understand it
for what it is, which is an important way
[SPEAKER_01]: to integrate ecological methods into
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The objective of this is to educate
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think half the people out there
have the answers to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think by sharing these ideas and
bits of information is how everybody kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gets up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I'm curious to ask you
about, Humboldt County, well, it was maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a year or so ago, got a jurisdiction
almost like champagne when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know the exact purview of exactly
what that law is and what it means to the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the old Appalachians battle,
as they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm definitely sort of in the midst
of just watching everyone work towards
[SPEAKER_01]: creating Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't think there was, it wasn't a
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, you know, there's
classifications they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: establish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the details of like,
it's a complicated topic because
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, I mean, I'll go on a side,
a side tangent here for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, if you look,
I have mixed feelings about it because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at the true Appalachians and
terroir that's associated with wine
[SPEAKER_01]: production, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all are well tuned into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These grapes are growing in the ground for
decades, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis is a plant that is one
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of complex variables
when you're trying to identify how a farm
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to apply for a classification for
Appalachians of a certain region.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like how does the terroir of the
soil, of the sea air affect the growth of
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it affect the secondary
metabolite production, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Champagne region in France would
it's a specific, I don't know a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but it's a specific type of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously those roots go in the ground for
decades and they're sucking out those
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's like acidity levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like very specific things that
produce a flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, I don't know how they're
going to necessarily achieve that in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but they're working towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a poss, there's definitely
a framework of possibility where if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you have to go into the native
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have potting soil, you know,
you have to be in the native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, you'd be using inputs from
that environment, you know, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: important variables that need to be set in
place for those Appalachians to occur,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also happening, I think in Mendocino
County, it's taught the whole Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the hub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the Emerald triangle in Northern
California is that hub where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachians are being talked about and
trying to be developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it's kind of like a tangent,
but it's really, it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's in the, it's a lot of it's
in development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're, I think there's,
what's that, what's that group?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Origins Council.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called the Origins Council.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of information on
Appalachians too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to talk, you might want to
talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be a good person to reach out
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get step by step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand every single component of
this global industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ireland can be a key player when it all
goes legal worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it, what are your laws in Ireland
right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basically an MCAT medical
cannabis access program, but it limits to
[SPEAKER_00]: a handful of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the products are obviously brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the, let's say less suitable
Canada who didn't get it exactly right and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks, Europe is getting a bit of a
tidal wave going now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fairness, you've got Germany,
you're going to have a recreational market
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got movements going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta are going to be a big hole in terms
of the cultivation and processing of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll start to see step by step Europe
come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll have, especially
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers over here are already some of
the best in the world as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think when they get to tap into the
genetics and the real understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, and I think you'll see a
lot of new strains and genetics coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Europe, but in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last topic I wanted to talk to you about
was the best weed is grown in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked a ton of cultivation people
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not putting you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been in Humboldt County since
2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, I would be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say the best weed in the world
is grown in the Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means Humboldt County, Trinity
County, and Mendocino County, Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could say Humboldt County, but I have
too many friends that are in Mendo and
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the whole bio region of that area
where it's been cultivated forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people, these generational farmers
have battled the police forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been getting seeds from
overseas, from Afghanistan and Pakistan
[SPEAKER_01]: and land races from down South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been breeding and cultivating
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the hotbed of where all of this
breeding has occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely, without a doubt,
say the Emerald Triangle is the zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Humboldt County is obviously one of
the best known names.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know about Trinity and
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times when you say Humboldt
County is the best weed in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a certain sense of pride in that
because I've been in the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right on the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I go two miles East and Trinity
County is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's like we're right on the
border there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt County is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just so many amazing genetics and
up here breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started a seed company part of Chas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing seed production now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're producing our whole line of
genetics for concentrate production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in the developing works right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I figure we've done some stuff
before where we figured out where the best
[SPEAKER_00]: oysters are grown in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out it was in Galway by this
Irish family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was because Pacific rainwater came
off the Buran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another bit of soil came off the land and
it combined with Atlantic waters where
[SPEAKER_00]: they were only place in the world that had
Ferrari oysters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were called a graded zero to ten in
terms of the best size.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys had zeros and they used to be
the owner of Harrods all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pretty much picture the Emerald
Triangle is that exact synopsis plus for
[SPEAKER_00]: oysters, the exact nutrients, the exact
pollution, air count, the exact lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: and PDT that they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably somewhere that everybody
should check out on their tourism when
[SPEAKER_00]: they come to Reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check out Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Redwoods, the tallest,
biggest trees in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Redwoods are amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Avenue of the Giants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you Russell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to you all day about this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody wants to check out the
website for the Cannabis Forticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: Association, you can see it there below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have it in the link as well below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure talking to you
Russell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great rest of your day and I
look forward to chatting to you again
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
