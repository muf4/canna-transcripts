[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking all things
copywriting and why it's important in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that, we are joined by an expert
in copywriting, Dave Barton.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the founder and copy chief at
Thermador.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping, Dave?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Friday afternoon here in the UK,
it's nice and sunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's always great when you're
indoors on a lovely sunny day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make no difference to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you in Berlin where we
caught up recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great festival put on by Alex and
the guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might jump on to the festival stuff
towards the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, do you maybe want to give
everybody an overview of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry, how you came to set
up Thermador and the objectives of
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermador?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we call ourselves a sort of
content-led creative agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been a copywriter for more years
than I care to remember, probably more
[SPEAKER_00]: like sort of 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out in sort of BT to B PR.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background was very much arts and
writing and drama and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of finding a way into writing
as a career, it all became like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you know, what is this PR thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I found myself working for an
agency doing lots of writing around
[SPEAKER_00]: obscure things like construction equipment
and work with other agencies and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from like, you know,
engineering works to energy efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really sort of sexy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All food service, mustn't forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mercenary, if you ever get the
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it was always OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a business objective,
lots of technical jargon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we kind of find the story
thread through that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's been consistent
throughout my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up as a freelancer, freelance
copywriter about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still have a business doing sort of tech
writing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But about a year, year and a half ago,
I started to see just more and more stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the cannabis sector,
something that I've always been interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really an opportunity to take
that sort of skill set from writing about
[SPEAKER_00]: complex or stigmatized things and trying
to find human stories or find ways about
[SPEAKER_00]: what does this mean or how are things
operating?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you kind of get into the
cannabis sector, the more you find that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to kind of do some sort of
advocacy to kind of raise the industry for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what we're trying to do,
trying to work with more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to help tell those stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some work with the CIC here in
the UK, the Cannabis Industry Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telling everything from blogs,
helping with websites, social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're doing our own podcast as well,
The Lobster Pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just trying to get different
perspectives from people all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world on what's happening in their niche,
whether it be the niche being a country or
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just trying to find those stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what we're about,
Thermidor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's, copywriting is very much
a core part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I say, content-driven creativity
and that really stems back to words more
[SPEAKER_00]: than anything else for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great amount of knowledge
to have behind the topic that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about today, because it's the one
thing I start to notice is that for as the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry advances and gets more mature,
the level of, let's say, content or
[SPEAKER_01]: intellect in the content needs to start
upgrading towards the likes of sportswear
[SPEAKER_01]: brands or retail brands that are putting
the amount of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was going to say, I think it's
definitely a symptom of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think absolutely the more interest there
is, the more you need to kind of stand
[SPEAKER_00]: out, the more you need to kind of
communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's still a big education
piece in cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very different from
technology in many respects, but whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: in tech, you have kind of like taking
smart people's ideas and kind of making
[SPEAKER_00]: them palatable to a business audience
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that stigma times 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about something that people,
a lot of people regard as bad drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got other people saying,
well, actually, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how can the same thing be?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, drugs, medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of stigmas to overcome
and a lot of different ways that people
[SPEAKER_00]: engage with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's that sort of job to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lots of people I speak to always have
a very touching, often personal story
[SPEAKER_00]: about why cannabis matters to them,
how it's improved their lives or the lives
[SPEAKER_00]: of a loved one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's hearing those stories and
helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the anecdotal evidence that helps
to educate people on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what content is really
good at doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is basically the first topic I
want to talk about now for entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into this industry or looking to
set up their own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, start off with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is copywriting and why is it
important for a brand, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's cannabis or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I copywriting essentially is,
you know, the written word in marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you have, you know,
people who write ads for TV might write
[SPEAKER_00]: scripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, I guess more and more over
the last sort of well, in my career,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of got into it at a time when there
was an opportunity, you know, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more digital communications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you start to see things like
websites and blogs, people using content
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing to differentiate their brand to
really, you know, differentiate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the kind of tone of voice to
kind of stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a whole industry around
SEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wouldn't get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's like trying to increase
your presence online as a brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: using content as a way to establish your
expertise, your tone of voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you want to engage with your
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you always have to have that
customer in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to read your content?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they going to find it useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we try to ask our clients and
people we work with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just about writing, you know,
something for your website is thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, who are your customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they going to find this industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: What value does this deliver?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about, you know, our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we do all these wonderful things
as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we sell, you know, zebras to,
you know, things like, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do people want to buy zebras?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important about the zebra industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, you know, being facetious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, who are you talking to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is what you can do a solution to their
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different ways you can
kind of spin that, you know, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: through web content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different ways that,
you know, that becomes relevant through
[SPEAKER_00]: different channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, talk about social media,
as well as websites, as well as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, through, I guess, conventional
media as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so much of it's online and
there's so many opportunities to use
[SPEAKER_00]: content to your advantage that any
business that isn't is really missing a
[SPEAKER_00]: trick, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they say in B2B, something
like you need seven different brand
[SPEAKER_00]: engagements for someone to start buying
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's different from, you know,
if you're selling a chocolate bar or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're selling something like a
piece of technology, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to need to know that they
could, you know, you know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, that they're buying into
something that is interesting and will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually help them, you know, do
everything from, you know, save them money
[SPEAKER_00]: or increase their efficiency, all those
sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that is what is at the
heart of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, same with cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess if you are in a kind of
B2B environment, if you're selling a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of machinery or something like that,
you need to not only talk about its
[SPEAKER_00]: features and benefits, but, you know,
what's the impact you're going to have for
[SPEAKER_00]: your customer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to, you know, make them more
money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to help them improve
efficiencies and put more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls through per hour or whatever it
might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and those are not necessarily the
interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing is that,
you know, the impact something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: will have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the story aspect comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of elements I see caught
up in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's like journalism,
but it's more of a kind of slant towards,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, selling stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to be as authentic as you
can in order to be thought of as credible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a big part of,
well, it's important for any business to
[SPEAKER_00]: be thought of as credible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think content, particularly in the
cannabis industry, where you've got so
[SPEAKER_00]: many restrictions around advertising and
marketing and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: using content to actually tell those
anecdotal stories can be a very powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you see over in North America any
agencies that seem to be excelling at this
[SPEAKER_01]: or is there a massive limit on what the
agencies can currently do on the market or
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you see so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not something I'm hugely
aware of what's happening in the US in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of their restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you look at the way in which,
for example, in Canada, sort of companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies, you know, you can't
have a kind of big fancy kind of packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: on the shelves, you know, you need to
have, you know, you have to have that big
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, it has to be sort of black,
it has to have a big yellow THC sticker on
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, how do you build a
brand with those sort of restrictions when
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't go on Instagram, for example,
you can't sort of openly advertise on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you navigate those sort of
restrictions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that a lot of
cannabis brands in, or in North America
[SPEAKER_00]: and beyond, you know, if you're trying to
build something, you're in danger of being
[SPEAKER_00]: basically shut down from, you know,
to a large part of your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that puts pressure on needing to use
other channels to, you know, demonstrate
[SPEAKER_00]: what your brand's about, or, you know,
and I think, again, trying to substantiate
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of health claims and things like
that, or that, you know, that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different kettle of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're talking about that,
you just need to be very mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, again, if you can tell
stories around it and use that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal rather than cast iron evidence
that, you know, and again, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's problems around research and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you demonstrate statistics or
demonstrate that something has a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: impact when you, you know, when there's no
research happening, or, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of speculating to a large
extent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no expert in that side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it comes back to, even if you
kind of think about the wider perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: on those sorts of restrictions from a
marketing perspective, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still do more with content than
you can in written content, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a kind of share of voice play than
using something visual and putting on a
[SPEAKER_00]: social media post and sort of,
you know, because, you know, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you really, when you think about
the broader perspective of a brand or
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and things like that,
it's, you know, it's about that full
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, full spectrum, you know,
I think there's a lot of parallels in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in so many different sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always love how cannabis seems to
be, you know, 15 different sectors just
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together and just clashing
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a little bit of,
oh, is it, can we advertise it in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way as we can farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it like alcoholic beverages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it like fast-moving consumer goods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it, you know, is it medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many kind of things,
you know, ways in which people understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it or don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's just about, you know,
reassuring your customers whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're selling flower oils or,
you know, vaping devices or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a way to illustrate that,
differentiate your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think through content, you know,
I'm, you know, I'm an advocate for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I just think there are so many
ways to leverage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have to answer the question,
but it gave, it gave me a sense of feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: like I know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually, it incorporated what I
wanted to move on to is how to build a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you said, copywriting is an
essential part of your brand building.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we start to see over in America,
especially the West Coast seemed to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of golf events, lemon haze of their
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've started to hear already about New
York, where they're like the rooftop
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis parties, sample parties are
already starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you see, when it happens in the UK,
a mix of events like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you always think the written word is
going to outdo any in-person event that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be held?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think you need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a kind of just broader approach
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, one of the things I
always constantly thinking about is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where's the kind of,
there needs to be some creativity in what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having restrictions sometimes
can really help to focus how you text
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how you can be creative
in marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it comes from having those
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the UK, I think because we have a
medical market, you know, it feels a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way from having a recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still that kind of, like I say,
the stigmas to overcome, to convince
[SPEAKER_00]: people that this is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people will have cannabis,
you know, recreationally, illegally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's going to happen
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what, in order to kind of give it more
legitimacy, we need to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate to patients or potential
patients as well as doctors that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and that there are different ways
to, you know, we need to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: education piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, again, content is perfect for
that education piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the kind of first piece
of the puzzle we need to address over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, organizations like
the MCCS, Professor Mike Barnes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hannah Deacon doing, making great strides
in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going around the UK and talking to
doctors directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been to one of their events and,
you know, they're giving these really
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent doctors cannabis 101,
not because they, you know, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: talking down to them, it's because the
knowledge just isn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, telling stories is about,
you know, understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the work of, you know,
organizations like PLE, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting people out there, you know,
it's still storytelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing, you know,
whether it's, you know, written content,
[SPEAKER_00]: in-person events, you know, you need to
have those stories heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something all kinds of
brands can have a, you know, have a hand
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I say, I feel like
every company that engages in the sector
[SPEAKER_00]: almost has to do that advocacy piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that those storytelling aspects is a
key part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's one of the same thing,
events, written content, social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all part of the same effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's that story aspect
that has to come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's how do we tell those
stories?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we manifest them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are we up against?
[SPEAKER_00]: How, again, we have the different contexts
in which we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that varies depending on the country,
but yeah, that's, that's kind of what's at
[SPEAKER_00]: the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need everything, basically,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a very informative episode
so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we finish up with the time we've
got, the election over the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's going to win it and who's going to
legalise cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, personally, I mean,
I think we need to change at the top for
[SPEAKER_00]: anything meaningful to happen from
cannabis perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, politicians are,
in my opinion, you never know what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, maybe the Tory party will
come along and say, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to kind of, you know, get the
economy back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's legalise cannabis recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's tax it and let's make a lot of money
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody to check out more of Dave's
