[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the latest episode of
the Cannabis of You.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this show
by Anna-Katharina Roper PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a Senior Special Consultant at the
Danish Technological Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for inviting me to the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to contribute with
some experience and knowledge from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Danish side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's exactly why you have your
armor on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a tour around Europe now to kind
of piece together who are the players in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most people who might not
understand that Denmark has a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise in cultivation and propagation,
new plant cultures and greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and plant breeding and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're a perfect person to bring on to
kind of talk about on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of how you got into the position
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in and into the medical cannabis
space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Into my position?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a PhD in Horticulture at Cape Hagen
University, and at that time I was already
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to DTI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I switched over the PhD to DTI to
continue working with plant breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture, where I was really excited
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we talk about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's the first topic we're going to
jump on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for most people who don't understand
the cannabis tissue protocols that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are working on up in Denmark,
can you give an overview of what a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tissue protocol is and how you
guys are advancing the industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tissue culture is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look to plant propagation,
you have two ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the classical one where you do
cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you cut a small part of a plant in a
greenhouse and it has no root and you put
[SPEAKER_01]: it on a substrate like soil and then it's
getting roots and it will be a new plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also use tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used since the 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you take plants in a different
environment, you can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take greenhouse material,
you make a sterilization of the surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you put it in small boxes and
they have some jelly-ish substrate in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this medium has different hormones
treating the plants and the way that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting roots, that it's growing,
that it has different behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have completely control about the
environment in this box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has a huge advantage because you
can direct the plant in the way you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, when you want to make mass
propagation, you have a hormone
[SPEAKER_01]: combination using a lot of side shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So small plants, you can also cut again
and then you put it in this new chamber
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the production, it's really
important that you have the medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: the basic substrate, which has the
nutrition for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have hormones who trigger the plant in
the way you would like to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And light is also a factor because it can
get stressed plants, but it can also
[SPEAKER_01]: induce something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the temperature, of course,
to introduce growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have different factors,
like tools you can use to modify the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's completely closed from the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the possibility to trigger the
plant as you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the things that I've
noticed as well, the large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody seems to think that it's going
to be important mass scale from South
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the process that you guys are coming
up with it allow for a European strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and various different territories around
Europe to have their own large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: production in the medical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's focus as a different
approaches and each company has their own
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see overall, there's a trend
to investigate tissue culture because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can also have a certain quality level
because when you have some tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have also control about pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, when you have a normal
cutting, you don't know what is inside
[SPEAKER_01]: before you have not a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really nice to have the tissue
culture for having pest control,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also to make a mass propagation for
small space, because otherwise you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of space for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the points of the quality of
the product and the time you can enlarge
[SPEAKER_01]: the production is really interesting also
for the Danish industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark has a well-established framework
for partnerships in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the next topic is
the importance of collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important do you see this topic being
and the ability to share the lab results
[SPEAKER_00]: across Europe to enhance the industry over
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely important to have
collaboration with different
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main cooperation is between the
science and the companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a long history that you
collaborate together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a classical university has
research projects with a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for our institute, from the Danish
Technology Institute as a GTS Institute,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have the role to support the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a classical team of universities
for the basic research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have us for the applied research,
bringing the knowledge to the industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry partner who's interested in
the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is really well supported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there's some different funding
systems where companies directly can get
[SPEAKER_01]: help from GTS institutes as our institute
is, where you can get some support from
[SPEAKER_01]: the state to develop new products,
optimize your production or explore new
[SPEAKER_01]: ways of setting up your production system,
where you get some financial support from
[SPEAKER_01]: the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the network.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have also a lot of focus in Denmark on
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of network groups and
arrangements that people can meet and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in Denmark, we also quite open
for international collaboration,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mean, there are a lot of people
out in the world that have experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have experience in growing and
greenhouse production, you can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: or inside in the closed systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also important to get some
knowledge about the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's really nicely to see that
there is a collaboration with abroad where
[SPEAKER_01]: countries will have experience with
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can give some insight, because I think
we have the view on things that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need to invest everything by ourselves if
it's already out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ireland is one of those countries
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our government kind of get up to speed
that we've got one of the best farming
[SPEAKER_00]: industries in the world over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain parts of this
industry that are already in place over in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland that just needs collaboration and
expertise from different territories to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to build a fully coherent industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last topic I wanted to talk to you
about was the Danish Technological
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that they've gotten so right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it first move?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the ability that they've already
been decades in innovation space and
[SPEAKER_00]: working with plant court culture like
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that a country like Ireland
could learn from what the DTI have done so
[SPEAKER_00]: well?
[SPEAKER_01]: The DTI has a really long history.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are more than 112 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since 112 years, we helping industry
partners to get innovative innovation done
[SPEAKER_01]: in their own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are really used to spot new industry
branches and spot where are some missing
[SPEAKER_01]: gaps, where we can fill it with knowledge
or can support this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do courses, we do technical support,
we do advising.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we touch from all different points,
you can say, of a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also in all different industry
grains from 3D print over building
[SPEAKER_01]: material or lottery advices and plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what you can learn from the
Danish model is that we are really close
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also like partner, you can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's we have long term relationships
over many years, where we hop in and out
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's needed, or we are constantly on
the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's really good to learn that
we are getting some close collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is also really a big point to
improve the work in the company,
[SPEAKER_01]: because for us, it's really important to
understand the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the business case?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the needs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we are helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also nice when they come back,
then we can reactivate that and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: can help further on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it seems we've talked to guys in
Malta already, and it seems the Malta
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprise boards are the people in Malta
who are doing the investing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: technological companies in the kind of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equivalent of that in Denmark is
the DTI, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there another enterprise board that
would assist in investment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does the cannabis industry all fall
within the DTI's realm over in Denmark?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I got the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a different government body that
works within the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark, or is it just the Danish
Technological Institute?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Danish Technological Institute is a
private research institute, you can see,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can also get some consultants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two phases, you can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Denmark, you need to have a
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone needs to have a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could always start and do some
tissue culture and do some experiments,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were allowed to handle with
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also the applied focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So universities, have also access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them, I think the final goal will
be that all of them have access.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a different focus on doing
research, doing publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our institute is focusing on the
industrial need and what is the focus of
[SPEAKER_01]: the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that there's a time and that we can
already start with developing protocols
[SPEAKER_01]: and make some strategy plans, how you
could support this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also am holding the now annual
medical cannabis symposium, which is again
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 8th of November, together with
Invest in Denmark, where we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward again to collecting the
whole medical cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're covering the whole value chain
from patient over product development over
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant materials, the resource for
everything, where we have talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, how you plant, how you produce
plants in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time is also partnership is a big
topic of collaboration, because we would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to enhance interdisciplinary research
that we can see in some countries that
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark can learn something where we have
project with doctors and plant producers,
[SPEAKER_01]: because sometimes the plant product is
already the end product you can get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be really valuable to have
some closer collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that day we are really looking forward
because we will combine again science and
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry that day to make a bridge
about as a knowledge transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's still definitely
gaps in the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody would be able to agree
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how quickly we advance those
gaps and close them and learn as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the term made in Denmark being
a critical component of a high grade
[SPEAKER_00]: product coming out of the country?
[SPEAKER_01]: The connection was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have just understood made in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we've noticed basically some of
the territories that are processing
[SPEAKER_00]: products for the medical cannabis industry
that made in Malta or made in Denmark
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be a tag or a slogan that will
certify an excellent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you noticing that in Denmark yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that's being talked
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So made in Denmark, I mean, in Denmark,
we have a long history of pharma products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have huge companies producing pharma,
yeah, medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see there's a huge tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this tradition has also value and we
have really strict lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get a product made in Denmark,
it has always a high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was not only medical cannabis,
which is new now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was we have a lot of designers of
furniture, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a huge quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the pharma industry with products
which have since many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decades products on high level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabis can definitely be in the
same level when you saw it made in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that as a selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been highly informative talking to
you and learning all about the Danish side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the industry from your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for joining the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we get to talk again in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all we want is a welcome for our
international symposium, where we say
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome online and physical on the 8th of
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8th of November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a website for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'll put it out on the link with
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will send you the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put all the details for everybody to
check in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again very much, Anna-Katrina.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great day and we'll chat to you
again very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
