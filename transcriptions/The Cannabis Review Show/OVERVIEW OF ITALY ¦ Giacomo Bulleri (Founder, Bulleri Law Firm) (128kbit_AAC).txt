[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Giacomo Bulleri, who's the founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bulleri Law Firm in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Giacomo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thank you all for your invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody an
overview of how you came to found your own
[SPEAKER_00]: law firm and your position in the industry
at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I work as advisor for EIA,
the European Industrial Health
[SPEAKER_01]: Association, and for the Cannabis Italian
National Association, as well as advisor
[SPEAKER_01]: for some companies who are interested to
develop their business here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you maybe want to jump onto the
first topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had a number of guests from
around Europe and we've been able to piece
[SPEAKER_00]: together a picture of various different
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you maybe give us an overview of
what's happening in Italy when it regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cannabis industry, both medical and
adult use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that the situation in Italy
is a little bit complicated, as everything
[SPEAKER_01]: in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially in the hemp sector,
we are making progress in two directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the Ministry of Agriculture is
defining the sector plan for hemp with the
[SPEAKER_01]: trade associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an important step because it will
be based on the concept of the whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: as an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will allow farmers to grow and process
the whole plant for legal purpose under
[SPEAKER_01]: Law 242 of 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is very important because it
guarantees the agricultural part and is in
[SPEAKER_01]: line with the concept of the whole plant
approach, also promoted by UNTAD,
[SPEAKER_01]: the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, we are waiting for the
consequence of the Tarlazio, the Italian
[SPEAKER_01]: Administrative Court, the ruling that
annulled the part of the Ministry decree
[SPEAKER_01]: on medicinal plants that limit its use to
seeds and derivatives only.
[SPEAKER_01]: This called for the development of the
sector for the farmers who cultivate in
[SPEAKER_01]: GACP, according to the European procedure,
who will first be able to grow them and
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer them into anti-essential oils and
then supply the product to herbalists and
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacists who will be able to make
galactic preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the Ministry of Health will
not agree on this scenario, but all that
[SPEAKER_01]: remains is to wait for the ruling to
become final next September.
[SPEAKER_01]: For adult use is according to the question
of political choice and political will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in Italy, I think there is not a
real political will to proceed in the way
[SPEAKER_01]: of the regulation of the adult use of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the medical cannabis is a question who
don't present real problem under the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory law aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real problem of supply because here
in Italy, the possibility, the growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all just for the army.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are waiting for a partnership
between army and the private companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the way is far because we need to work
and on the training of the doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if the doctors don't prescribe
cannabis, the pharmacy don't sell and
[SPEAKER_01]: there is not a real business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward, we're making important
steps for hemp, not for adult use,
[SPEAKER_01]: not really for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very, very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a territory or does Spain
have a large output of hemp grown every
[SPEAKER_00]: year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it one of the biggest producers in
Europe or is it still a small industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Italy is a country with big possibilities,
but we need to take an example,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, from the North American,
for example, market for the less
[SPEAKER_01]: bureaucratic liberalist approach to the
innovative sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are fighting again in this situation
here in Italy, but we are step by step
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward, especially to avoid a
situation of overproduction in the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: sector as in another country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are working in progress too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as other countries in the hemp and
cannabis sector, we are solving some
[SPEAKER_01]: problems through the court and through the
state in the court.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and in over in Italy, do they have we
see around Europe, there's lots of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: stores that sell CBD flour and HHC and
some of them with Deltate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they available in Italy or are they
just not around at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's the other end of the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in the one hand, we are talking about
the step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the other hand, there are still
gray areas for CBD flowers here in Italy,
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called cannabis light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, where is a sector where there are
different interpretations from case to
[SPEAKER_01]: case and from area to area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a municipality near, closer,
can be happens that in a town there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal trial and in another town there
is not a criminal trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that the outcome of the criminal
trial in Parma against Mr. Luca Marola,
[SPEAKER_01]: the founder of his joint, will be decisive
for media attention and the political
[SPEAKER_01]: weight of this trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I think that this outcome could
be could help us the CBD flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation, because the CBD flowers must
be must find a clear position as an
[SPEAKER_01]: inhalation product.
[SPEAKER_01]: As in Belgium, Luxembourg or in
Switzerland, because I don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: Italy can continue to sell this product as
a ornamental product or for just for
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting because this is not a big
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a business just for a little
companies and not for bigger companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not good for investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not clarity and certainly no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they have any rough estimates of
what the medical cannabis market size is?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people in the country are open to
possibly subscribe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is there is there market data for
the adult use market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it five percent of the population?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you have a rough idea on that
figure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because because I think that we need to
create this market to in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to start and began from the
training of the doctors and for
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if doctors prescribe very few yet
cannabis, pharmacy don't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a pharmacy don't sell, don't buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pharmacy don't buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not a real market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to work on training of doctors
to training and distribution, because
[SPEAKER_01]: without training, there is not a real
distribution in Italy now in the in one
[SPEAKER_01]: hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, I see this is my
personal opinion that we can start to
[SPEAKER_01]: import some API, some product,
because we have yet some little regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: problems who limit the possibility to
create a vertical facility from the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: until the final product, especially for
the extract GMP extract for pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be an intermediate situation
where some API are imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: From other member states, because we need
the EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are working on it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you find that there's any reports
and data sets in Europe that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: realistically have projected the size of
both the CBD side and the HHC and the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical size market and gotten a rough
valuation on a country by country basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that it's all the
information is not exact?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that as I also explained in
the working groups, a European and
[SPEAKER_01]: national level where I participate,
the solution must be unified at European
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a simple, a single, sorry,
a single, a single approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we must avoid a two speed Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where some countries can freely produce
and sell a whole plant of cannabis and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: products and other countries where the
same product cannot be produced and sell
[SPEAKER_01]: it because the situation only creates
damage to the business and distortion of
[SPEAKER_01]: the common market organization and the
market competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the countries as Mediterranean
countries, as Italian, in Spain with the
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive regulations will find
themselves in the position of being
[SPEAKER_01]: subject to the import of the same buying
of products due to the effect of the free
[SPEAKER_01]: movement of goods with the damage only to
the national producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if in Italy you can't produce
tea with leaves, but you can import the
[SPEAKER_01]: same products from Austria or from
Croatia, and this is a situation we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to resolve it to avoid a two speed Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our problem in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, at the European
level, the work is spending and the main
[SPEAKER_01]: and the relevant direction general,
DG Agri, DG Santé and DG Grow are working
[SPEAKER_01]: on their respective papers on cosmetic,
on the feed, on the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are working on the human use and
the human destination because the real
[SPEAKER_01]: game is played in Europe, not in the
single member states because we know there
[SPEAKER_01]: are member states with extensive
interpretation with temporary framework
[SPEAKER_01]: that already all produced and sell it for
CBD products as France, Poland,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there is a complicated and particular
situation where it's not possible to
[SPEAKER_01]: obtain a real registration as food
supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a similar procedure of
notifying procedure that allows to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD products in some countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to avoid this situation where
some countries can freely produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: other where the same products cannot be
produced and sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one last thing before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the core case that's
happening in Italy in Parma that's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically got to determine the next kind
of stage of what the industry looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one in Ireland as well,
as I'm sure you're aware that some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies have core cases against our
government and that case is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine how the industry in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a case of all these different single
countries in the European Union?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they have their laws overruled by the
European Commission, no matter what they
[SPEAKER_00]: do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there always going to be this
fragmented framework if everybody doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get inside with the exact same laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a matter very, very important
that the national courts are applying the
[SPEAKER_01]: European law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Italy, the Torlazio Italian
Administrative Court, the French State
[SPEAKER_01]: Council are stated that the European law
prevails on national rules because
[SPEAKER_01]: national rules that are
[SPEAKER_01]: against the European law, for example,
against the use of the wall plant are
[SPEAKER_01]: against the produce quantitative
restriction that is forbidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this principle are stated as already
stated from the European Court of Justice
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2003, the first time against Sweden in
the Hammerstein case and recently in 2020
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Cannavale case.
[SPEAKER_01]: The statement of the European Court of
Justice are the point of reference of the
[SPEAKER_01]: national court and for European Commission
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's working, this paper,
the European Commission are working on
[SPEAKER_01]: aligning the single destination of use
regulation with the interpretation stated
[SPEAKER_01]: by the European Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the situation now in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gio Coma, I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our time is up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let you go and get home for
your house after a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I very much appreciate you taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
