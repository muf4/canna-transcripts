[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined by Christina
Daman, partner at ICE Miller, a leading
[SPEAKER_01]: law firm based in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today, Christina?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here and thanks for
having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohio is a hot topic in the global world of
cannabis at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What better than to get the top law firm
on to give us their perspective on one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two different issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick overview and 60 seconds of your
[SPEAKER_01]: position at your firm and how you guys end
up touching against cannabis legislation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a partner in our housing, our
litigation group, but I have a crossover
[SPEAKER_00]: practice that works very, very closely
with our regulatory attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our firm first got involved with
cannabis law writ large here in Columbus,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio, when Ohio legalized medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with a number of early operators
to apply for those licenses and secure
[SPEAKER_00]: those licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either through the regulatory process or
through eventual litigation, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I played a prominent role with
respect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's been off to the races ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're based over here in Ireland,
and as I'm sure you've seen over in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, the social media activity around
Ohio and what happened over there seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the message is definitely not the same
across all platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of what happened in Ohio?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the reason to celebrate and what
does it mean for the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm sure everyone is aware,
this is probably an easy fact to confirm
[SPEAKER_00]: that Ohio has legalized medical cannabis
sales and it's only accessible to patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that receive recommendations from doctors
for the use of medical cannabis pursuant
[SPEAKER_00]: to a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the case for several years and
it's become a mature market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a series of dispensaries that
are coming online as we speak over the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few months there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, the legislature combined
what was an over several oversight
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies to have the oversight agency be
under the Ohio Department of Commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now all of Ohio is regulated through
one regulator, which sets us up well for
[SPEAKER_00]: our current stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as everyone that is listening here,
I'm sure has heard Ohio is legalized adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does that actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as of last Tuesday after the
election on what was called issue two,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio passed what was an initiated statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: An initiated statute is a unique feature
here in Ohio that allows for citizens to
[SPEAKER_00]: put together an entire chapter of what is
the Ohio revised code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is a literal chapter of the Ohio
revised code that sets out all the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters concerning adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's extremely detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes the licensing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes certain prohibitions
concerning the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes certain protections concerning
the program, as well as safe harbors for
[SPEAKER_00]: financial institutions and employers to
make certain decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why I kind of get into that detail
right away is because this was not a writ
[SPEAKER_00]: large.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've legalized cannabis and anyone can
sell, anyone can buy, anyone can consume
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is it is part of a regulated structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it stands today, it actually isn't
even effective under the Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: An initiated statute becomes effective in
30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it stands today, it is still
technically not legal to possess and use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effective date of the statute is
December seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's at that point when consumption
and use becomes legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you yet will be able to purchase any
adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to just give you that quick
overview as to the exact snapshot on where
[SPEAKER_00]: we are right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always like getting to the facts of any
issue and not listen to just people who
[SPEAKER_01]: have a vested interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe tell me when it comes to the
7th of December, the is there an
[SPEAKER_01]: application process that's going to start
from the 7th of December for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, logistics and the various
different ancillary businesses that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to serve this sector to apply for
licenses that would cover them under this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it stands under the current
structure, the new Division of Campus
[SPEAKER_00]: Control, which is created by this statute
that is under the Department of Commerce,
[SPEAKER_00]: will have to create what are the
regulations that govern the statutory
[SPEAKER_00]: provisions that are in the initiated
statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first step, in fact, before even a
license process can commence, is the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations have to be published.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go through the notice and
comment period and then be adopted before
[SPEAKER_00]: they can proceed with the applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are set parameters within the
statute that requires the Division of
[SPEAKER_00]: Campus Control to prepare those in short
order and to in short order thereafter
[SPEAKER_00]: begin accepting applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it relates to those
applications, because this is I think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: key component, the way that the current
statute is structured is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: contemplates that all of the current
medical operators that are licensed will
[SPEAKER_00]: have the right to secure an adult use
license for the like operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ohio has four major types of licenses,
the cultivation license, the processing
[SPEAKER_00]: license, the lab license and the
dispensary license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as it stands under the current
statute, each of those license holders
[SPEAKER_00]: will have the right to secure in addition
to their medical cannabis license and
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use cannabis license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right then, the cultivators can
sell to the processors and the processors
[SPEAKER_00]: can sell to the dispensaries in the adult
use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is also a component that
contemplates an additional round of
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses that specifically are geared
towards social equity candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that program will be run initially
through what's a certification process
[SPEAKER_00]: under what is the Ohio Department of
Development, which oversees all of
[SPEAKER_00]: business certifications along those same
lines, like a minority business
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprise, for example, or a women
business enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once that's certification process is
created and businesses are certified,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the application process can commence
as to those applicants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one final piece on this is every
two years under the medical program,
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory body is told to review and
assess whether there needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: additional licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same concept is employed here in the
adult use program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every two years, the program is
intended to analyze whether the market is
[SPEAKER_00]: being, market needs are being met,
or if the market needs are not being met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's the latter, then the,
and this has actually occurred in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis program, open up,
they'll open up the licenses for
[SPEAKER_00]: additional applications and additional
entry into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the medical program, for example,
I mentioned just a few minutes ago that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are dispensaries that are turning
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are from that two year review,
determining that their patient population
[SPEAKER_00]: could support additional dispensary
companies throughout the state of Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredibly detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next topic I wanted to move on to was what
can we expect in the United States newest
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use market is the ability to sell
beverages and food products within the
[SPEAKER_01]: realm of the legislation that they
proposed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see which side of the industry
you see being the dominant player in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future part of the Ohio sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ohio is a control state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a control state as it relates to the
medical cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be similarly controlled as it
relates to the adult use program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it stands, and as it's contemplated
today, the program does not have,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, a feature like a consumption
lounge, like we've seen in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is limited to sale at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are provisos within the statute that
allow landowners to prohibit consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: within their premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as, as it relates to the
residential landowners to prohibit what is
[SPEAKER_00]: a home grow component of the program,
which is a feature that we haven't yet
[SPEAKER_00]: chatted about because we were focused on
the licensing, but home grow is just
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for grow of cannabis plants in
any individual's home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the board with the program,
you have to be 21 and older, including
[SPEAKER_00]: with the home grow component of the
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are permitted to have each adult
within a household to grow up to six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each household can have up to 12
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just your, you know,
home garden where you're planting your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be in a secure area,
whether inside or outside of the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be secure such that it
cannot be accessible to children or anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who is not of the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there brands that already exist in
Ohio when it comes to, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: the CHHC and the Delta 8 side of the
industry that are going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: translate into this adult use market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see the big brands from other
larger states coming in and influencing
[SPEAKER_01]: the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question because Ohio,
it has a separate hemp program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll kind of set that aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great topic for a separate webinar to go
through large United States on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that this statute is written
is it's an attempt to be comprehensive
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding the sale of any product that may
contain THC, whether it be Delta 8,
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 9, Delta 10, any of the variations
thereof, as well as the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the intent is, is that any sale would
be through one of these licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the state of Ohio right now,
we have a number of kind of marquee
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are, you know, that are
very successful, some of which are Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of homegrown, some of which are in
partnerships with companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them are other companies
in other states that have come into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio market to participate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is the gambit at the end of
the day, which is exciting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's a control state,
there's in fact a cap on the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a cap on the number of licenses
you can hold within kind of those four
[SPEAKER_00]: categories I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, labs need to be independent,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot also be affiliated with a
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ohio has one of the best testing
programs in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten extremely positive reviews
across the board, which is very exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: and something that I personally am very
proud of with respect to the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it relates to the cultivators,
you can only own one as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it relates to the
dispensaries, currently you can only own
[SPEAKER_00]: up to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the adult use proposal, you can have
up to eight, which makes sense because the
[SPEAKER_00]: market's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be a bigger demand when you
factor in the adult use market in addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recently had a citizen assembly here in
Ireland where we missed out on legal adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use market by one vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was a piece of advice that you
could give to territories that are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to open up this market from the activism
side of the thing all the way up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal side of the thing, what is the one
lesson that you think could be learned
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Ohio process that everybody else
could take away?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that you asked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting together the statute was not a
simple task and it was not done by one
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done by listening to interest
groups, to operators, to regulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: to Ohioans to understand what makes sense
for what is Ohio today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my piece of advice would be to
understand you can't have everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the initiated statute was
very beautiful because you could integrate
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of different components but at the
end of the day, it did not integrate every
[SPEAKER_00]: single component that you've seen in every
single market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a balancing act that went
in in order to address each of the voices
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that Ohioans, when they went
to vote on Tuesday, felt confident that
[SPEAKER_00]: this was something that would be something
that they would like to see in their
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems to be regardless of the
territory, it's the political persuasion
[SPEAKER_01]: of the voter that needs to be appealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to be palatable for that voter,
whether they swing whichever way left or
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right, in part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've seen really an interesting
dynamic with the vote this last week in
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a lot of bipartisan support
with respect to adult use cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually was one of the
instigating pieces to even go down this
[SPEAKER_00]: path, which, by the way, started over two
years ago as it related to this specific
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated statute, was that Ohioans just
overwhelmingly supported it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would have had to have been
something that crossed party lines because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the current affiliation structure or
affiliated kind of dynamic we have here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been incredibly fascinating talking
to you, Christina, your wealth of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that you're looking
forward to seeing over the next 12 months
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Ohio industry come to fruition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing
its continued growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been a slow and steady growth
and these next 12 months are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really looking forward to it and just
keep in mind some of our key dates are
[SPEAKER_00]: leading into next year and then toward the
end of next year as the program rolls out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who's looking for a top law
firm in Ohio, Ice Miller's website is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be below and in all the
descriptions you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also check out more about
Christina and her special skill set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Christina,
for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we get to touch base in
about nine months, 10 months time and we
[SPEAKER_01]: can see everything's been knocked out of
the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: By Ohio and they're leading the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll be reporting live from a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a great weekend and thank you
very much for taking your time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
