[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Nicholas Milne, who's the co-founder and
[SPEAKER_00]: CSO at Danish based company Octarine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Nicholas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody an
overview of your position in your sector
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you guys came about to found
Octarine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my background is and my co-founder's
background is in yeast fermentation and
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic biology, which basically means
we engineer the genome of yeast to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: new and interesting compounds by
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically it's a kin, I don't know if
you know, but the yeast is this
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganism that makes beer and wine and
bread and all these wonderful things we
[SPEAKER_01]: know and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by playing around with this genome,
you can get it to produce other
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting compounds basically in the
same apparatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our fermentation process looks very,
very similar to a process you'd see at a
[SPEAKER_01]: brewery or at a drug manufacturing
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do differently is we get that
yeast to produce compounds that it
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't natively produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work within the psychedelics value
chain to manufacture psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of difficulties in extracting
psychedelics from their native host,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly psilocybin from mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms aren't the easiest organism to
cultivate and particularly they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to standardize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see fermentation is this really nice
middle ground where we can get all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability benefits of fermentation,
but we can offer a much more consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: and stable supply of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And importantly, cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big advantages of yeast
fermentation is the cost that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce these molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a rough input, we're aiming
for to be able to develop or to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP grade psilocybin for dollars per gram
and perhaps even lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cost benefits are really,
really significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, can we maybe break down the difference
between using fermentation and
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis for cannabinoids and for
psilocybin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously psilocybin, let's start with
first, the quantity of psilocybin per
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom or per plant is not replicable
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So large scale cultivation is not really a
solution for large scale drug discovery
[SPEAKER_00]: and development, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just argue that it's not very
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as just a rough example, psilocybin
producing mushrooms, they produce
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin in the range of about one
percent dry mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem, though, is that on top of
producing psilocybin, these mushrooms also
[SPEAKER_01]: produce a range of structurally related
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the intermediates byproducts,
degradation products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from a purification point of view,
you have to invest a lot of additional
[SPEAKER_01]: resources to separate your compound,
which in this case is psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the myriad of other structurally
related compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does add a further complication
step.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also I mean, and you know this,
if you go to the supermarket and buy
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, mushrooms are hardy creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have this tough outer layer,
very difficult to kind of burst open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to invest a lot of
resources in order to get the psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast with our fermentation method,
our yeast, it grows sensationally well in
[SPEAKER_01]: large scale fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It simply secretes the psilocybin into the
surrounding media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a purification point of view,
that's much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think most importantly, our strains,
they only produce psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce nothing else that even looks
remotely similar to psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a purification point of view,
that also makes it considerably easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can pretty much say the future
of this ingredient side of both psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: and rare cannabinoids is going to be
fermentation for the environmental impact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has, the scalability it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, the dollars per gram
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see this over the next 10 years
being the dominant player when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: this side of the ingredient market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is how we see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeast fermentation is used to produce
already a surprising number of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients in your daily lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used to make that vaccines,
pharmaceutical drugs, used to make food
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients, biofuels, bioplastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already out there in surprisingly
large quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the area where it hasn't quite
penetrated to the extent as other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries is in small molecule
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see this as an emerging application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked at psychedelics,
psychedelic, the industry is being built
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly from the ground up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not an existing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being built from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this as a really good way to
incorporate sustainability from the outset
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of having to develop an
unsustainable industry and later go in and
[SPEAKER_01]: improve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see an opportunity to use that from the
get go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see fermentation as the most
realistic way of achieving this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let me move on to the cannabinoid
side of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, everybody knows about CVD and
THC as the most prominent cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we all know that there's over 120 plus
cannabinoids now when it comes to those
[SPEAKER_00]: rare cannabinoids that are available only
in a minute percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the same process applied to psilocybin,
or is there a different technique that's
[SPEAKER_00]: used to extract these rare molecules that
are at small scales?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, the story is very similar,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis plant produces 120 different
compounds, most of them in incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: minute amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you gain access to those?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a key difference is that
cannabinoids and psilocybin are
[SPEAKER_01]: notoriously complicated molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that they're biosynthesized is
extremely complex and far more complex
[SPEAKER_01]: than most people realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually as a production system,
the cannabis plant is, in our opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the most efficient way to get
your hands on these molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've seen in the last few years
is that we've seen in particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding techniques allowing us to gain
access to some of these more rare
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in contrast to psychedelics,
we actually see plant-derived
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, and particularly of rare
plant-derived cannabinoids, as actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being the major driver of the cannabinoid
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we fit into this value chain is,
so we don't have an interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think the plant is doing a fantastic
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap, it's readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem we see with cannabinoids is
their properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody who's worked with cannabinoids
knows that issues around their solubility,
[SPEAKER_01]: their stability, and particularly their
bioavailability are really rate-limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually what we're doing in this
industry is we're using fermentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and again, sustainable bio-based
approaches, to convert natural
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids into new and improved
compounds with these improved properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this very simple
fermentation-based method, we produce
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that are fully water-soluble,
are extremely stable, and have very high
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this combination as really the
way forward where the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: produces the molecules, we improve them,
and that's the product that makes it to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear a lot of talk about the full
spectrum effect of all the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from a plant together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the future of this industry,
if we're able to biosynthesize molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: individually, creating new formulations
that may not necessarily already exist in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, but are more advantageous for
whether it's inflammation or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: ailment it may be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we do see this talked about a
lot, the idea that multiple cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and perhaps even cannabinoids and the
terpenes synergistically work together to
[SPEAKER_01]: have an improved effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that definitely seems to be something
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we talk about things like
full spectrum versus individual compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's more of a reflection that
we don't fully understand how all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different molecules work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so until we really understand that,
the strategy is just to mix everything
[SPEAKER_01]: together and assume that they will all
work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that we see it is that in the
future, I think we'll understand in much
[SPEAKER_01]: more detail how specific cannabinoids
interact together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do see formulations where perhaps
it's a mix of two cannabinoids and maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene that gives overwhelmingly the
therapeutic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having to mix 100 different
cannabinoids together, you can just mix
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three perhaps with a terpene and
that is your therapeutic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys at Octoring work on your own
formulations or are you singly just
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on distribution?
[SPEAKER_00]: We create the molecules and we bring them
to companies who then work on formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a big need and a big want to get
into the formulation creating side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're firmly a business to business
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work with consumer brands,
but also pharmaceutical companies or drug
[SPEAKER_01]: development companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: To advance products made by fermentation
down the value chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of something like
psychedelics, we would work mainly with
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies to take lead
candidates into the clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the cannabinoid side, we work with
consumer brands who are really looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: specific cannabinoids to get into consumer
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, consumer facing company A
might be really interested in a water
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble version of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumer company B might be really
interested in CBD and we develop the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing process to get those
products into market.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is the teeter amount when it
comes to the competition between other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in your market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it is a case of whoever gets the
highest grams per liter per hour is the
[SPEAKER_00]: winner of the race or is there a scale of
purity that can that can be more
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous than going for the higher
quantities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so at the end of the day,
cost of goods is the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: parameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does it cost to produce a
kilogram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Teeter is a really important aspect of
that, but it's by far not the only
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we consider yeah, so Teeter is a really
big thing, but actually the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: factor when it comes to cost is the cost
to purify.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do I have to invest to separate
my molecule of interest from the sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: complex fermentation broth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I think is where at least in our
point of view is where most of the R&D
[SPEAKER_01]: investment is put in how to purify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is choosing the correct substrate a
difficult task or is it the same for most
[SPEAKER_00]: companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, so sugar is by far the most
commonly used bulk ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly cheap, particularly
compared to the cost of the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're producing psilocybin at dollars
per gram, glucose is cents per gram and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even a little bit less than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that at least on the
psychedelic side, not many companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking more complicated than just adding
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of cannabinoids, I actually
think it's a little more complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, producing cannabinoids is
notoriously difficult and producing it
[SPEAKER_01]: from glucose or other sugars is actually
complicated as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that many other companies are
using sort of intermediates of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthetic pathway, so things like
hexanoic acid, which is more expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: than glucose, but it does make the
production process more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the biosynthesis of
cannabinoids, is everybody starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: all of phthalic acid and tyrannophous
phosphite and combining those for CBGA or
[SPEAKER_00]: is there an easy entry point to start with
THC or CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD and THC are for the most part the
end of the biosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not that many things you can
convert these cannabinoids into.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few degradation products and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first sort of common intermediate is
either hexanoic acid or in the case of
[SPEAKER_01]: producing them, the kind of big three THC,
CBD and CBD, CBG, THC, then olive phthalic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid is kind of the starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever you start, there is a cost factor
to consider, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Glucose is cheapest, hexanoic acid is more
expensive, olive phthalic acid is more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really determines where your cost of
goods comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the goal of synthetic biology is
always to produce complex molecules from
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very simple starting substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any synthetic biologist always prefers
to start from glucose or something similar
[SPEAKER_01]: like that as the starting point,
because that's always going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheapest process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there are difficulties with the
biosynthetic pathway, like in the case of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, then an alternative could be
something like one of the intermediates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we be right in saying that the
future, especially in Europe, of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient side of whether it's food and
beverage and cannabis or beauty and makeup
[SPEAKER_00]: or drug discovery development is going to
be led by the biotechnology companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: the scalability and ability to just
extract from plant matter won't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: compete?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really has to be taken on a
case by case basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, as a synthetic biologist,
we wished we lived in a world where we
[SPEAKER_01]: could out compete every other process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are many examples where plants
are just cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think you can just apply a
one size fits all approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to look at the individual
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at the market that it's
being applied to and really holistically
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the best way of bringing that
product to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases, the plant wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that for cannabis, that the
plant is going to win over any other
[SPEAKER_01]: technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are many other cases with
different molecules that makes financial
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to go for something like yeast
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely fascinating talking
to you, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we could have a longer episode,
but we're nearly at our 15 minutes time
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who hasn't ever checked out
Octarine, I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is below and it'll be in all
the descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, Nick, thank you very much for
your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
