[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Daniel Levinson, who's the founder at
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlas Cannath Consulting based in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Daniel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give everybody a little
overview of how you came from property in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York to founding Atlas Cannath
Consulting and being based out of Israel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, born and bred in New York,
grew up there and moved here to Israel
[SPEAKER_01]: about six years ago at the age of 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: After being involved in property
development and real estate investing in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, I jumped in with seeing
everything going on in the CBD space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to jump in and get involved with
CBD sales in the UK, Europe, and the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Israel, decided to get more
involved in the industry, work for an
[SPEAKER_01]: investment fund for a brief period as a
consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing deal flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, opened Atlas Cannath
Consultants to help some of the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: with new market entry opportunities and
fundraising and business development in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we maybe jump on to the first topic of
conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about which is basically an
overview of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all hear a lot of information about the
R&D side of things that since the 60s or
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s, you guys have kind of been at the
forefront of this scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to break down for
everybody, what does the Israeli industry
[SPEAKER_00]: look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the most prominent sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it biotechnology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it medical R&D?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw there that Philip Morris recently
acquired an inhaler company that were
[SPEAKER_00]: based out of Israel as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Israel, we have quite the
experience with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, Dr. Rafael Mishalem, who recently
passed away, unfortunately, but having
[SPEAKER_01]: first isolated CBD and THC as independent
compounds and research in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, we've had a lot of experience
in the R&D side of things from clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials to delivery devices, as you saw
with the psych inhaler, just getting an
[SPEAKER_01]: investment from Philip Morris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I think what's shining is the
industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a medical program since the
early 2000s for patients being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: access medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have many local cultivators as well as
importers and brands that have entered the
[SPEAKER_01]: market here in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 120,000 patients to date on
average receiving about 30 grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis per month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each patient needs their prescription from
their personalized doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen just a lot of opportunity in
that respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: With brands looking to enter the Israeli
market, and that's really where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to stick our feet and really help
brands come to Israel and help them
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate the regulation and the market as
a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that Israel is a hotbed
for starters, especially in the tech
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the capital access for companies who
are starting in this industry or looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to expand on a global footprint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the access capital there in the Israeli
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has its stigmas attached to it,
like in every market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capital is definitely drying up in the
cannabis space and specifically here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel compared to the tech sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely harder to access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as many investors feel comfortable
with the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies go public in the past number of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have I'd say about five or six of our
companies listed here on the Tel Aviv
[SPEAKER_01]: Stock Exchange as well as other exchanges
such as the NASDAQ and the CSE.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an issue in the more in the
broader medical cannabis market,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just here in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: An issue of access to capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be that regulations and rules
are exactly where prime investors want
[SPEAKER_00]: them to be just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you imagine that federal legalization
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: will spur on the Israeli industry like it
will Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being as I'm from New York and having many
contacts and industry relationships out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S., seeing markets like California,
Colorado, being there in person,
[SPEAKER_01]: watching them go from medical to
recreational and now in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: just spending about two months in New York
just a few months ago, seeing the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities that lie in the regulated
adult use markets is definitely something
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some clarity and regulation in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that will definitely trickle out
as here in Israel we're a pretty small
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are 10 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to look at New Jersey as
[SPEAKER_01]: for analysis purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being as I'm from New York and the
recently adult use legalization over
[SPEAKER_01]: there, we are definitely looking forward
to that trickling out into the European
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do believe Israel will head that way in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was over in Tel Aviv myself personally
in June and I was actually surprised at
[SPEAKER_00]: how many people were smoking cannabis in
public and there didn't seem to be any
[SPEAKER_00]: real pushback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Tel Aviv more of an outlier when it
comes to Israel or is this tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: widespread across the country?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have passed decriminalization here in
Israel about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where now if you're caught smoking and
holding up to a certain amount,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will just get a fine at the end of the
day and up to three strikes I believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here it's not just Tel Aviv,
it's all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a large constituent of adults
between the ages of 18 and up who can be
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming alcohol legally, who are drafted
into the military at the age of 18 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing cannabis just open up its
doors to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being as we're a Middle Eastern country,
the cultural attachment to smoking is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely relevant to this conversation
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they say around 20 to 25% of
adults between 18 and 60 have used
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have a large kind of black market
or grey market and people who will dabble
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of big companies coming out
of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked to Ilan Sobel from Bio Harvest
Sciences as we mentioned the deal that got
[SPEAKER_00]: Philip Morris.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the tip of the spear when it comes
to the Israeli industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it technology applied to the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it biotechnology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it medical R&D?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the strongest part of
the Israeli cannabis scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: To date, being as we're dealing with
cannabis and it's treated as a narcotic
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Israel, we do have a lot of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as a pharmaceutical that it's
being treated as, we do have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation and hoops and ways we need to
drive any devices that are used in
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery of this medicine is considered a
medical device.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to go through classic medical
device
[SPEAKER_01]: approvals with the Ministry of Health and
as we see psyche medical going for
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hoops and hurdles that we're
experiencing are definitely very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're seeing a large push on the
consumer side and the marketing and
[SPEAKER_01]: branding of these medical brands that are
coming to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do believe in the future that
there's a lot of R&D and a lot of more
[SPEAKER_01]: pharma focused companies that will come to
the forefront as clinical trials become
[SPEAKER_01]: more prevalent in the cannabis industry
and people start really focusing on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharma and medical side of this plant as
opposed to where we have it now,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is this quasi medical slash adult
use conversation where we're not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: down to the real values of where we could
be bringing this plant both in the adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use aspect as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the pharma approach, which I strongly
believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's a huge value in that
side of the industry and those people who
[SPEAKER_00]: can create formulations and blends of
terpenes and cannabinoids and imply them
[SPEAKER_00]: to whether it's CB1 or CB2 receptors or
inflammation or chronic pain, whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the big leap that's going
to happen in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: globally over the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think unfortunately we're
missing a little bit of that due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hurdles that we're experiencing as an
industry among the different markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do believe in the next five to 10
years, we will start to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: biotech companies and a lot of these,
we have a very well known terpene company
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Israel, Ibne, with botanical
terpenes that are really leading the way
[SPEAKER_01]: in R&D around the terpenes and the effects
that it could have along with CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's benefits to patients that
have yet to be re-brought to market and
[SPEAKER_00]: showcased as of yet and I think that's
where the most exciting part is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the future plans for Atlas kind of
consulting and is there anything that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to tell the audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're continuing helping companies
look into Israel as a market opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are actively pursuing capital on behalf
of different companies as well and trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to look into Europe as Australia,
the emerging markets and really try to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect the dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself being from North America and the
US, really I think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities between Canada and what's
been done in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US wants federal regulation exists,
let alone legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe becoming the market that we all
know it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe there's a large
opportunity in connecting the dots and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's our goal at Atlas Canada Consulting
is really to help companies connect the
[SPEAKER_01]: dots in new markets, whether it's
fundraising, finding distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at JV opportunities to help
further the market and help develop the
[SPEAKER_01]: market as we're in this growth stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little painful, of course,
during this time, but I do believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: the coming years where things will start
shining again and investment capital will
[SPEAKER_01]: start coming back and we'll really see the
cannabis industry really develop into what
[SPEAKER_01]: we know it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry, the quagmire that
everybody's in at the moment is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of some of the people who are just
here for a quick book and I think the next
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five years you'll see the real
professionals come into this industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: stay in this industry and they'll be the
ones that will be able to foresee the
[SPEAKER_00]: future growth of this sector globally,
not just locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helping the brands carry through and the
real market makers will start to emerge
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're here to help along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, speaking of that, we look forward to
bringing the Canada Summit to Tel Aviv
[SPEAKER_00]: next year and look forward to working with
you on that and hope to see you in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brussels in October if you can make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is up now for Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just very much appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was great and we're looking forward
to having you guys here in Tel Aviv very
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
Thank you very much.
