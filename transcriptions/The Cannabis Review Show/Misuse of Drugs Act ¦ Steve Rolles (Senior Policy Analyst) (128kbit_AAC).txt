[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Senior Policy Analyst Steve Rhodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve is a Senior Drug Policy Analyst at
Transform Drug Policy Foundation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also an author of After the War on
Drugs, a blueprint for regulation has
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to a number of publications on
the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm absolutely delighted to be able to
talk to you today, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to be able to bestow a
lot of information on the viewers that
[SPEAKER_00]: they may not necessarily come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you ended up as a
[SPEAKER_00]: Senior Policy Analyst and why the misuse
of drugs was so important a topic for you
[SPEAKER_00]: to write about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually kind of stumbled into
drug policy about 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually working for Oxfam and that
had been my kind of academic background
[SPEAKER_01]: and policy background had been more in
development work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But drug policy always struck me as this
strange area of social policy and policy
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that seemed oddly divorced from a
lot of the norms of policy making and sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of pragmatic public health and social
justice concepts, which seem to be sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: infusing a lot of other policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with drugs, not even all drugs,
just certain drugs, they seem to exist in
[SPEAKER_01]: this odd kind of evidence-free ideological
space and the results of it at that
[SPEAKER_01]: approach have been disastrous and they're
there for everybody to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at something like the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971 in the UK, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously 50 years old, it was its 50th
anniversary last year, so half a century
[SPEAKER_01]: in, on almost any indicator that you would
choose, it's been manifestly been a total
[SPEAKER_01]: disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a policy that was very
specifically supposed to eradicate drug
[SPEAKER_01]: markets and deter drug use, but drug use
has risen pretty much every one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 years overall and illegal drug markets
controlled by unregulated criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs have expanded to meet that
growing demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite increasing amounts of money being
put into increasingly punitive enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it hasn't done what it was supposed to
do, but it's had this whole raft of
[SPEAKER_01]: disastrous consequences in terms of
criminalising hundreds of thousands,
[SPEAKER_01]: even millions of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the calculations we did was that,
we looked at all the evidence,
[SPEAKER_01]: more than three million criminal records
have been issued under this act since it
[SPEAKER_01]: was enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a non-trivial piece of
legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say they talk about the war we
never fought and when are we going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start really fighting the war on drugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, three million criminal records
speaks to that, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost a million years of prison time has
been given out under this act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's profoundly punitive and profoundly
harmful, but does not seem to have been
[SPEAKER_01]: delivering any useful benefits at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also hugely expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend upwards of seven billion in the
UK a year enforcing the Misuse of Drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: Act and dealing with its fallout and
consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it felt like a good moment to have a
moment of reflection on the 50th
[SPEAKER_01]: anniversary to look back at the failings
of the Misuse of Drugs Act and the war on
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs more broadly and think about how we
might move forward in a more pragmatic and
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence-based reasonable way based on
public health principles and social
[SPEAKER_01]: justice principles and human rights
principles, kind of things we can all get
[SPEAKER_01]: behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that don't seem to have been
associated with drug policy historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of the work that Transform
has been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, my journey with
Transform has started very much kind of at
[SPEAKER_01]: the activist sort of almost like street
protest type stuff 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the reform movement has moved from
the margins into the mainstream,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've become a lot more focused on
detailed policy work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for cannabis, we've produced this book
called How to Regulate Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: a Practical Guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to sell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go and read it online,
the PDF for free on the Transform website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been translated into multiple
languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's informed policymaking in Uruguay and
Canada and Mexico and a number of European
[SPEAKER_01]: countries, Luxembourg and Malta,
where we've also been working with
[SPEAKER_01]: governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're no longer just doing advocacy and
berating governments about how awful their
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis policy is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they do make the decision to move,
we are actually working with governments
[SPEAKER_01]: now as consultants, helping to design the
detail of the policy, which has been very
[SPEAKER_01]: much a focus of Transform's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Misuse of Drugs Act is almost
totemic of the failings of drug policy and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis policy, given just the appalling
outcomes, despite 50 years of just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing and not getting anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where we're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first topic I wanted to talk
about was the Misuse of Drugs Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all in Ireland, it's the 1977 Act,
but in the UK, it's the 1971 Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we now know that the Irish copied
the exact pretty much template that the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: had developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a very starting point, you've already
mentioned that it's more ideological and
[SPEAKER_00]: research free that this was created
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an element that's a little bit
like Amerigwood, Ainslayer, where there
[SPEAKER_00]: was businessmen that had specific
interests in industries, or is this
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just they were too stupid for
their own good at the time and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: foresee what may be going around the
corner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was a little bit of influence from the
capitalism side of things, or was it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just the misinformed politicians
who drew up this legislation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was shaped by industry,
particularly at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there may have had some influence
It was more shaped by what was going on
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, American policy thinking was
key, significantly that the UN drug
[SPEAKER_01]: control treaties that were sort of the
main one being the 1961 Single Convention
[SPEAKER_01]: on Drugs significantly informed the design
of our Misuse of Drugs Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Misuse of Drugs Act was essentially a
domestic response to the UN Convention on
[SPEAKER_01]: Drugs and they were very much shaped by
American narratives and driven by US
[SPEAKER_01]: political pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those disconcerting and
uncomfortable things that happen in the US
[SPEAKER_01]: around the kind of thinking on punitive
drug policy, issues around race and issues
[SPEAKER_01]: around kind of corruption and some of
those unpleasant political pressures that
[SPEAKER_01]: shape US drug policy, then fed into UN
drug policy and then fed out into
[SPEAKER_01]: countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the UK's position,
for whatever reason, like you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Misuse of Drugs Act informed what's
happened in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, a lot of drug policy in a
number of countries has been shaped by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Misuse of Drugs Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in New Zealand, their Misuse of
Drugs Act is very similar to our one and
[SPEAKER_01]: the same is true in a number of other
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've seen this kind of iterative
repetition of mistakes of the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're well-intentioned,
but misinformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're corrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is, if you go on for
decades and decades and the outcomes are
[SPEAKER_01]: all appalling, not just failure on their
own terms, but clear evidence of systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: harms stemming from this legislation and
this whole kind of ideological policy
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm, and then you still don't evolve
and change and try and reconsider and
[SPEAKER_01]: reflect on what's got wrong and move
forward on that basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really where the problem is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can critique the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly it deserves a critique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just as bad, and really, as the
politicians who failed to do that for
[SPEAKER_01]: generations now, more than half a century,
it's clearly been a failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at rising drug use, looking at
rising drug deaths, looking at the toll of
[SPEAKER_01]: criminalisation and the cost, the amount
of money we've hosted, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still stuck with it 50 years later,
despite that horrible failings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is the most shocking part
of this generally disastrous piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: public policy making, this awful story.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next topic is, if we're going for a
blueprint for regulation, if we have
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians watching this now,
what are the top three steps that a
[SPEAKER_00]: government can use for its steps towards a
regulated market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the first thing they need to
do is to acknowledge that the current
[SPEAKER_01]: policy isn't working and that we need to
have a rethink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that needs to be more than just
tweaking the failings of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really needs to be a more fundamental
rethink, acknowledging that prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: per se is not an effective policy
paradigm, dealing with the reality of drug
[SPEAKER_01]: use, dealing with the reality of cannabis
use and saying, look, this market is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be here whether we like it or not,
whether we approve or morally condone
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use or drug use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to deal with that reality in a
pragmatic way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inevitably, that leads you to say,
look, if it's a choice between criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: markets or responsibly regulated markets
within the ambit of the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to go towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the first thing to do is to
acknowledge that this is a debate that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can move on to some of the
detail about what a regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_01]: would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the overarching principles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who needs to be at the table in terms of
designing the policy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get into the detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you regulate production?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you regulate the products
themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you regulate the vendors and
retailers?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you regulate access to this market?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your channels of accountability?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all questions that Transformer
have gone into enormous amounts of detail
[SPEAKER_01]: with in our book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to be first and foremost
guided by public health and issues of
[SPEAKER_01]: human rights and social justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to keep financial
interests and corporate interests at arm's
[SPEAKER_01]: length.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to repeat mistakes that have
been made with alcohol and tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to be open minded and say,
look, we need to follow the evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: If things work, then we carry on with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't work, we need to have the
flexibility and courage to acknowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: failures and take a step back or to be
able to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, we just need to be thinking about
cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same way we do pragmatically think
about any other area of public health or
[SPEAKER_01]: human rights and social justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that is not what's happened
historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to do what we do with
everything else and bring it back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: realm of intelligent, pragmatic,
principled, evidence-based policymaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: where unfortunately it has very much not
been over the past five decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And arguably even further back than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredibly well informed, mate,
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wealth of information on how the
viewers are going to be loving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing before I let you go,
the new UK government, we had a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: story on Liz Truss blocking Bermuda's
regulation attempts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is she a friend or a foe to the cannabis
industry now that she's in power?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't have any optimism that
this current government will, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: herald a golden age of pragmatic drug
policy reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweller Bravmann, the new Home Secretary,
is perhaps even worse than Priti Patel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a pretty low bar because she
was pretty awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like they are driven by ideology
or other interests, political priorities,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than public health science and
basic principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There seems to be a dramatic reluctance to
engage with the debate on pragmatic drug
[SPEAKER_01]: policy reform, to sort of reject any of
the critique of the Misuse of Drugs Act or
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole prohibitious paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some progress in terms of
treatment and service provision for people
[SPEAKER_01]: with drug problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we can welcome that from the
drug strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the supply side, or in challenging
some of the more fundamental problems of
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, let alone exploring options
for legally regulated markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: we haven't seen any movement on that at
all, despite all the changes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: happening around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're now looking at four or five EU
countries who are moving rapidly towards
[SPEAKER_01]: legally regulated cannabis markets and
transform.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working with a number of those
countries helping to design and shape that
[SPEAKER_01]: policy, but we don't get the call from
this government and they don't seem
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nor, unfortunately, does our main
opposition party, even though the Liberal
[SPEAKER_01]: Democrats and Greens do have more sensible
policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a debate happening and you can
see public opinion shifting and even media
[SPEAKER_01]: and informal opinion is shifting as well,
but the government does not seem to be
[SPEAKER_01]: shifting and it's a very, very low
priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, arguably things like Brexit and
COVID have absorbed an awful lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen, but drug policy, let alone drug
policy reform, seems to be much more
[SPEAKER_01]: caught in a kind of populist or an order
debate than anything representing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pragmatic public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's regrettable, but that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not expecting any change before the
election.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you don't see a medical cannabis
market in the UK growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's going to be Europe that
shows the way and it becomes irrefutable
[SPEAKER_00]: for the government to be turned down with
the revenue that can be generated through
[SPEAKER_00]: tax and jobs created and social equity
programmes where it can be showcased in
[SPEAKER_00]: the likes of Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, certainly medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we already have one of the biggest
medical cannabis industries in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a lot of people in the UK
don't have access to medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's regrettable, but medical cannabis
has nominally been legalised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Access to it is nominally legal,
but not really through the NHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can only get medical cannabis in
the UK on private prescriptions unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you're very, very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical cannabis industry is doing
fine, thank you, in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government doesn't particularly want
to talk about it, but in many ways it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial success story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the medical cannabis industry is very
different from the non-medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and I think it's important to
separate out both those industries and,
[SPEAKER_01]: more importantly, the relevant policy
questions around them, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a medical heroin industry,
we have a medical ketamine, amphetamine
[SPEAKER_01]: and cocaine industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of legal drug industries
that have little or no bearing on issues
[SPEAKER_01]: around recreational supply and prohibition
for recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important when we talk
about these things to be able to separate
[SPEAKER_01]: out those two policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And progress on medical cannabis in no way
reflects progress, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the UK on non-medical adult use or
movement toward legalisation in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have had some progress on medical
cannabis, but unfortunately not at all on
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational adult use cannabis in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time is up already and I could talk to
you all day with a belt of information
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated that
you've joined the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to come on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next 6 to 12 months and get an
update on both our territories and see
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for giving me the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, I hope that was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
