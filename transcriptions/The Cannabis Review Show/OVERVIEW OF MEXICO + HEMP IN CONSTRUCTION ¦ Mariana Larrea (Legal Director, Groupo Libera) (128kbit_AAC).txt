[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Maria Larrea.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the legal director of Liberia out
in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Maria?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so excited to talking with you today
about what is happening in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on and you're
one of our guest speakers at the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Summit coming up in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have you over in Dublin and
Ireland soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, do you want to basically give
everyone a quick little overview of how
[SPEAKER_01]: you enter into Liberia and your position
in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays I am the legal director of
this company, Grupo Libera, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are building the first hemp living
community back in downtown Tulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, downtown in Tulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, the reason I am here is because
I am helping to bring the hemp industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we're going to build with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good project for opening the
doors to the hemp industry in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I had you on is I've been very
interested in what's going on in Mexico at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment and the size of the potential
consumer markets that you guys have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick run through of the policy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal framework looks like in Mexico at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regulation in Mexico started in
2016 because of an unfettered lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trial that we have in Mexico
where you can claim against the government
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for new regulations or claiming
that any regulation is against your
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these start because of an unfettered
lawsuit in the medicinal area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that time to now, we have a few
areas in cannabis fully regulated as the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays we have the law stated in the
law, the medicinal cannabis permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the regulations for these
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is allowed the cultivation of cannabis
for medicinal and scientific purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the other hand, we have the hemp,
industrial hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this industry, we are allowed to
import and commercialize also to export
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products which contain no more
than one percent of THC for industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means cosmetics, food, beverage,
dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those products which contain
cannabinoids are aimed to come into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we have other really important
part in hemp, which are all the materials
[SPEAKER_00]: for construction, for paper, wood,
rope, all those industrial products and
[SPEAKER_00]: for other industry are as well allowed to
come into the Mexican market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, by the side of the recreational
market, we have nowadays we do not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law for that recreational
consumption, but we can go as individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can go with the health authority and
ask a permission for consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a funny thing because you can
go and ask for this permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nowadays we do not have any legal
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mexico is waiting for United
States to fully regulate and then we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though we do not have these
commercial market in Mexico, we have those
[SPEAKER_00]: other two really important markets,
which is the medicinal and the industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp market and are really important for
the economy of our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are we are working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have retail dispensaries that
are selling, let's say, HHC flour and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: flour or is that not on the cards at the
moment in Mexico?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the products we can sell here,
yes, are CBD products or which contain
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoids, sorry for that,
which contain other cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC, CGC, you know, other cannabinoids are
allowed to be imported and commercialized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not in a dispensary because those are
sold as dietary supplements or if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not dietary supplements, also as food,
you know, like CBD drops with hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those go to the classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, the answer for dispensaries is no,
because we can't sell any recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see the leading brands in
Mexico at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they homegrown hemp brands or are they
imported hemp products from North America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for hemp, we are importing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it is not about growing or not
growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about importing these products
because you don't want to fight with the
[SPEAKER_00]: government trying to explain them if
you're hemp or not or which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the problem and the big stigma
in Mexico came from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is the general health law state
that it is forbidden the growing of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, sativa, indica, ruderalis and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that are forbidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that marijuana, it is not a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, marijuana is only a term that we
give to the plant when we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as cannabis, as hemp comes from
cannabis sativa, the name of hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sativa ele.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this big fear from the industry
to start growing hemp with any
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment about the permission of
growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the way in Mexico cannabis
industry is working is through legal
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first thing we achieved that
was a medicinal area, we achieve it
[SPEAKER_00]: because a trial against the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this moment, I think that we do not
need to seek for more regulations because
[SPEAKER_00]: finally hemp is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a plant that does not have
any psychotropic or psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to do is stop asking for
more rules and start educating and start
[SPEAKER_00]: helping governments, legislators and
people who are in important places about
[SPEAKER_00]: this difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not need any any other rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the likes of rice, corn and sugar
are staples of your cultivation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys are world leaders in farming
some of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be that hemp is more
profitable than the tree commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be the case in Mexico or
is the president still backing the
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the agriculture sector nowadays
is really comfortable because their answer
[SPEAKER_00]: to us all the time till it is fully
regulated cannabis, we can start speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the agro laws in Mexico,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them, hemp is the same of cannabis
because we do not have this difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have these classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a general health law, the most
important law of speaking about health in
[SPEAKER_00]: my country states that cannabis sativa is
not allowed to be grown, the agro
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities will say, hey guys,
you need to change this for me to start
[SPEAKER_00]: working in regulation or secondary
regulations for hemp, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, we've been with one of our
clients with the authorities of the office
[SPEAKER_00]: that is registering the seed, you know,
and is the same comment like, hey guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go through the certification of
cannabis seeds in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't have the difference
between cannabis sativa and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa ele, which is hemp, we can help you
because for us it's still forbidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to go to a trial and to
explain the authorities differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this company, two years ago,
start with this trial and they won the
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays they are seeking for a
specific permission for growing hemp for
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD beverage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those guys did it and was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the kind of things we need
to do in Mexico, going through these legal
[SPEAKER_00]: processes in order to achieve regulation
and clearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible stuff, great insights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to jump out now onto the next
topic, which is hemp and construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to get your thoughts on
everything that you guys are doing at
[SPEAKER_01]: Tulum and maybe explain to the audience
that the innovative practices that you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys have got going on over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this I like to tell it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a story about an attorney of
Mexico City, which finished being the
[SPEAKER_00]: director of a hemp construction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason, well, I have three
reasons for taking this decision,
[SPEAKER_00]: quitting the firm in Mexico and moving to
Merida, that is three hours far away from
[SPEAKER_00]: Tulum, are because this project will,
number one, show the government a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: business of hemp in our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important because when you
show it, going through all the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies and everything, it is easier
for them to understand what you are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one, we are educating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time I sell a lot of land,
I am giving all this information about the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only the information will finish with
the stigma in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number three is we are opening the
doors to the hemp industry through this
[SPEAKER_00]: project because we are bringing producers
of hemp for hempcrete, hemp rope,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp wood, hemp rod, but also all the
concept in the development, it is around
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp and the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a holistic development where we
are going to have these lovely amenities
[SPEAKER_00]: as meditation garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have sweat lodge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of those are Temazcales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have also amenities like
restaurant, lounge bar, a jungle,
[SPEAKER_00]: gym, roads for the bicycle and for going
for a walk or a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the development will be surrounded
of the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are taking care that our views all
the time will be green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we want to translate this
concept, Eoin, it is not only building
[SPEAKER_00]: with hemp because that is good for our
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you guys already know that when
you build with hemp and natural fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do not damage the environment and the
hemp storage CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps to create a positive climate
effect when you build with natural fibers
[SPEAKER_00]: and has a lot of benefits for building in
the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hempcrete has like this is a product
that is breathable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to do the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only need hemp and lime and water for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this product is really good and stable
in the jungle because the resistance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hempcrete can be 10 times more than
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a lot of benefits for
construction, a lot of benefits for the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but a lot and a really good
impact in educating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a museum and in this museum
we will help and we will start working
[SPEAKER_00]: with the artisans of the community of
Humay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This community is a community in the
jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to provide them, this
community of artisans, the hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: material for them to start working,
none with cotton, none with wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: none with all those plastics and ceramic
things, but with hemp, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the artisans of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a beautiful project when we are
helping the community, we're helping the
[SPEAKER_00]: jungle because we're taking care of the
rules of construction in the jungle in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to do not go and destroy the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to coexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to disconnect our clients for
their daily life, the party also in Tulum,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those restaurants and all that area
that is so crowded, but having your
[SPEAKER_00]: sanctuary in the jungle and being near to
that ocean, near to the cenotes and stay
[SPEAKER_00]: in the jungle, that is a beautiful
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this is the reason why this
attorney quit the firm, moved to this
[SPEAKER_00]: project and loves to talk about this
cannabis industry, which is my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's amazing talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're nearly at our 15 minutes now with
the cultivation of hemp for fibres in the
[SPEAKER_01]: building industry, I think is one of those
sectors to keep your eye on for sure over
[SPEAKER_01]: the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And great to see the amazing innovation
work that you guys are doing over in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to welcoming you to Dublin
on the 25th of this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your first point of Guinness will be
on me, Mariana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Owen, for all the efforts
you are doing in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we think and in times we
do not see that the things are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the market and the industry is
claiming to, it is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these efforts you are doing and I am
sure this will be a really good and great
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even I start hearing about people
talking about the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will be very, very happy to be there
with you guys and to solve any questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and to try to help you to figure out if in
the future or if right now you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in the Mexican market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be more than happy to help you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Mariana.
[SPEAKER_01]: People rarely envision you building the
road when they're driving along.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody has to build the road to get
everybody there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of people in the
world putting their piece of effort into
[SPEAKER_01]: building that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you very much for your time,
Mariana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a great day and I'll chat to you
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
