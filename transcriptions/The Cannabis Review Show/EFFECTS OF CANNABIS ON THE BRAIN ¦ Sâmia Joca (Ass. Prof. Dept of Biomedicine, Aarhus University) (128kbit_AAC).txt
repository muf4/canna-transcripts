[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Samia Iocca, who's Assistant Professor
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Department of Biomedicine at the
renowned Aarhus University in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samia is originally from Brazil and is
interested in understanding mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with vulnerability to stress
related psychiatric disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Yamia?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fine, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the opportunity of being
here and also talking about our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing lots of exciting work up in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be one of the homes of the
cannabis industry globally with so much R
[SPEAKER_00]: &D and cultivation going on that I'm
delighted to get to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
overview in over 60 seconds of how you
[SPEAKER_00]: came from Brazil to Aarhus University and
to work in a cannabis-based biology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was Associate Professor in Brazil
for nearly 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was investigating cannabinoids in the
brain, effects of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids in the brain at the
University of SÃ£o Paulo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started a collaboration here in
Denmark in the Translational
[SPEAKER_01]: Neuropsychiatry Unit in Aarhus University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as part of that, I applied for a
position in Aarhus Institute of Advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: Study with this first project
investigating the effects of cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_01]: in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I moved to Denmark initially
temporarily, but I could see all the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits and all the infrastructure that
the university offered and it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good place to really develop the project
to apply for one of the positions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily I was offered a position,
so I moved permanently to Denmark two
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago to develop this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be you guys are doing lots
of exciting work up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give everybody a quick
brief on what work you're doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: associates cannabinoids and the brain and
the effects on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have been particularly interested
on the effect of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the components of cannabis
that has been known as known
[SPEAKER_01]: psychostimulant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And already 10 years ago, we showed for
the first time that cannabidiol has
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressant like effect in animal
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been investigating the
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more recently, we saw that cannabidiol
differently from other antidepressants
[SPEAKER_01]: have an acute effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are really interested in trying to
understand how the drug is able,
[SPEAKER_01]: how this compound is able to trigger this
effect, because that can actually lead us
[SPEAKER_01]: to new mechanisms for drugs that would
have the same property in acting faster
[SPEAKER_01]: than the drugs we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what we are working on,
trying to find molecular mechanisms
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in the fast acting effects of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are these basically the effects on the
brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it to do with CB1 and CB2 receptors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there a different method for
absorption for the cannabidiol to the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is a very good question,
because it seems that it depends very much
[SPEAKER_01]: on the model that you are studying,
the stress model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work with animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot really say it's depression,
but stress models that lead to behaviors
[SPEAKER_01]: that we relate somehow to depressive
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the stress model,
cannabidiol would act via CB1 or CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors or serotonin receptors,
in this case, 5H20 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some other models, especially if
it's chronic stress, then there is also
[SPEAKER_01]: the participation of inflammatory
mechanisms or anti-inflammatory properties
[SPEAKER_01]: of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been particularly interested in
the mechanisms that leads to
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, we are investigating the
involvement of neurotrophins and how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol controls that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not clear exactly, I would say,
which receptor, because it seems that
[SPEAKER_01]: depends very much into which neurosurgery
is involved or recruited in that stress
[SPEAKER_01]: model that you are studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a couple of the big
acquisitions that have happened so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, there was an announcement of a
6.7 billion acquisition by Pfizer for a
[SPEAKER_00]: bowel disease based on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already had a cardiovascular company
create a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see that that's really
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabinoids work with
inflammation specific thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the avenue for anxiety and
depression, which is something you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously not a case of an inflamed
brain or membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously another catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it that you're basically able to
target anxiety and depression with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in fact, it could be that's not
where we are particularly aiming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be an inflamed brain in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that, for example, chronically
stressed animals, they have increased
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation markers in the brain,
activation of a microbe, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabidiol could actually attenuate
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some papers showing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, it's mostly because we know
that stress impairs neuroplasticity and
[SPEAKER_01]: then increase the vulnerability of
developing these behaviors that are
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to understand how cannabidiol
is able to reverse that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen in some of our previous
studies that cannabidiol rapidly increases
[SPEAKER_01]: BDNF, that's brain derived neurotrophic
factor, that we know it's required for the
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressant effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others have shown that if you block the
signaling by BDNF, then you block the
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressant effect of many drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we have shown it blocks the
effect of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually want to understand how CBD
can regulate the signaling by BDNF or its
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor to lead to rapid neuroplastic
changes in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the main construct that we are
investigating in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabidiol that you guys use for
your trial, is it synthetic based?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it biosynthesized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it plant grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the metrics that you guys use for
your trial?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tried different ones, but here in
Denmark, well in Brazil, we were using
[SPEAKER_01]: initially extracted from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also tried a synthetic one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are purchasing, it's
extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's natural, as we did not synthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically experienced differences just
if it is sometimes in the time of action
[SPEAKER_01]: when you inject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we don't see major differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as it's pure, it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a scenario where we seem to be
a lot of talk at the moment about
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis and that kind of being the
future side of the ingredient of,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, applied pharmaceutical
ingredients just for the clarity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purification, the amount of harvest
you could produce per year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see biosynthesis surpassing
synthetic and extracted grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think extracted CBD is always
going to be the primary source?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's a very interesting
avenue because there is a return now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's only me who hear,
but in the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a very interesting avenue
because of the other things that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and many other therapies and so
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when we have only CBD,
we don't have and there has been this
[SPEAKER_01]: claim of the entourage effect and also
other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that remains to be systematically
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also something we are interested,
but it's just in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be that in some time from now,
we actually see that it's not pure CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be the most beneficial
approach, but actually an extract that
[SPEAKER_01]: would have, let's say, CBD and cannabis or
some proportion of other components of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do believe this is a good way forward
in terms of investigating the effects in
[SPEAKER_01]: our case in animal models and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be a case that the
blends and formulations of the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and
maybe one or two other molecules is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be new to cannabis based medicine and
where all the IP heavy action is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the combination of cannabinoids
and cannabinoids in general, also with
[SPEAKER_01]: other drugs in new formulations that can
demonstrate to be beneficial for treating
[SPEAKER_01]: specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have played a little bit with that
regarding antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with cannabinoids in general,
as a pharmacologist, I would say first we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what each one of them are doing
and then we play with the combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just the mindset of a
pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you seem to be some of the smartest
people in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be trusting the pharmacologist
over a lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see basically a scenario where we
have basically clip on drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, the thing that makes most
sense for, let's say, a manufacturer or
[SPEAKER_00]: producer of a new drug is to create a drug
that clips onto something that's already
[SPEAKER_00]: there, that you're basically giving,
let's say it's opiates, that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: giving somebody a highly addictive course
of opiates, that it's a blend of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids based pain formula and
opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sweet spot is going to be who can
create the clip on product that already
[SPEAKER_00]: works with something that's already in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's also an interesting
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, for example, tried the
combination in the animal cannabidiol with
[SPEAKER_01]: ketamine, for example, because we know
it's used as antidepressant and it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: dissociative side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to know whether cannabidiol
with ketamine would, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: favor the antidepressant effect while
blocking the dissociative side effects in
[SPEAKER_01]: our animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like from the data we
obtained that it could be an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's animals we have seen in
patients and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think the next step, for example,
in situations like that where as we made
[SPEAKER_01]: for opioids, that you could design drugs
based on the structure of both of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually go through modulating similar
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that have been exploited
or explored actually, sorry, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is actually the chemical
modifications that would lead to synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid-like drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this I know, for example, for
cannabidiol has been done that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: some new molecules that are similar to
cannabidiol with some small modifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been investigated as an
improvement of the drug based on,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, increased bioavailability and
so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think this is also an interesting
strategy to be taken forward by the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a rough time estimate from two to four
to six years, do you think that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be new cannabinoids that end up
being found and processed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say biosynthesized is obviously
going to be one of the main ways to get
[SPEAKER_00]: small amounts of plant matter and turn it
into large scale patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see more cannabinoids being found
in the next two to four, six year period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's a little bit more
longer than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a lot of development in the
field, I would say, in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would expect that we will have new
discoveries in this field with natural
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids from other sources because we
know there are similar ones in other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't be surprised that we would
find similar or cannabinoids, similar
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs from other sources that could be of
potential interest in therapeutics and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be we've nearly hit the time
here now, but it seems to be Denmark are
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the centre points and the leading
tip of the spear when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: European cannabis industry from all the
cultivation and the ornamental flower
[SPEAKER_00]: industry you guys have and the R&D work
that you're conducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see Denmark play a big part in this
global industry over the next 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think Denmark has been very active
in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have experienced in the last four years
since I've been here an enormous growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came in the first time,
it was still less talked and now I see and
[SPEAKER_01]: I have visited some companies here and how
much Denmark has grown, also promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings and forums for discussions and
the industry that are exporting really a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot and that fostered a few in general
also for new discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that Denmark will not only
for the production but also for the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific development of new knowledge in
this field will take a very important
[SPEAKER_01]: position in the years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're nearly at our 15 minutes here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one thing that you're looking
forward to over the next 12 to 24 months
[SPEAKER_00]: in your sector of the industry,
what would you be looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a difficult question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be nice to see more
clinical trials on some of the knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been put forward from the basic
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there has been really a lot
recently but still, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding depression, we don't have a
random clinical trial showing if CBD is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually antidepressant or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that would be there and would
confirm some of the things we have seen in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pre-clinical model, I would be
extremely happy to see that what we have
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing is really translational and
promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very highlighting and
interesting talking to you, Samia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to chat again before the end
of the year and we can get an update on
[SPEAKER_00]: all the great work that you guys are doing
over in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, thank you very much for your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for listening to us and
giving room for us to talk about our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be continuing to do that over the
next coming year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
