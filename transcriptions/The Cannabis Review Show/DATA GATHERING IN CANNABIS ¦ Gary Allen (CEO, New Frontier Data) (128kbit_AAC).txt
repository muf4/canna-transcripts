[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Gary Allen, who is the CEO of New Frontier
[SPEAKER_01]: Data, based in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping, Gary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful Friday afternoon,
so I'm really excited about doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the tale of two weathers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Ireland and it's dark and it's cold
and it's rainy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily we get to converse over chats
now today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are one of the most preeminent
companies in the terms of data gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of your history of
[SPEAKER_01]: business and how you ended up with New
Frontier Data and how you've been there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my career has been, well, started in
the middle 90s in data and technology with
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In digital marketing, bid management for
search of a couple of companies that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was Chief Technology Officer at
Performix, which became DoubleClick,
[SPEAKER_00]: which became Google in the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout my career, I've been really
focused on solving issues with consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: data and with enhancing behaviors through
the applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to organize data in such a way
that mass marketers, enterprises can use
[SPEAKER_00]: it and make relevant decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the second part of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with New Frontier Data since
2016, November of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Frontier Data was started by Jadav
Bar-Decarcer in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the idea behind it was,
you know, there was an emerging market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there weren't any real data
collection, market research, or market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, reporting, you know,
as you see in some of the much more mature
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jadav started the company to
collect data, vet it, make it
[SPEAKER_00]: professional, make it usable, and then,
you know, disseminate that data to
[SPEAKER_00]: investors, operators, researchers,
policymakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been over the last 10 years,
you know, almost 10 years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have been, we've operated in as many as
64 countries at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've collected data from over 100
countries worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really focused this last few years on
the American market, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The American market is very large and very
diverse because there are 30 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: individual markets and ecosystems that
have had to be created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those supply chains, those
consumers, those retail operators needed a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of focus and understanding of the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they are generating, collecting,
and what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me like the most important
decisions that any good executive team at
[SPEAKER_01]: any company could be using is to implement
strategies to gather data and how to read,
[SPEAKER_01]: use computer science to maybe execute on
that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the data gathering in
cannabis, what do you see are the best
[SPEAKER_01]: sources?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the point of sale systems or is there a
multitude of tools that you would use to
[SPEAKER_01]: gather data across a multitude of
industries?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question of what is the best source
of data for any particular industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: really determined by the use case of that
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, for dispensaries,
obviously their point of sale data is the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation of all of their data
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about the cannabis
industry is that, again, as I said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, because every single supply chain
has to be created, in a bubble for every
[SPEAKER_00]: single state, there is no shortage of data
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tons of data from grow data,
from distribution, from manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: from testing, medical, both patients as
well as the administration of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: the administering of medical registrations
and the doctors that are operating in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, with the dispensaries,
all of the retail data, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal answer to your question is
depending on the use case and your
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical that you're in within the
industry really will depend on the source
[SPEAKER_00]: of the data that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to some of the devices from
vapes and medical inhaling devices,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you see that as going to be a huge
future source of data?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the ability to consume the
patient's number of pumps a day and how
[SPEAKER_01]: much they're consuming on a weekly basis
is going to be almost like these order
[SPEAKER_01]: rings where you can basically get access
to this information that doesn't currently
[SPEAKER_01]: exist at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, and there actually are a bunch of
data sources in and around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of apparatus data
collection that's happening with vape
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges in collecting data
in that manner is that we don't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: yet the prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really understand yet that you
can prescribe other medications by a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific milligram, by a specific dosage,
by a specific number of times a day that
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost all of that data collection now
is user controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the consumer, the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is giving you that data and each
patient will use it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for that data to be really useful
at an enterprise level, we will have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a far wider standardization of
understanding what the prescriptive use of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana is for the specific
ailment or malady that they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: cure or they're trying to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the use of analytics and
technology to implement the strategies in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, how important is this for a
company in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this day and age, everybody says
data is more valuable than oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said earlier, there is no
shortage of data in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first got into the industry,
when the industry first started,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a big worry that people didn't
really understand how to collect data or
[SPEAKER_00]: how much data would actually be created.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's not our worry anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your question of is it important for
people to use data for their strategies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's user determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my dog is in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights and nutrient delivery and water
delivery is all administered now by AI and
[SPEAKER_00]: machine learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of data that is
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the THC production under
certain conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: In manufacturing, the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of challenges in the
extraction and manufacturing that data
[SPEAKER_00]: will have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really important in
understanding what's happened before and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to predict what will happen
during the next growth cycle and then
[SPEAKER_00]: during the manufacturing process is really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that filters all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through all 70 some
odd verticals, but that filters all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way through to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really understanding not only what
products are being sold and your profit
[SPEAKER_00]: margin and your operations and your
efficiency, but also what products should
[SPEAKER_00]: you be selling to consumers based on the
consumers that live around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so data really is really prevalent
through every decision that we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding what decision you're
trying to make and understanding what
[SPEAKER_00]: question you're trying to answer is really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the data is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: What determines something to become an
emerging trend that would make you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: start to keep your eye on it and start
covering the data on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, it's one of the ones this year,
the last year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the psychedelic market is an
emerging trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sibin is more understood than even THC
to the pharmaceutical companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: even to the federal government and to the
FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a new wave of investment
and of interest in that part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we will go and collect data
wherever the market tells us to go based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the activity within the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not an exact science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an understanding that we're only as
good as the data that our customers need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will go and we will find whatever
data it is that they ask for.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the emerging European
market that looks like it should be in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next however many years is going to kick
off, again, what are the metrics that
[SPEAKER_01]: would determine for it to pique your
interest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, see with Germany, it's stop,
start, stop, start.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the countries might have had a
medical program, but it's very limited
[SPEAKER_01]: like what Ireland, whereas there's a
handful of people on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your short term expectations for
Europe in terms of the ability to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to gather good country by country data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm sure that data will initially
be valuable for North American companies
[SPEAKER_01]: who want to penetrate into these markets
and whether they're an edibles company
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to manufacture or sell here or a
company wants to get into retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that question is kind of
twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, we five years ago,
we were in almost all of those countries
[SPEAKER_00]: and or collecting data from almost all of
those countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe looked to be lighting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with Germany, France, we were in
Romania.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were actually in the Middle East as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, England and Great Britain's
medical programs, which all started to
[SPEAKER_00]: surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've all constricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pandemic, I believe, is probably
one of the biggest reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not in the sense of only in the sense
of that there were so many other things to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let lawmakers in those countries were not
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were worried about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have good partnerships in Great Britain
as well as Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are partners over there,
prohibition partners that we work with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, as they grow and as they
tell us to pay more attention to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue every year, though,
to refresh all of our data from a state
[SPEAKER_00]: from a country level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the first quarter of
every year, we spend a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_00]: money going out to, you know, we we we
survey about one hundred and seventy
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we end up collecting data from
about one hundred and twenty of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do the same this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we look at that data,
we'll look at it every year for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of your your your question
about, you know, American companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are wanting to expand the American market
is in such a place right now that that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are really driving to profitability
and they're driving to efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not driving to market expansion
like we saw five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a land grab because the
investments in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: have tried, you know, primarily dried up
over the last two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a lot of, you know,
our indeed money to go out and look at a
[SPEAKER_00]: new country and try to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, what I'll say is, as you pointed
out, you know, the the biggest economy
[SPEAKER_00]: that looked like they were going to
actually move forward was Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a start and stop and
start and stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're we're at a point now with
Germany that almost every word becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: news cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we and so incrementally, they're not
making enough movement forward for any one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the data companies to kind of launch in
there and kind of put boots on the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: and really start to try to understand that
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been very interesting talking
to you before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you hoping for something in the next
12 months to happen in terms of federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is this another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that's one of the big I'm
surprised it took so long to ask that
[SPEAKER_00]: question, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this part of my answer is New Frontier
Data's answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of my answer is Gary Allen's
answer from New Frontier Data's point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to support the federal
government in any way possible and helping
[SPEAKER_00]: them as we have with data and with real
vetted resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's part of the research
and understanding the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary Allen's answer is our political
system right now is in such disarray and
[SPEAKER_00]: such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conflict, right, with itself, that I don't
believe in 2024 with with the presidential
[SPEAKER_00]: election, the general election coming up
at the end of 2024 with all of the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: battles of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress, the candidate on the GOP side,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of misunderstanding of the
candidate on the Democratic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that this is going to be a
priority for the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, don't forget that the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress somehow passed a law to abolish
daylight savings a couple of years ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't know they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is the possibility that Biden
slipped something in or that something
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think that at the federal
level as far as legalization, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still a few years away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been absolutely fascinating talk to
you, Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who hasn't checked out New
Frontier Data yet or would like to know
[SPEAKER_01]: more, the website is below and it'll be
available wherever you listen or watch
[SPEAKER_01]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary, thank you very much for your time
and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
