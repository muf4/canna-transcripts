[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Paul Connelly, who's the founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenleaf Cannabis and Hell's Kitchen
Cannabis Collective in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Patrick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of your position in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and your area of expertise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I right now am employed by a
cultivator licensee in New York State to
[SPEAKER_01]: run and operate a cannabis grower
showcase, which is a temporary pop-up
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers market style event that occurs in
either indoor or outdoor venues throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: upstate New York and in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state government of New York put out
this program in order to basically address
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem that was created by the lack
of rapid opening of stores because the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries were supposed to be open a
lot more soon and unfortunately that did
[SPEAKER_01]: not occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they created the cannabis grower
showcase model and I was able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: under the license of my employer and the
farm that I work for, Greenleaf Farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: organize one of those grower showcases,
actually the first in Manhattan,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're up and operational.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm general manager running day-to-day
operations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background in the industry is
approaching it from more of a non-profit
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy side, but being interested in how
sort of the equity side of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: unfolds and how the policy that our
regulators write sort of helps accelerate
[SPEAKER_01]: or make an obstruction for those kind of
equity questions and scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I came from Michigan where there was
legalization a few years earlier than New
[SPEAKER_01]: York and it was not a very equitable
distribution of wealth among people who
[SPEAKER_01]: had been growing before legalization and
among people who had really sacrificed or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to get to the point of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really a concentration of profits
in the hands of sort of large businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate consolidated model businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I moved to New York with the intention
to advocate for more equity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and sort of more tradition and
respect of the people who had been sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: paving the way for this process to be so
easy and for us to have all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genetic resources to access now
that it's legal and those genetics are
[SPEAKER_01]: worth very much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I operate the Hell's Kitchen cannabis
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the Hell's Kitchen
cannabis collective, how many members are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a limit of the amount of plants
that they all each cultivate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all of the flower then all gathered and
generated together?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the basic principles of the
collective and how many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the Hell's Kitchen cannabis collective
operates a little bit differently from
[SPEAKER_01]: what I think people, what comes to
people's mind when they hear collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a collective of truly businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a collective of licensed farms for
cannabis in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there have been about 200 or so
cannabis cultivators who are licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: through the state process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can be a single person or those
can be a business entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, we started with nine
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had three processors, all of whom
basically are members in that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: their wares at our location on
consignment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're invited to come operate their own
booth in any time they want, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend Saturdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's kind of their opportunity to
participate in a retail experience that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot closer to a farmer's market than it
would be to a Walmart or any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate grocery store type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that New York is primed for
an explosion in genetics and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: low key cultivators, shall we say,
like almost what happened with beer to a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree in New York, that you had all these
individual distilleries open up with their
[SPEAKER_00]: own unique profiles and formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think New York is well positioned with
the different ethnicities in that country
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up with some of the most unique
genetics that we're probably going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: in the American market over the coming
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I hope, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that is absolutely a good
observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say what happened with craft beer,
though, is that there was decades and
[SPEAKER_01]: decades of corporate consolidation and
building massive multi-brand companies
[SPEAKER_01]: before there was kind of the up-shoot of
craft beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the movement of craft has been kind of
a boom in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to accelerate that with
cannabis so that it's not a situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where we have to wait 20, 30, 40,
50 years for all of the big companies to
[SPEAKER_01]: really be done fighting with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one left standing starts
making room for small craft operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping that that can all grow
alongside each other at the start of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that New York is a special
place with special cannabis history and
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got specific genetics that it's
really focused on and enjoyed and liked
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time, as well as the potential
to breed a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the offering at the
Hell's Kitchen Cannabis Collective,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it edibles or is it just flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a range of products or is it
people just coming with the best bud that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can cultivate themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it is a range of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to be flour, pre-rolls,
gummies, vapes, infused beverages,
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates, including resin and rosin,
and Rick Simpson oil or RSO, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum cannabis extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have kind of the full gambit of
products available on the New York legal
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the beverage side of
things, are these people that are creating
[SPEAKER_00]: and developing their own products while
outsourcing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the emulsion technology from an
established business or what way do you
[SPEAKER_00]: see the beverages going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the water solubility and the
aluminium and cannabinoids being attracted
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that being an issue for a lot
of these growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't delved that deep into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the first kind of beverages on
the market are mainly collaborations
[SPEAKER_01]: between like a laboratory, like a
processing licensee, and between someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else who's got the idea or it's just kind
of done in-house by the processor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty sure that they're kind of
abreast of these situations because the
[SPEAKER_01]: cans look a little bit different sometimes
or, you know, sometimes they seem like
[SPEAKER_01]: just aluminium cans, but I know that they
have to do that like emulsion technology
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the oil small enough to kind of mix
with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that seems to be one of the sweet
spots of the industry that it looks as if,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think New York potentially be well
positioned for this, that if there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant couple of white label suppliers
of beverages and edibles, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the brands and the entrepreneurs who can
create these brands, who can connect with
[SPEAKER_00]: a specific demographic or audience that
will, I think, grow any specific business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't necessarily need to have the
most chemistry expertise or production
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise once you can come up with the
right brand and the right audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where the winners in
cannabis are going to be, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York in the coming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the processors, I've been
speaking to people in the industry right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, the processors are in a, I mean,
it's a comfortable position for them
[SPEAKER_01]: because they control the supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have sort of extra leverage on the
supply side and the retail side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas we have a lot of cultivators
and they're having difficulty getting
[SPEAKER_01]: their product on the shelves, we have a
lot of, or we have very few open retail
[SPEAKER_01]: storefronts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have no problem kind of deciding
what product they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultivators, we have like almost the
fewest of, even the ones who are licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, I mean they licensed about
250 cultivators, they licensed about 40
[SPEAKER_01]: processors, and then they licensed about
250 stores, but there was a lawsuit
[SPEAKER_01]: preventing the stores from opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're only looking at about 28 stores
in the whole state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the processors, they get to control
what kind of price they buy their products
[SPEAKER_01]: at, their raw flour for processing at,
and then they also kind of get to control
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit about what they sell at
because their processed goods are so
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable and there's only 40 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in such high demand that they
actually are in a lot less of a dire state
[SPEAKER_01]: than a lot of the other players in our
industry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully with federal legalization,
we kind of get the scenario where the
[SPEAKER_00]: processors are plentiful because it's now
an opportune thing that you could go into
[SPEAKER_00]: as a large company who's not necessarily
touching it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we look across the board in
every consumer packaged goods,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars and Cadbury's don't grow their own
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's don't have their own farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've managed to create a brand that
they've been able to translate this into a
[SPEAKER_00]: large market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think these processors are
only, it's only going to get better for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for now, where is the best weed in New
York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in one of the boroughs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in Manhattan in a specific territory
in Manhattan?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were recommending somebody to go
get their hands on the best blaze in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, you know, I'd probably tell you
to come right down to see us at Hell's
[SPEAKER_01]: Kitchen Cannabis Collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some exceptional farms that we're
working with who are from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: state of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow between, you know, some of them
are full term outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are mixed like greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are mixed like greenhouse,
but converting to do an indoor operation
[SPEAKER_01]: for the next season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's kind of every type of
preference available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I would say that,
you know, there's there's definitely some
[SPEAKER_01]: absolute fire, as we call it, that you can
be found in Hell's Kitchen Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Collective, especially I would recommend
the Hayes because Hayes is kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: unique when in Rome situation with New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's had sort of lives outside
of New York City, but it's found its home
[SPEAKER_01]: here and become, you know, a favorite of
many for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend trying some Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we get some of the
cultivators that have been working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows over the last couple of decades
now coming to award winning ceremonies and
[SPEAKER_00]: being praised for the skill set that they
currently have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's if I have anything to do
with it, hopefully they will be sooner
[SPEAKER_01]: than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody who's going to New York or
anybody who's from New York Hell's Kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Collective dot com, the website
is below and it'll be available in all
[SPEAKER_00]: good places you're watching and listening
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you hoping to see over the coming
12 to 18 months in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want an expansion of the card
licenses and the court cases to work
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a multitude of new retail
licenses regardless of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: applicant's backstory is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to see some unique cannabis
branding come to the market where you see
[SPEAKER_00]: these homegrown billion dollar companies
coming out of New York?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, any any of the above would be
exciting and more exciting than what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in the last 12 to 18 months with the
kind of all the roadblocks and obstacles
[SPEAKER_01]: and constant doubt and questioning that a
lot of figures have had with with just the
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of clarity about where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I mean, first and foremost,
I'd like the Grower Showcase program to
[SPEAKER_01]: get extended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's one of the most unique and
special creations that New York State has
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with in this cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that they aren't even really
realizing how special it is and how global
[SPEAKER_01]: of an impact it could have if they put it
in the right context and amplified it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more, because it's one of the main
and only direct to consumer retail models
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis among any legal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's frankly, I believe the way
cannabis should be bought and there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: more fulfilling experience than standing
across the table from a cultivator and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually learning from the source about
what you're going to be enjoying later in
[SPEAKER_01]: your flower product or your edible or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's someone who put a lot of thought
and care and craft behind that and is
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to share that with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably the first major I hope
I have for New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grower Showcase program right now is
slated to end just at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really think that the market's not
going to be ready for the program to go
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no really good reason to send
it away anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also would say, I mean, I would say my
other preference, I think that what I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to see happen is the cards who already got
licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see them get open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the law as written helping
the people that was set out to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are distressed farmers,
disabled veterans, people convicted from
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in New York, people from
communities disproportionately impacted by
[SPEAKER_01]: the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last thing is really,
I just want to see the, just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: said, the true kind of pioneers of this
culture and this plant and the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are stewards of the plant throughout the
time when it was illegal and still pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: along, breeding and genetics and holding
these valuable clones and keeping the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights on and paying the massive power
bill and forfeiting friendships and family
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships and just praying that they
don't get incarcerated and taking all
[SPEAKER_01]: those risks on for so many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see them put in a position to
succeed and succeed in the highest degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're definitely on the right track and
in a pole position to have a great
[SPEAKER_00]: viewpoint of how New York is going to
explode over the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I get to meet in person and we
can try some of this haze at the Hell's
[SPEAKER_00]: Kitchen Cannabis Collective that you told
me about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to welcome you in and show
you around any time you're in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for anybody who wants to know more
about Hell's Kitchen Cannabis Collective,
[SPEAKER_00]: the website is below and also about
Greenleaf New York Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is below as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, thank you very much for taking
your time, Patrick, to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
