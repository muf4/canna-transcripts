[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode of the
Cannabis View.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Aurélien Bernard, who is the founder at
[SPEAKER_00]: Newsweed France.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping it, Aurélien?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking to kind of tip around
now around Europe and look at the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: top media platforms that are in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as everybody knows, Newsweed France is
the top platform in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give everybody an overview of what is
happening in your district.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe get everybody up to speed
and where your career started in media and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you ended up setting up Newsweed
France before we move into the first
[SPEAKER_00]: topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Newsweed was created seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, I worked in the media
industry and I just figured out that in
[SPEAKER_01]: France, we didn't have any cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to fulfill this empty space
and just do what I was doing in my
[SPEAKER_01]: previous company, that's building web
platform, building audience, and just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about an empty topic in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when starting seven years ago,
I was pretty sure I was very aware of all
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis related topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I discovered pretty quickly that I
didn't know anything, that everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taught in France about cannabis was
either dubious or false.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I restarted to educate myself on every
cannabis related topic, mostly with
[SPEAKER_01]: anglophone sources, studies, therapeutic
studies, and all the topics that are
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to answer my own question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the first Newsweed article
was the answer to my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a few months, after starting
Newsweed, it was really a beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gained traction, I gained audience,
and I decided to quit my job to just
[SPEAKER_01]: develop Newsweed and build a true cannabis
media that it is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we are, again, the leading
cannabis media in France and pretty the
[SPEAKER_01]: only one to do what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is writing daily about worldwide
legal cannabis news without advocating or
[SPEAKER_01]: without being pro-cannabis or
pro-legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to cover all kinds of stuff
from political subject to therapeutical,
[SPEAKER_01]: to lifestyle, to culture, not cultivation,
because we can't talk about cultivation in
[SPEAKER_01]: France, but culture, and all that array of
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got extremely lucky, for example,
to work with with MAPS, which is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest tech companies cannabis
related in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all my journey was really, I was very
lucky to meet a lot of companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: of worldwide companies that are very,
very known now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have built up a great reputation
and the content that you put out on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis is very impressive,
to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first topic I wanted to kind of jump
into was European cannabis media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I've noticed about the media
was it was a very open space at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had MJ Biz Daily and maybe BusinessCan
came to the fore over here a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: first and Prohibition Park has acquired
them now recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure they're going to grow their
their market share as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything seemed directed initially at
the the kind of business people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: CEOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been very few consumer based
media platforms that I've noticed of yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the likes of Hightall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time seem to have lost their way to a good
degree that they're not as reputable as
[SPEAKER_00]: they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the kind of cannabis media players
in Europe that you kind of would respect?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously Laura Ramos in Portugal,
a kind of reporter is one of the good
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anybody up in Switzerland or
Germany or Denmark or maybe even Italy
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're seeing coming to the fore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I look at, yeah, obviously,
cannabis reporter, cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Netherlands, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: BusinessCan in the UK, Dolce Vita in
Italy, Kanyamo in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty every European country has its own
either magazine or web platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started news with France didn't
have any.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I created my media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are pretty reputable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the oldest magazines, the printed
magazine, still exist today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in France, we didn't have any any
media about cannabis because it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't advocate for cannabis use,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still punished with fine and
potentially jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the media angle was a way to talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without being punished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all the other European
countries have more facility to talk and
[SPEAKER_01]: write about that subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, business is a big part of all
the media today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to have more lifestyle and
culture, which is important because all
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical and the adult use industry is
based on what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, 30, 40 years before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to be aware of that to build a
sustainable industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the B2B media platforms
now, they're all just rehashing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody puts out one story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems to be copy and pasted 10
times over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the culture side of it and
highlight and specific, whether it's music
[SPEAKER_00]: or food or creativity or whatever it is
that it may be, there's a consumer base
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that are consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody's owning a business and
looking at the tax regulations and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the research that might be coming out in
medical side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis Review are going to be
launching now in Ireland as the Irish
[SPEAKER_00]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of lawyers going to be
writing articles and DJs and people all
[SPEAKER_00]: giving in different types of playlists and
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think there's going to be a
number of merger and acquisitions now over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next couple of years in cannabis media
where there's a dominant player in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see there being still
territorial publications that are still
[SPEAKER_00]: just specific to each individual country?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, media is a complicated enterprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see in the United States or in
Canada, a lot of media failed or almost
[SPEAKER_01]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, The Cannabis was a legacy
media has been bought by a local journal
[SPEAKER_01]: and then closed high times as a lot of
difficulties to maintain its business.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, Lyft was pretty known and
almost disappeared as they are still doing
[SPEAKER_01]: some events this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as for Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: some major could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if we are united, 25 countries
like big gathering, we still have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: difference, mainly in regulatory part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have something and a lot of
language, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really difficult to maintain a
whole homogeneity of news talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mostly see that with each country
will have its own media or medias with
[SPEAKER_01]: several one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't avoid some major between
national media to have a European media
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as for the development of the media,
industry should look at it, too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because media is really powerful and
important to not to do communication
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising, but just to be objective and
spread the reality of the cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: good and the bad sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And industry should support the media
because they are spreading the ideas and
[SPEAKER_01]: really important for Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The media is the tip of the spear in this
industry and that's how everybody is being
[SPEAKER_00]: informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more well funded and the better
content that's been put out by media
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, the better it's going to be for
everybody in the industry, because it will
[SPEAKER_00]: create more awareness and bring that level
of professionalism that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to some of the media platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump onto the last topic
before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an overview of French cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've talked to people before from
Paris and it was a while ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you maybe give us a quick overview
of the first cultivation license I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: with overseed were announced and CBD
flower on sale and dispensaries over
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it still illegal to sell CBD flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's one of the big
territories that's going to, or big
[SPEAKER_00]: industries that will happen in Europe is
the sale of CBD flower being allowed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is going to explode in Europe once
they get all the regulations in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the medical side, we have an
experimentation with 2000 patients for
[SPEAKER_01]: five illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: These patients have the right to have THC
oil and THC flowers now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are experimenting for two years,
one year remaining now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the country decided to give license to
grow medical cannabis in France once the
[SPEAKER_01]: experimentation will be finished and
medical cannabis really enforced and
[SPEAKER_01]: authorized in France to have some French
medical cannabis, because you can't rely
[SPEAKER_01]: on importation forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first company had its license of
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are doing research and development
tests for now, but could be ready to have
[SPEAKER_01]: their first commercial grow at the
beginning of the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it takes a lot of time to
have a facility that is running and ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to distribute to the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But France finally managed to come forward
on something medical cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you may know, we are the first
cannabis user or one of the first in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a big smoker and big consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have one of the harshest law in
France, in Europe, because you can still
[SPEAKER_01]: have some fine and some jail for cannabis
simple use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just processing or smoking of the streets,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difficulty of that is that,
for example, for CBD, we had like 2000
[SPEAKER_01]: shops opened in like two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have CBD shops everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Paris, you may have like 200 CBD shops
with flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everywhere, even in the small city,
in country sites, you can shop CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to the tobacco shops, you find some CBD
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really legal by now, but it's not
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the other CBD products are totally
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as for the flower, we don't have any
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit far west for this kind of
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed even over in New York,
they don't fully legalize till I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's October.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was over there like a month ago and
there's like weed trucks on every single
[SPEAKER_00]: avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there just seems to be that loophole,
whereas they know it's going to be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the point of wasting the time
with all the paperwork and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to you all day early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you very much for
taking your time to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody who hasn't checked out
NewsWeed.f4, the website is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best sources of cannabis
media content in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to hopefully chatting
to you again in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great having you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the next episode, everybody,
we'll chat to you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
