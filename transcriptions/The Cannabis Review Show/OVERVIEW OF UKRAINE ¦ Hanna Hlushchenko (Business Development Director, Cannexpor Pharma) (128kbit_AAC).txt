[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Hannah Luschenko, who's the business
[SPEAKER_01]: development director at CanAxPore Pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Hannah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
little overview of your position in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and what CanAxPore's objectives
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Hannah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the medical cannabis industry for
five years already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, five years ago, Ukrainian
investors started the company in Portugal
[SPEAKER_00]: with the intention of cultivating medical
cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, I was the first person who
joined the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I was responsible for planning
of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I mainly focus on the business
development, which includes sales,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes access to the new markets,
existing one, and also the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: activities of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CanAxPore, basically, we are one of
the license holder for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 20 companies, I guess,
that cultivates medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we are one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start off as the first topic
with cultivation in Portugal, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys have a facility there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain to everybody the informed
certification that cultivation companies
[SPEAKER_01]: need in Portugal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the overarching parameters that
a company that cultivates in Portugal is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to need to have in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we are in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Portugal really is considered to be
one of the best place to cultivate medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Europe, because the policy is
very transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instrument is very familiar with the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not easy, but it's very logical
how to get the license here in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, there are already 20
companies in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: New players are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so the idea is that the first
step is to get the pre-license,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of you submit the documents
to get to give information idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the plan of yours?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start building the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you do this, you go through the GCP
and GMP process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do this, you can cultivate and
you can process the products in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys are an indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you against outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the logic of Portugal is that since the
climate is very good, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies on the south that is cultivating
basically in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose a bit different strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cultivate indoor because we kind of
value consistency of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We value purity of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our products do not need radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, we always focus on
kind of making sure that our product is
[SPEAKER_00]: very high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what makes us a bit different
from some other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to the genetics and
picking the strain that you guys are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to cultivate and grow, is your head of
cultivation expertise from outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe or from inside of Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, our main head grower is
from he was working previously in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we hired him from from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had experience outside of Europe,
but also according to GCP standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the product is cultivated in
Portugal, we have a lot of new markets
[SPEAKER_01]: that are popping up in the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give us an overview
of what are your top two or three new
[SPEAKER_01]: markets that you see in the EU over the
coming years and what are some places that
[SPEAKER_01]: may be going over the radar currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently we are sending the product to
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a partnership with Sanity Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really like each other, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we found our synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the new markets,
to be very honest, UK is hot topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally very much believe in the
Polish market to be for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that the Polish market is a very
good stage of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, from 2022 to 2020, from 2021 to
2022, the market tripled.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are already get used to the fact
that it's possible to get in pharmacy
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Poland has very long history with
the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, Poland was the pioneer in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, people are really
kind of get used to the fact that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can be consumed and have a lot of natural
and positive effects on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's Polish for me is one of
the hottest subjects right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, Poland is such a long
manufacturer in history and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: powerhouses of Europe when it comes to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the manufacturing of edibles,
let's say, or pre-rolls as Poland being
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these territories when this does
become a viable product market for
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to be very honest, I'm very
skeptical about the whole possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: distributing edibles in Europe,
because once again, in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is considered to be
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes Poland different is that,
for instance, in Poland, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility to sell vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some pharmacies that produce
vapes in Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually quite unique because I
don't think this possibility exists in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but when it comes to the
recreational market, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: since none of the countries is yet
recreational in Europe, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to predict what would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see any country regulating cannabis
for use purposes within the next three to
[SPEAKER_01]: five years, or do you think it's going to
be a medically dominant sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody had high hopes when it
comes to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, it didn't happen, at least the
way everybody expected it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, Germany is always a
pioneer in the industry in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most likely, Germany would be
the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the level of competition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany for supplying flour at the moment,
is it pretty extensive or are there a few
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that are well established?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you guys have your distribution
agreement with the Sanity Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you produce good product,
if you know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you understand the logic that the
buyers have when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing the product, then you're good,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to if the cultivated flour
in Portugal has been distributed in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, are there specific fulfillment
centers that, let's say, the Sanity Group,
[SPEAKER_01]: as your partner, would have where the
product is shipped into and it's stored
[SPEAKER_01]: before distribution nationwide?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the levels of security and
compliance that are required for these
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution centers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are GMP partners because we,
for instance, do not have GMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to sell the product directly to
Germany, we need first the product to be
[SPEAKER_00]: processed within the GMP facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the partner of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the distribution,
it depends on what the buyer has,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the company in Germany has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have our own distribution
entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, being able to import the
product into Germany is not that
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are players who can help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to move on now to Ukraine's
playing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a lady who's born in Ukraine and as a
Ukrainian-owned company, I've read a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of headlines and seen a lot of articles
over the last couple of weeks where there
[SPEAKER_01]: was no real depth to what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of what is happening currently in Ukraine
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how optimistic are you that this is
potentially going to be a big new market?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually very optimistic, to be very
honest, taking into account that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: Ukrainian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally saw three waves of trying to
legalize cannabis in Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one started even with the
previous government.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a specific group of people who
are pushing the law for four years
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really happy that we finally
succeeded in doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the country understands high
need in cannabis right now because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of patients and we have military who
are in pain constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is considered to be the best
kind of treatment for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, Zelensky announced
that please legalize medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the government did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the law was adopted in the first
hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step would be second hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it might be a case that the
law will change a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that currently the law is
not perfect because it's the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation we see in Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I anticipate that a lot of cultivation
facility would appear once the law is
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the law prohibits import of
medical cannabis in the form of API and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the form of herbal medicine drug as it
being sold in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only import of Finnish pharmaceutical
product is allowed, which is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, last week, the whole week
I spent in Ukraine, I was invited as an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert to explain how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my job was to show example of Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was explaining how it works in Poland,
regulatory wise, to allow actually import
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it's important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once again, the whole idea of the
law is to allow cannabis consumption we
[SPEAKER_00]: see in Ukraine for those who are in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we stick only to Ukrainian product,
the product will appear on the market only
[SPEAKER_00]: until like not until 2028.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, my job was to explain how
it works in Europe, how to draw a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows quick access to medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be very honest, I have high hopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very early to say because the second
hearing of the law would happen somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, there would be a lot of
discussion in the parliamentary committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be very honest, it seems that the
position was heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that there is an intention of
actually bringing cannabis into Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so previously until date, there was no
medical cannabis program in any way,
[SPEAKER_01]: shape or form in Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ukraine has one of the strictest law when
it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently, if you want to cultivate
hemp, you have an ability of cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp only until 0.08% THC in seeds,
meaning that Ukraine even has their own
[SPEAKER_00]: variety when it comes to seeds for hemp
only because those seeds that are allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe are not allowed in Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be very honest, when it comes to
the cannabis, it's very strict regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, this law is a huge
advancement, really huge advancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who was working very hard on
legalizing it for four years did an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing job, really amazing job because
they kind of showed that it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do this once again because
people, patients, military needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be very honest, I personally,
since the war started, I've obtained quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of inquiries from friends of mine
who are in the military to somehow bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there were requests mainly
because people understood that they needed
[SPEAKER_00]: it by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to the German market,
do you see that being the key influencer
[SPEAKER_01]: on the European wide sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think when the German market is
fully fledged and we've got all the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation and maybe within the next 12
to 18 months, we see some sort of returns
[SPEAKER_01]: on the tax amount that's been taken in by
the government?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's going to be a big
influence for the likes of Ukraine and
[SPEAKER_01]: Poland?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have some impact, but you need to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if we compare Ukraine and
Germany, Ukraine is like eight years
[SPEAKER_00]: behind, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I working also towards the
direction of showing how it works in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are kind of a couple of steps ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we use already practice that
exists in Europe and then we apply it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ukraine, but we are still far,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So until the moment there would be
actually market, there's still a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, obviously, Germany is a pioneer
in medical cannabis in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the way Germany thinks the rest
of the country follows, like Czech
[SPEAKER_00]: Republic, like Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, Poland also recognize
the German from a pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I guess Germany makes a lot of
impact on the European cannabis landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks as if Europe is heading in a
direction where we've got a clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: defined medical market and then the
recreational or adult use market is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be under the cannabis social clubs,
not for profit model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like that could be
implemented across Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that happening yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, and the reason for that is the
following, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big difference was Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, yes, is that Europe
chose to regulate cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no kind of in between process,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So either it's pharmaceutical or it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, for instance, in the US,
they kind of chose the specific cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, I guess, Europe
moving with the pass of social clubs,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because there are no other pass
possible, because once again, you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: put recreational into the pharmaceutical
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I guess that would be that
that's something that would happen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the example of Malta,
we see Spain, we see Germany following a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I guess it is a pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: For now, we're just hitting our time
limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody want more information on
CanExport, the website is below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in all the descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah, thank you very much for taking
your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully within the next 12 months,
we can have another chat and get an update
[SPEAKER_01]: on what Ukraine's potential has become.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really hope I would be kind of
trying to update you on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using my LinkedIn for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, like I really have high
hopes and it seems to me that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: high chance that that would actually
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll have our fingers crossed over
here in Ireland that Europe starts
[SPEAKER_01]: progressing at a quicker pace than we've
seen progress in the last year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, Hannah, thank you very much
for taking your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Ian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
