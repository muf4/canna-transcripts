[SPEAKER_02]: I'll actually for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined by two of
Ireland's pioneers in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and two of the loudest voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be joined by Natalie O'Regan
and Martin from Martin's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you getting on, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much for joining me on today's
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get started on a topic that
we can kind of kick into that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: making a lot of the headlines at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people already know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us your overview of what's
happened with the Little Collins reaction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Natalie, you're a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to give us exactly the
breakdown of what you think has happened
[SPEAKER_01]: and why it's happened for the audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not a lawyer yet, but I'm on the
road to becoming one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm studying and trying to qualify at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cause for what's happening with
Little Collins is they are a CBD business
[SPEAKER_00]: in Galway and Kilkenny, and they sell a
range of CBD products from butter to
[SPEAKER_00]: foodstuffs to oils to flour, all CBD and
all permitted under EU law because they
[SPEAKER_00]: contain less than 0.2 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last, I think, May 2019 was
their first raid and they've gotten raided
[SPEAKER_00]: by the guards repeatedly since then,
I think, four or five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue up until recently was that
Ireland has a zero tolerance policy to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in our legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless if it's CBD or not,
whether it's EU permitted or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland's law is silent on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any minute trace of THC and CBD
products by default are illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had all their stocks taken off of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And JP currently has criminal proceedings
against him due to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a recent Cannavape case in
November 2020 from the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ECJ in that case stated that the
member states cannot prohibit the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing of CBD products that is lawfully
produced in other member states in their
[SPEAKER_00]: member states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ireland cannot ban CBD products that
are lawfully produced in another EU member
[SPEAKER_00]: state country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, our Misuse of Drugs Act
hasn't been amended to reflect that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now in a position where EU have
legally permitted CBD products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Ireland, because of our silence on THC
content, CBD products are effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are... And what's the process for
getting that amended?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have to amend the Misuse of
Drugs Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Misuse of Drugs Act,
it just says the cannabis sativa plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal and it's scheduled under their
Misuse of Drugs schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would have to amend that to say
either the cannabis plant is not illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we would all love because it would
bring in legalization, but failing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd have to amend it to allow 0.2% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That opens up a whole can of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no path forward at the moment for
people to amend that, for the audience to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that we've now got the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a solution that we can present to
the audience as to, look, if we do X,
[SPEAKER_01]: Y, and Z, this is how we can amend this to
have the 0.3% THC quantity allowed in
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just campaigning to the
Minister for Justice and the Minister for
[SPEAKER_00]: Health and the Taoiseach and raising your
voice loud enough so they'll have to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we're not getting very good
responses from any of the departments at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you contact the Department of Justice
and Helen McEntee will say it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Health issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You contact Stephen Donnelly in the
Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say it's a justice issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will contact the Taoiseach and he will
say, oh, I'm talking to Helen McEntee,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Minister of Justice about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, Helen McEntee will say she
has no idea that it's not in her remit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to Stephen Donnelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment, you're just getting run
around in circles from department to
[SPEAKER_00]: department with no satisfactory response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they turned around and said,
we're working on it, we'd accept a
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that these things do take
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be changed overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a click of the fingers action
that can be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the moment, there is no willingness
to engage from any governmental
[SPEAKER_00]: departments on this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is the crux of the story
is they're still they're still raiding
[SPEAKER_00]: premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still targeting CBD businesses and
they're still criminally prosecuting
[SPEAKER_00]: people for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, from where I'm
sitting, it only seems to be certain
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that are getting targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not seeing the likes of Holland and
Barrett or Boots or anything like that who
[SPEAKER_00]: also stock CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not seeing the same level of
enforcement to those businesses as you
[SPEAKER_00]: would to the small local CBD shops in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Martin, are you hearing the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be hearing it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deaf ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to one department, you go to
another department and just keep getting
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed from person to person.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you coming across your
interactions with the guards and members
[SPEAKER_01]: of politics so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I've been campaigning for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I aired some protest that we attended back
in 2011 yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was from the 420 protest of 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even back then, we were saying a lot
of the similar things we were saying
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Luke being Flanagan down at that
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Vincent Lavery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an amazing, very well attended
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, here we are today where
we still don't have access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a medical cannabis access program,
but still nobody's gotten access.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few patients who have
ministerial license, but that few isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere near the money who need access to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like they're just,
I don't know what they're biding their
[SPEAKER_02]: time maybe to get things lined up so the
industry can come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it seems there's no interest
there at all for allowing somebody like
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Collins, let's say, for setting up
their business, they're coming down heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But meanwhile, the likes of GW Pharmacy
and pharmaceuticals are being sold for
[SPEAKER_02]: $7.2 billion, and they're making massive
deals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on one hand, we're criminalizing people
trying to set up industry here in our own
[SPEAKER_02]: Irish people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And meanwhile, we're kind of like
applauding these other big massive
[SPEAKER_02]: companies who are looking to sell into
Ireland the same products we're
[SPEAKER_02]: criminalizing these other guys for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't blame people for thinking there's
a conspiracy out there to keep cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal, because when you try to engage
with the politicians and they don't take
[SPEAKER_02]: you seriously, they treat you as not very
well pointed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start making you running around and
chasing your tail effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to think that there's
something bigger at play that they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to play ball at all, because this
isn't an issue that we only brought up
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, that protest I heard yesterday
was from 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the campaign for cannabis
legalization, I believe it started back in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1990 in Cork.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a sad situation here today that
patients, they're seeing people benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: from cannabis and they're not getting
access to that cannabis themselves because
[SPEAKER_02]: of ignorance out there and unwillingness
to engage in conversations around cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's a complete lack of
understanding has put fear in them that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody wants to put their neck on the
chopping board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to a degree, you can understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the politicians
are there to serve the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And enough of the people want a specific
thing, then surely it is the worker around
[SPEAKER_01]: and a responsible solution that if you got
the community together, everybody be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to put their two cents in and be able to
come up with the most regulated and
[SPEAKER_01]: well-worked industry that we could all
come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think everybody agrees that
nobody wants this anywhere near children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants this anywhere near teenagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an adult use product as is
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be treated no differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'd all agree on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I certainly agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a question for you about now,
Natalie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let you go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timeline for legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your dream scenario and your kind
of expectations of reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin's laughing because he already gave
out to me for my comments on this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: My my dream is to have it legalized
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it legalized yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we are Ireland as a country are
falling so far behind the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're being laughed at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we are absolutely being laughed at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globally by experts of just our draconian
laws, our draconian approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is ridiculous like Ireland as an
agricultural economy have the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: island and the perfect scenario to
introduce cannabis legalization and have
[SPEAKER_00]: it homegrown and have an Irish industry of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Irish products are loved all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure cannabis and hemp won't be
any different when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think realistically, I'd love to have
it done tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how long are we stuck with this
government who aren't going to engage with
[SPEAKER_00]: us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I base my answer is on how
long are they going to be in government?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long before we actually have
meaningful change and a meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: government that are actually going to
listen to the people and implement what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want implemented and implement what we
need in this country and a way forward in
[SPEAKER_00]: this country?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Martin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I certainly don't think Natalie's
wrong on what she's saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with her that currently,
as it stands, the way we look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene, I think we are looking at until the
government changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm hoping to do, I do see a way
in which like if I didn't like the answer
[SPEAKER_02]: Natalie gave us, she said, and that that
was at the end of Geno's event.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe that they're not wrong on
what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe we can change that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can speed it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the people can be the catalyst in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my that's why I'm out there
engaging in civil disobedience protests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't want to give legitimacy to
the law by respecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's a law that disrespects me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It discriminates against me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to give it legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think anybody out there should
be giving it legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should be all marching down to
the guard station, presenting ourselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be in kind of solidarity with
little Collins or whether it be just in
[SPEAKER_02]: solidarity with the cannabis community at
large.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't deserve this treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we could bring the system to a
halt by people just showing up at the
[SPEAKER_02]: doors of a guard station together
collectively and just saying, look,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're here and we're breaking this law and
go do your job now if you can at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe if the whole community stood
up and actually engaged in a meaningful
[SPEAKER_02]: way in this massive disobedience kind of
campaign, the guys at the top would have
[SPEAKER_02]: no choice but to address the issues
because the people working on the floor,
[SPEAKER_02]: they won't be able to keep up with the
paperwork that they wouldn't even have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough room there to keep up with the
sheer volume of paperwork that would have
[SPEAKER_02]: to go through the station to deal with
what I would hope would be a very large
[SPEAKER_02]: campaign of civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it stands currently, there's about a
two year backlog in the court system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's you have a right in under human
rights, I believe, to a speedy and
[SPEAKER_02]: expedient trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the backlog gets to three and four
years, I believe, again, another breach of
[SPEAKER_02]: your human rights there where you're not
even getting your trial seen to in an
[SPEAKER_02]: expedient time, because I do believe that
the Misuse and Drugs Act has violated our
[SPEAKER_02]: human rights in more ways than our
constitutional rights in more ways than
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think we have an opportunity
now really just to take the system and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it to a halt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like with the little Collins thing
recently, like for many in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community, like Martin is doing this a lot
longer than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the straw that broke the camel's back
for many people, like enough is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're gone beyond targeting cannabis
users and personal possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now targeting CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's getting a bit ridiculous now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it is the straw that broke the
camel's back for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pity that that was the straw
because they're a business at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day and that they knew the risk that
they were taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been patients up in front,
the judges before I've seen I've reported
[SPEAKER_02]: on cancer patients who have been
criminalized for growing cannabis and that
[SPEAKER_02]: the judge would completely dismiss all of
their claims that they were growing it for
[SPEAKER_02]: medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was never an outpouring of
support from the cannabis community for
[SPEAKER_02]: those people, unlike what little Collins
has got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I commend the community for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love to see that reflected to
each and every person who's brought to
[SPEAKER_02]: court for a cannabis conviction,
because we're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all being targeted by the same
Misuse of Drugs Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's discrimination, I believe,
that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think little Collins got the media
behind it with the use of social media at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every case gets to see the light of
day, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some do slip through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to finish on one last topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's worth highlighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Irish cannabis community seems to be
growing every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems to be new young entrepreneurs,
new educated voices, some current educated
[SPEAKER_01]: voices who've been doing this decades,
who've been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, like yourself, Martin, it's in a
good, positive place at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: And second question, do you think we need
a centralized database now to start
[SPEAKER_01]: gathering all the different businesses and
different publications so we can present
[SPEAKER_01]: this as a credit jobs report and maybe try
and present some financial data to the
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians and prove how much this
industry is worth to the government?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all governments, what they're
going to listen to the most is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to listen to sob
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to listen to all this
poor fellow, that poor girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to listen to any of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're going to listen to is money
and money talks when you're talking to the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you can present them with a
realistic, workable situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they will be a lot faster to
listen than if you just turn up with sob
[SPEAKER_00]: stories, shall we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not sob stories either because
they're valid people and they're important
[SPEAKER_00]: in their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're being ruthless, you can get
immune to the sob stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you were saying, it's about having a
bit more depth behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you do have to, like even in
my, I've done a couple of tweets recently
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've confiscated X amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've confiscated X amount of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said, right, 20% basic,
20% VAT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how much is going back to the
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break it down that simple,
I think they will actually listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at the same time, they're
probably uninterested and frankly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they probably couldn't be bothered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to do the work for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to actually see if
cannabis legalization is a viable option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's on the shoulders of
everybody else to turn around and present
[SPEAKER_00]: this to government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree with you there,
certainly, that the cannabis community is
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in more ways than one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly online, there's been more and
more people stepping out of the shadows
[SPEAKER_02]: and becoming vocal around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there'd been more vocal all along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're even louder in their support.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like Blindbye, he kind of came into
this situation there recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I would love to see maybe
somebody like Blindbye engage in a civil
[SPEAKER_02]: disobedience protest if he believes that
cannabis should be legalized so much,
[SPEAKER_02]: because put your money where your mouth
is, I kind of think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I definitely do think the
cannabis community is getting a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely moves being made by the
activists now to try to form a centralized
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of movement to try to bring all the
different groups in under the one umbrella
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to de-unify our voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can be stronger, more efficient in
being heard by the politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important that we're all
pretty much saying the same things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can't really do that until we start
having conversations together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is efforts there to bring the
cannabis community together, not just
[SPEAKER_02]: south of the border, but north of the
border, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like there's an all Ireland
affair happening at the moment within the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis community, both north and south,
even across the pond in the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the branches are growing
together, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's excellent to see the industry grow as
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that we can maybe do this once
every two months or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the three of us together and have one
of the chats and give an update on the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry to the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as much as we focus a lot on the
business side of things, it's always great
[SPEAKER_01]: to have education and information
available to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to promote the issues like
little Collins and stick up with them when
[SPEAKER_01]: they do happen and not be silent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you both very much for joining
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem, Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll chat to you soon.
Thank you.
