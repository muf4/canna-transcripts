[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody the next episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Ronit Pinto, who's the founder and
[SPEAKER_01]: publisher of Honeysuckle Magazine in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Ronit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for taking your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick overview in a minute of what your
[SPEAKER_01]: position in the industry is and how you
came to get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was born in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I lived in Tel Aviv for a few
years and kind of bounced back between
[SPEAKER_00]: Detroit and some other cities before
landing in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tel Aviv is where I started writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a background in media and film
in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working in union film sets for like
big budget movies like Jim Jarmusch,
[SPEAKER_00]: Only Lovers Left Alive and Scream 4 and
Transformers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came to New York, I decided to
stop crewing because you spend like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 18 hours a day on some union
film set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, I may as well just
put this to my own sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirations and wanted to combine media
and film.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're doing now with
Honeysuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just like serendipitously
coincided with New York cannabis in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: because we landed here in 2017 when,
well, I started the magazine in 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we started our New York cannabis,
New York coverage in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like a few years,
obviously, before legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of got in at the ground up and
really like connected and got to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and the local activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has kind of informed our
narrative until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of got to like come up with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a Venn diagram of art,
music and culture, cannabis kind of is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the few things that sits right in the
center of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seemed to be a timely launch for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was, you know, we'd always been
kind of into like underground subjects or
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make like taboo issues more
mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found that cannabis provided
kind of like a micro, it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you can look through the lens
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's political, it's cultural,
it's it's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of things you can explore
society through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've had some big covers recently of
some of the magazines with Little Wayne
[SPEAKER_01]: and with Erica Badu.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to these big shoots,
are you in the winter mold where you
[SPEAKER_01]: manage every single piece of the shoot or
do you give free freelance to your stylist
[SPEAKER_01]: and photographer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a common like combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I work with my partner,
Sam Long, who does a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not personally shoot Little
Wayne, but he did shoot Erica Badu and
[SPEAKER_00]: Ellen Cumming and, you know, Wiz Khalifa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am more of a big picture person,
so I'm definitely like producing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm in contact with the reps who
who connect us with the cover artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly am a little intimidated during
the shoots with celebrities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little shy, so I more like to kind
of sit back and then I trust the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, I'm like extremely
involved, you know, but just not like
[SPEAKER_00]: super hands on, I guess, like during the
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably a good person to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys seem to be you've won a lot of
awards and there's a lot of recognition
[SPEAKER_01]: from the political side of of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the cannabis industry in
general, is it Mayor Adams or is there a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific politician who you think deserves
a bit of praise when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think a lot of them are new
obviously, because like cannabis is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we've been working with
Dishida Dawson since pre legalization or
[SPEAKER_00]: pre MRTA since like 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's you know, we've done a lot of
campaigns with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the governor Hokel actually has
been pretty supportive also for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've worked with Tremaine Wright from
the OCM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a lot of people who
are pushing the narrative, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have brought equity to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obvious like continual challenges
in any industry, especially in a
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalist society, you know, where you're
going to have like the competition or
[SPEAKER_00]: interests of like bigger corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's like a conflict that we
see here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people are doing their best to
sort of like mitigate that or provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of balance between the different sort
of parts of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first main topic I wanted to talk
about was New York's new wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like most people would know about
the new wave of art in the 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: new wave of music in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we about to see from New York City a
new wave of cannabis in America and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the biggest companies that are going to
exist in this industry are about to be
[SPEAKER_01]: birthed in this city?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think that New York will
definitely define a new kind of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we've seen obviously in
California, it's been around and it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted and just like an ingrained part
of the West Coast culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less feels less stigmatized,
they're less, a little less, I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say less political, but less charged than
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of brands, I don't know what the
trend that I see is that there's like many
[SPEAKER_00]: brands and it's more kind of customized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're sort of like different
hierarchies, kind of more like fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, like, like kind of like,
like we've noticed these, like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like sneaker sort of sneaker brands where
you have this sort of like elite really
[SPEAKER_00]: high grade cannabis that people love
that's sold and manufactured in smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: batches, but it's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at a higher price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely trending.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how scalable that model will
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of companies, like,
I don't know if it's going to be smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets or like big ones that emerge or a
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see like, you know, some of the MSOs
and other states haven't done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of it depends on how the
companies and brands are like touching and
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching their consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of the legacy, you know,
people who have been doing it already have
[SPEAKER_00]: their customer base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that's going to like
scale or stay the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't heard of one brand in
particular that's like blowing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I do know like several ones
that look to be like successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed as well that Cookies opened
their first New York store there from one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the articles you guys did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the eventuality that the big
brand like Cookies that comes into the
[SPEAKER_01]: city is going to be able to have a
dominant hold or is New York going to
[SPEAKER_01]: always be one of these outliers?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many creative and
entrepreneurs in too many categories for
[SPEAKER_01]: this to be dominated by an outside brand
that, as you said, like almost with
[SPEAKER_01]: fashion, that there's always a hip New
York, New York designer that everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: wants what they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think we all love Cookies
and appreciate and acknowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, the legacy that Berner has
created in the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really tough question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I think that Cookies
obviously has a following and we love our
[SPEAKER_00]: event and everything that we've done with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But New York will be tough because I do
think people are sort of like patriotic
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, want like a specific New
York stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, I'm sure I'm sure they'll do
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess time will tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, we're going to have a lot of
like outside state state companies coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, from somebody who's lived in New
York for a number of years and knows the
[SPEAKER_01]: city well enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always seems to be in New York that
everybody wants to know what's the next
[SPEAKER_01]: best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see a scenario?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see Edibles are allowed within the
rules, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has there been any artisan stores and
let's say dining experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that are starting to happen now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of it over in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: with some kind of famous 420 chefs and
what not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you start to see that in New York at
the moment yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are a lot of infused meal
events like the Mooney House.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some and, you know, there's Chef Hawaii
Mike, Chef Layton.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as to the legalities of the
operation, I'm not exactly sure at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know some of them have brands that
are legit in that in that, like in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in terms of legality, but yeah,
there's a lot of dining experiences,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot like you could probably find several
a week if you looked for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine that a combination as well
is going to be the music side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I would imagine there's got to be
catering to tourists.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be a number of experiences
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see the the music scene in New York
and the cannabis scene in New York coming
[SPEAKER_01]: together to create some unique and
spectacular spaces for consumption and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just one of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music events, you mean, like more
immersive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like which ones are some of the
ones that you've noticed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in terms of will that start happening
in the future is more to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's a lot of music artists
that have capital on hand that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to open a nightclub without
selling alcohol will have cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption lounges in there and blend
that with the music lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that we see it now,
you know, maybe more underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we did a great event at the House of
X.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a Black History Month for
last show based on Josephine Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with this amazing woman,
Mia, and our choreographer and performer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was consumption and a live jazz
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had it sort of themed about about
the end of Prohibition, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: styles, P and his manager, Daniel,
do a lot of stuff like quarterly almost
[SPEAKER_00]: with like Jadakiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have it at Irving Plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, brands there and
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these like cannabis kind of
award shows and cannabis music concerts
[SPEAKER_00]: are melding together to highlight brands
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there's like, you know,
like Astro Club who has like intimate
[SPEAKER_00]: nights with you know, rappers and hip hop
artists and DJs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like a lot of kind of
underground places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the card licenses and the
suspension that happened recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had a couple of experts from New
York on a different stages explaining the
[SPEAKER_01]: different timelines of what's happening
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does it stand at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the card license completely suspended
or are they still able to fulfill the
[SPEAKER_01]: applications that were already put in?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to codify it that will
protect the card licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I know, some they have like
tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like some people who had real estate
and have invested, you know, a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount are able to get their licenses and
have opened others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've opened the C program S E E
and they have to reapply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure a card is going to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they want it to continue or if
they're going to have to reapply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they're kind of like divvying up
the people who have already been allotted
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was business people from Europe
that were looking to come over to New York
[SPEAKER_01]: and learn about the industry, what's the
one event that happens in New York every
[SPEAKER_01]: year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've got MJBs in Vegas that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a couple of the other ones,
MedCan and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the big one on the calendar every
year that somebody if they want to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about the New York industry should be
attending?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think coming here on 420 is a
great time because there's so many parties
[SPEAKER_00]: and events and you can see more of the
industry, like how it works and how
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers operate and what the culture is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of events, you know, they've had,
I mean, Trailblazers came here.
[SPEAKER_00]: MJ Unpacked was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where everyone's at right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some companies have stopped coming
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies are still coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that like 420 is a probably
really good place to survey the scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: make connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's something you're looking
forward to over the next 12 months in the
[SPEAKER_01]: New York industry to come to fruition,
what is the thing that you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the, you know, more really kind of
like cool dispensaries like Union Square
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel Agency just did a redesign that's
just stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Gotham's doing some cool
branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm excited about the marketing
and branding surrounding that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: love like sexy campaigns and just like
overall visuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm definitely excited to see more
consumption lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that there's a huge
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to drink alcohol like
they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they want different options,
maybe even other kinds of plant medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated in there with cannabis for like
mocktails or infusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think like exploding this sort of
consumption lounge nightlife scene as an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative to the traditional bar is
going to be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also remember just to your
point about music and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Rolling Loud is a good example of a
big festival that highlights cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of has made it part of their primary
vertical or like one of their main lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a blast and a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a good way to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ronit, it's been amazing talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to check in more about
Honeysuckle magazine, the website is below
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll be in all available descriptions
wherever you listen or watch this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommend checking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for your time,
Ronit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
Oh.
