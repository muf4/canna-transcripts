[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by Dr Rob O
'Brien, who's the CEO and CSO at SUPRA
[SPEAKER_00]: Research and Development in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Rob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful day here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the morning here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little griff, but it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been reading all your latest
publishings based on the testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: research that you guys have been doing at
SUPRA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody just a
quick little overview in 30 seconds or a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute how SUPRA came to be in your work
so far in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say I'm a reformed academic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a university professor for a number
of years and we spun out a company,
[SPEAKER_01]: SUPRA Research and Development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, we ended up getting into the
lab testing base and then started getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the proper licenses to test for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: At which time, there was a lot of
companies that wanted to, that was
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought that by having our license in
their portfolio, they'd have a quicker
[SPEAKER_01]: path to legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were eventually purchased by Valens
Growworks, became the Valens company.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a year or so there, I spun back to
my main SUPRA Research and Development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We not only do cannabis products,
but we also do other natural health
[SPEAKER_01]: products and contract research work as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wealth of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question is, the ISO-IEC 17025
accreditation that you guys has,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the license to specifically test
and work with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, ISO 17025 is an international standard
out of the International Standards
[SPEAKER_01]: Association out of Europe, actually
France, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a standard for any testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a guideline to your quality
manual, how you validate methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that means that you have
periodically people come on site,
[SPEAKER_01]: go through your data with a fine-tooth
comb to make sure that you're collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: things appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't prevent labs from cheating,
but there's a lot more oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for consumers of the lab services,
they can trust that the lab is ISO 17025
[SPEAKER_01]: accredited, that they are capable of
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first topic I wanted to jump onto was
the latest research on THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of conversation,
as I'm sure you know, in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: about there's no need for high THC,
whereas some manufacturers seem to think
[SPEAKER_00]: that high THC is the unique selling point
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the latest research that you guys
have been conducting on testing THC
[SPEAKER_00]: levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got to be careful with this
because my personal opinion is high THC
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It clearly isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Canada, when they brought the
legislation into legalized cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only thing that they allowed on the
label were the THC and CBD values,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the last thing they wanted is to
attract youth to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't want to have appealing
marketing that would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the consumers then had only one thing
to take a look at, and that was the THC
[SPEAKER_01]: content versus the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over time, we've seen a steady
increase in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've even recently tested products that
were legitimately over 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as this has happened, it's gone up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, our legal system has
provincial purchasing governments buying
[SPEAKER_01]: the material from the producers,
and they've set thresholds for THC as
[SPEAKER_01]: quality higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, if you don't have a product
that's 27%, you're not considered a prime
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, our focus is not even talking
about that, is if you put something on a
[SPEAKER_01]: label, we expect that you have within,
let's say, 20% or 10% of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the correct amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me, is the testing for the
THC levels being done just as drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation is finished, or is it after
it's been put through certain machinery
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're losing trichomes along the way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is part of the problem here,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening is that Health Canada is
requiring a certificate of analysis or a
[SPEAKER_01]: COA from each batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need things on contaminants like
pesticides, metals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also need one on the content of
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the issue with that is that there's a
high variance between buds within a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a whole lot across the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as these buds are going through
the process and mechanical handling,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can lose trichomes, which reduces the
THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you use a COA from the harvest that
is pristine material, and maybe you're
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning on the scale a little bit by
selecting just the top buds and maybe be
[SPEAKER_01]: stemming them or something like that,
you'll end up with a very high COA,
[SPEAKER_01]: which gets you a sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you use that on all your package
labels, particularly the small buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one gram packages, which have
typically three or four buds in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: these buds are 30% or so less than the
biggest buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what we expect is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an inappropriate use of a testing
protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with testing, we need to be fit for
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So testing of one test in a lot does not
really reflect on what is in the packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in the packages that the consumer
needs to be concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you've got, obviously, producers
and manufacturers looking to test as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as the government are doing their own
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one wants to test at one stage where
it's at its premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual test that matters is what's
in the package when it goes onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, let's be clear, the
responsibility for testing is into the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality assurance person of the producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones that are responsible for
verifying the lab can do accurate results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're responsible for the numbers
that go on to the final label.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government has been doing some spot
testing, as I understand it, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't been publicly disclosing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only way we're getting this out
there is when a group like myself is doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this type of study and just revealing,
pulling the sheet back, not seeing what's
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you guys at Super basically work on
higher quality and safer products for big
[SPEAKER_00]: brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific territory in Canada
that you think has the highest quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: the safest products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, is it applicable to America for
the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's sort of step back with that answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This inflation of the THG values is
uniquely in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because the higher THC label
products sell more and sell for more
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is simply that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we did our tests, we looked at
the BC cannabis source was only one part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the each province in Canada has its own
purchasing agents in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't speak for unified.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 93 percent of the products we tested
were more than 50, 15 percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty seven percent were more than 20
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we even had 26 percent that were more
than 40 percent below the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing met the label claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a normal sort of study,
you would expect that a plus or minus
[SPEAKER_01]: should be above and below.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you would expect from normal
statistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not seeing that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of them producers and
let's let's not be wrong here.
[SPEAKER_01]: BC, but even before legalization,
has been regarded as some of the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is just this push that the only
way they can get the product sold is to
[SPEAKER_01]: have these higher elevated values that
they're doing what they can to get those
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, the consumers
are making decisions on THC value,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the only information they have
to go from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're picking product A
over product B by the number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be maybe product B is a lot
higher, but they're more honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we really have to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of producers in
Canada who are fundamentally honest,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're really they're using the wrong
thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it gets to Health Canada and
others, they're saying, well, the testing
[SPEAKER_01]: labs, I guess we can't do it, which is
just complete bullshit because there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: AAC, ASTM, NIST in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: national research that have standards,
methods available for people to use any
[SPEAKER_01]: lab that is wants to do it right can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that the lab gets to
buy a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to report that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not their fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some labs are also on their part,
tweaking up the numbers because that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: they get business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that's happening in
Canada is the cultivators can't sell
[SPEAKER_01]: directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that cultivates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sell to producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Producers collect from a lot of
cultivators and they're requiring them to
[SPEAKER_01]: use specific labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do this, this gives the
processors undue influence over the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those labs that get the highest values
are the ones that are getting the most
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is I'm completely committed to
make sure this stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's primarily a North
American problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the testing protocols that everybody
uses, are these the exact same set of
[SPEAKER_00]: rules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, as you said, are people bending and
maneuvering themselves to be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: around certain rules to have certain
levels of THC written down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's be clear with ISO 17025,
which is not a requirement for the labs in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some don't even have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't specify a specific method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is allowing if you have a better
method, then you can do that as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: you do a proper validation and then do
regular proficiency testing programs or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe test against the CRM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to make sure that you can get accurate
values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a method that is six and a half
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We separate 17 cannabinoids and it's a run
to run to eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we use what's published in some of the
pharmacopias, the method is there is 25
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't fit for the practical sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our method does have us hit the
proficiency testing values very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had worked before on commercializing
biomass extraction cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would know a fair bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to Europe and let's say the
medical products that created,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot more pharmaceutical over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think synthetic, biosynthetic or
extracted molecules directly from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which one is the more suitable
ingredient for a pharmaceutical product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, a premise of chemistry is
if the molecule is identical, then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, regardless if your aspirin is
made synthetically or extracted from the
[SPEAKER_01]: little tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difficulty with natural products is
there's also other things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: co-extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at a pure THC product,
it's very difficult not to have trace
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of CBD in it just because that's
the way the world works, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a bad thing for medicinal
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think in the medicinal
legalization markets that you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe that there's the same type of
problem because there's a European
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacopias and they require label claims
to be within 10% of the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't heard any reports that
those products are a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ironically, a lot of the products
worldwide now are exported from Canada and
[SPEAKER_01]: imported from Canada because we have a
legal base here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ironically, when they land in Ireland
and Germany, we can get the labels right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in North America, we have this
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's complete bogus, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suspect that medicinal patients in
Europe who are buying product,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even sourced from Canada,
are getting good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should add, too, there's a big
difference between a product that includes
[SPEAKER_01]: buds because there's a natural variation
between buds and one that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: extracted and put into a gummy or another
form that's more medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you would expect even a tighter
tolerance on that because you homogenize
[SPEAKER_01]: the material prior to making the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still think there's a lot of room
in the blends and formulations of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes and flavonoids
to create new novel ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: shall we call them, for various different
products and elements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some products we're
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, we had cannabis 1.0 and
cannabis 2.0, which is more the finished
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to get to more medicinal
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal feeling is things like
sublinguals are much more reasonable than
[SPEAKER_01]: other things because we also need to dig
into the understanding of the pharmacology
[SPEAKER_01]: of these materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you smoke a material or use a
vaporizer at low temperature, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I recommend, the neutrals of it are
the compounds that get into your
[SPEAKER_01]: bloodstream and get to your brain quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ingest it, you end up having
metabolites that are formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these can have different, much more
bearable effect on individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, if I eat an edible that
has THC, I'm going to tunnel for four
[SPEAKER_01]: hours and I'm not really that happy with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other piece is that if sublingual,
again, is more the neutral into the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need more research on the
pharmacology and how that works,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then develop the appropriate response
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's things like the entourage
effect that people talk a lot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would need a whole extract to
get those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing people affect,
like if you smoke that product,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you heat it in a vaporizer at a very
high temperature, you're not only getting
[SPEAKER_01]: those products converted, you're also
getting a lot of degradation products
[SPEAKER_01]: based on temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, if you even vaporize a
THC product at a high temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC degrades to CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to keep in mind these types of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the vaporizers, as long as the
temperature needs to be below 200 Celsius,
[SPEAKER_01]: we like to even target 180.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you get degradation products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can lead to health impacts and
related things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing talking to you,
Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can get to basically touch base
before the end of this year and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: recap on all the new testing that you guys
have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, thank you very much for
joining us.
