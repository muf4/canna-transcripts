[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode of Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined by Liz Walsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a topic of conversation that I
think people are going to be focusing on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more and more, is the soil and
nutrients part of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to start things off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a pretty stellar career to date
and have worked at a number of global
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and are an expert in a multitude
of fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give everybody a little
overview quickly of how you got from the
[SPEAKER_00]: business world to the cannabis world real
quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was fortunate to go to business
school from 1993 to 1995 and when I got
[SPEAKER_01]: out the internet was really just becoming
a platform for commerce and I thought hey
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to be new and fun and
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to jump into the e-commerce game
and I ended up doing some consulting to
[SPEAKER_01]: AOL and the You've Got Mail days when we
all got you know magazines in the mail
[SPEAKER_01]: with CD-ROMs that we would put into our
computers to get it and then you know hook
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the internet with dial-up and so I
spent about 25 years in that emerging then
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and was at some amazing places
you know like Etsy and Indiegogo and just
[SPEAKER_01]: really fun opportunities building global
businesses and then I you know was like
[SPEAKER_01]: hey I'm kind of ready to look at something
new and being in New York cannabis was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was happening out in
California and Colorado but it really
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't happening here on the East Coast
but people were starting to talk about it
[SPEAKER_01]: it was bubbling up and I thought you know
this is going to be a really fun industry
[SPEAKER_01]: to be in and it's going to be disruptive
the way the internet was disruptive
[SPEAKER_01]: because cannabis touches everything from
you know agriculture to restaurants to
[SPEAKER_01]: product development manufacturing branding
pharma I mean just so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: things and so I thought hey I need to I
need to learn about this and through doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that and networking and meeting some
interesting people and doing a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of angel investing I found my way to good
earth organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's an amazing story yeah so
you're going to be able to provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth of information for the viewers
today on this episode and let's kick off
[SPEAKER_00]: basically with the great news from
yesterday we were talking about just
[SPEAKER_00]: before we went live there with New York on
legal on the rec tell us as much as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know about that to help us get our
information on that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it's super exciting I mean there you
know people have been pushing for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational cannabis here in New York for
many years and it's finally going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen we're super excited it'll probably
take a you know a bit of time for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually come to life but there were a
couple of bills that were proposed and one
[SPEAKER_01]: of them was called the MRTA and that one
was really being proposed by proponents of
[SPEAKER_01]: social equity and ensuring that a lot of
the tax revenue was going to go back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the communities that had really been
disproportionately affected by the war on
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs over the years and the like and then
there was another bill the CRTA one with
[SPEAKER_01]: leading with cannabis and one leading with
marijuana but essentially the same letters
[SPEAKER_01]: there was you know really much more of
centralized control and the like and and
[SPEAKER_01]: over the last couple of years one of the
reasons that cannabis had not become legal
[SPEAKER_01]: despite lots of popular support and even
legislative support was this battle
[SPEAKER_01]: between the two bills and it was great to
see that they finally worked it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the social justice issues are
going to be addressed and there's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be representation on sort of the
committees that make the decisions and set
[SPEAKER_01]: the laws and the regulations so I think
overall no bill is ever perfect but I
[SPEAKER_01]: think people are pretty excited about
what's going to be happening here in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I think one of New York's one of the
cities that Ireland has close to its heart
[SPEAKER_00]: so whatever goes on there we're always
very interested in knowing about the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who travel there so I think next
Christmas or the Christmas after that
[SPEAKER_00]: should be an enjoyable little shopping
trip there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and I think you know there are
estimates something like a four billion
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar market and you know I think the
legacy market as we might call it here
[SPEAKER_01]: other people might call it the illicit
market is probably three or four billion
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars already as it is so this is a huge
huge opportunity and not just in you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the city of New York where you've got your
eight million people and all the tourists
[SPEAKER_01]: that come but upstate New York where a lot
of agriculture has grown you know the US
[SPEAKER_01]: is still in this crazy state-by-state
patchwork of laws and it could even be
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have 50 states legal and still not
federal legalization the way things are
[SPEAKER_01]: going you know I think it's going to
provide a lot of jobs and opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: upstate in the more rural parts of New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State is a huge state with lots
of open space once you get kind of out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the five boroughs of Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah now I had pleasure living in New York
for two years so it's most people think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just those five boroughs and then you
kind of can realize the size at whole
[SPEAKER_00]: territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick on to the start of the show and
the first topic is the story of Good Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people might not have heard of you
guys yet but those in the know will have
[SPEAKER_00]: already known about the surge of business
you guys have had over the last while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you inform everybody about Good Earth
Organics and how you got it and your
[SPEAKER_00]: story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure so Good Earth Organics is a
manufacturer and distributor of premium
[SPEAKER_01]: organic soils and soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil amendments are sort of nutrients and
things you would add to your soil and what
[SPEAKER_01]: most people don't realize is that soil
isn't dirt you know it isn't the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's out in your backyard or in a park.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really made of ingredients like coco
coir and peat and compost and and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic nutrients of the type that we add
to our soil that might come from fish meal
[SPEAKER_01]: or bat guano or seabirds guano or things
like that and about 12 or 13 years ago a
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman named Roy Leon who was a retired
chemist moved to this area in southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon that is part of what is called the
Emerald Triangle and this Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: area is kind of southern Oregon down to
northern California and it's where I call
[SPEAKER_01]: it sort of the Napa Valley of weed because
some of the best outdoor cannabis is grown
[SPEAKER_01]: that the terroir is grown and everything
about the air the soil the humidity the
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall everything in this area is really
conducive to growing tremendous cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and this retired chemist moves to this
area and you know he starts talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: local people and they're really interested
in having a soil that will be optimized
[SPEAKER_01]: for really terrific cannabis growth but
also be very clean not have to use
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides and herbicides and you know all
these different kind of chemical things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are that are not natural and that you
know can leave residue and whatnot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant so over a few years he worked with
these local growers to create what is now
[SPEAKER_01]: good earth organics and our core soil
blends and we've got now sort of three
[SPEAKER_01]: main soil blends that are can be used
whether you're doing indoor or outdoor or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're starting with a seed or you're
starting with a clone and and they're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of optimized for different stages and
styles of growth and then we've added a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of amendments and things to help
those things grow but being from this you
[SPEAKER_01]: know historically amazing growing area
where you know it's been legal in Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: for several years but the people have been
growing cannabis in this area for decades
[SPEAKER_01]: right so there's a there's a lot of
history to learn from and he took his
[SPEAKER_01]: background and married it up with the
growers to create this really wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: totally organic product that's optimized
for cannabis amazing I think you covered
[SPEAKER_00]: the next topic as well the important of
soil and nutrients for everybody as well
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a it's so important for the process
of getting a good plant with is sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: either cannabinoids or terpenes or
flavonoids whatever it is your objective
[SPEAKER_00]: is with the plant to get how do you see
the growth for the market in the US for
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown I don't think it's even really
touched a major part of that yet would you
[SPEAKER_01]: agree yeah no I think home grows really I
mean if cannabis it's in its infancy
[SPEAKER_01]: homegrown grow is still you know in the
womb so to speak like it's really really
[SPEAKER_01]: early but I think you know plants are like
people whatever you put in a person you
[SPEAKER_01]: know really affects how you perform right
you know this excellent you know amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: athletes don't eat a bunch of junk food
they eat high quality food and plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: the same way you know they're gonna take
out of the ground whatever's in the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: so having really rich nutrient rich soil
is super important and the other thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is highly tested you know home
growers are often growing for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons and many cannabis users are
growing or consuming cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal purposes and it's really
important like if you're a cancer survivor
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't have and you're taking
cannabis to say help with the chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that you don't want a
whole bunch of chemicals in there that are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna interfere with whatever it is that
you're the medicines that you're on and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think home growers also they just want a
really pure clean plant and so knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that whatever they're putting their plant
in is gonna be pure and clean is really
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna help them feel confident about their
cannabis and the testing at the state
[SPEAKER_01]: levels is only getting more and more
extreme like they're really able to find
[SPEAKER_01]: particulates and contaminants and small
things in the soil so it's becoming you
[SPEAKER_01]: know mandatory in way for growers to just
ensure that they're not gonna be not be
[SPEAKER_01]: failing those tests it's such a huge
financial hit if you if your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't pass the test if you can't sell it
you know that that that's a major problem
[SPEAKER_01]: so more and more and more growers are
moving to 100% organic just to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure consistency of their crops as well
as the high yield and all the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you mentioned the terpenes and and the
cannabinoids and whatnot but just not
[SPEAKER_01]: failing the test is a big is a big hurdle
as well okay amazing and do you see in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the market growth for you guys do
you see people buying individual pots to
[SPEAKER_00]: just have the soil in them and then they
get to put the seeds and then what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: process exactly could you describe to me
for a consumer who wants to grow let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: four plants at home we saw in New York is
legalized grow at home laws so if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow four plants at home is there gonna
be a range of different size pots is
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna be individual how are you
guys gonna target the exact consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: audience so I think we're gonna see a
couple different things I think there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are going to you know they're
not gonna necessarily want to start from
[SPEAKER_01]: one seed they're gonna go down to a to a
legal grow and they're gonna buy a small
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that's already been started that
they already know okay this is the strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm buying that you know they're
they're gonna have a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: starting point and and those folks are you
know they're we're gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide them both soil and nutrients that
they can use throughout different stages
[SPEAKER_01]: of that plant's growth I think sort of the
all-in-one kit idea is is you know it's it
[SPEAKER_01]: I think once you're kind of past the the
most novice like I've never grown anything
[SPEAKER_01]: in my life I think people will do their
research and they'll want to do a quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product and if they're gonna grow this
cannabis I think people will be willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: invest in good ingredients and you know
you're there in Ireland so I'll make a
[SPEAKER_01]: beer analogy that you know if you're gonna
make your own beer at home you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna buy the cheapest ingredients and
make like you know a watered-down lager
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably gonna say hey I want to
get really great hops and and I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have my malt be a premium malt and I'm
gonna brew something that's gonna be rich
[SPEAKER_01]: and flavorful and unique and all that and
I think we'll see the same kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: approach in in the homegrown cannabis also
I think people who don't live in a city
[SPEAKER_01]: you know homegrown for people who have
access to outdoors I mean these plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of trees you know they're six
feet tall right and so it's a it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: different thing than kind of a window box
with where you grow your you know oregano
[SPEAKER_00]: and basil and whatnot yeah yeah no I
couldn't agree with you more lastly what
[SPEAKER_00]: are your hopes for the industry over the
next 12 to 24 months have you got any
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you'd love to see happen and
get escalated quickly yeah sure I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: short of like hey federal legalization
let's remove the magic wand and get that
[SPEAKER_01]: done I think there's some steps that would
really help the industry lots of people
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about the safe banking act which you
know in a nutshell would allow federally
[SPEAKER_01]: chartered banks you know the big banks
everyone's heard of Citibank Wells Fargo
[SPEAKER_01]: chase these kinds of banks to directly
bank the industry and right now there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very challenging for cannabis
companies that actually touch the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: you know we're a soil company we you know
we can bank at Wells Fargo or wherever you
[SPEAKER_01]: know without too much challenge because
we're making soil but if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary it's much harder for you to get
a bank account and so changing some laws
[SPEAKER_01]: around that that would allow people to say
if you've got a legal business in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state you should be able to to run that
business with with a bank just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a hairdresser a nail salon or you
know a gym or any other small business in
[SPEAKER_00]: that in that community amazing I want to
