[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Mark Rinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the CEO of Hemflax Group in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man, so I'm not going
to take up too much of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemflax Group seem to be doing a huge
business as of late.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two years seem to be great in
terms of turnover for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the secret to the success that
you've had at Hemflax?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the diversity of products,
or has it been the timing that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: have been able to grow at such a rate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's both.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we have 26 years history in
the industry, so we have a lot of know-how
[SPEAKER_01]: and experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good, of course, especially if you
look at the newcomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a lot of experience to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this first mover advantage over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the second hand as well, our diverse
portfolio of products, as we do a total
[SPEAKER_01]: crop valuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we're using the crop from the
seeds up to the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring everything to market,
and that makes you less dependent on
[SPEAKER_01]: specific market developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially what's doing quite well now,
besides CBD, of course, also the animal
[SPEAKER_01]: bedding with the woody corks, stalk we use
for animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: During COVID, a lot of people took an
animal and took a pet at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need bedding for the cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: They refresh the cage a bit more than
normally because they spend quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time at home, and the product is easy to
be sold over the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our diverse portfolio of products really
helped us ramping up the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who knows anything about the
industry in Europe knows that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: reading a couple of the articles and
laughing at some of the titles like hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: barren, and whatnot, but everybody knows
that you're one of the market leaders in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe when it comes to this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me about some of the
innovations that are happening in hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are, let's say, the two biggest
things that you see coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can only imagine you guys are
growing at a certain stage now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just going to be new products
created for the same type of ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you be most likely to shout
from the roof about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a couple of developments going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you look at the
newaceuticals, I see developments in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where everybody first focused in the new
market on getting extracts, mixing the
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts with an oil, and sell it as a
tincture or a capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always call them the first generation
CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now in the second generation,
or maybe already starting the third
[SPEAKER_01]: generation CBD products, where CBD is
becoming more an ingredient in functional
[SPEAKER_01]: food or becoming more an ingredient with
other ingredients like vitamin or
[SPEAKER_01]: other additives like herbs or curcumin and
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really getting a development.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, for the fibers,
we see a massive increase in interest for
[SPEAKER_01]: textile, where hemp can replace cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton is, from an environmental point of
view, a very polluting fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And water use, pesticide use, fertilizer
use, and that's all those kinds hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use artificial fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use a lot of water to grow the
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modifying the hemp fiber into a spinnable
fiber on cotton lines could change the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry massively.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same is valid in non-woven industries
with disposables where hemp can replace
[SPEAKER_01]: microplastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, disposables are very interesting
trends to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland is known as a construction
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of global companies that
play a role in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prices recently went up for
construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see the prices comparing for
using hemp breed compared to the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: overheads for building structures with
regular concrete?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it depends a little bit on how
well-introduced the product already is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country, in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you're asking a traditional
construction company to use these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: materials, they are not familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to calculate extra costs for the
risk, or finding out how it works,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they're just afraid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are now already specialized
companies in Europe working quite a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time with the materials, and they can
build houses for very competitive prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, you also have to ask
yourself the question, does a hemp house
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be as cheap as a traditional
house?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, it's the total cost of
ownership, not the cost of construction,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the total cost of ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you have an improved insulation
value, you earn back the higher cost
[SPEAKER_01]: during the lifetime of the house because
of the insulation, or keeping your house
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler in the summer like hemp is doing
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You save a lot of energy cost on the
climate control of your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, the end-of-life cycle,
and I agree that not so many people are
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about the end-of-life cycle of
the house if you build a house,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to dispose all these materials,
again, the recyclability of hemp is much
[SPEAKER_01]: better, and you will save quite a lot of
money there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the total ownership cost will be much
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one, let's say, on the food novel
act that we were talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically this going to be the next big
gateway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see all the big companies sitting
at the side, waiting for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to get approved novel food
license, and then they will be the main
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient supplier?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you guys in the mix to be one of
those main companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are part of the novel food
consortium of the European International
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp Association, where we technically
passed the validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not published yet, but it's awaiting
the talk studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The talk studies have been started.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are designed and they're about to
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: The talk study takes quite a long time to
complete, and I have to say the FSA took
[SPEAKER_01]: their very pragmatic standpoint and said,
okay, we will accept the novel food
[SPEAKER_01]: application even without a talk study as
long as the talk study is being initiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've realized very well that
the process of a novel food application
[SPEAKER_01]: takes very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, it's also being
realized if you're taking the products
[SPEAKER_01]: from the shelf, you can take away the
supply, but you will never take away the
[SPEAKER_01]: demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the demand goes underground and
then you lose to complete control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the FSA did a very well job there
in regulating the market in order to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to safeguard the consumer safety,
because consumer safety is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be sure that the brands are in
the market are produced in a food safe and
[SPEAKER_01]: correct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the hemp industry the same as the
cannabis industry to you in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are they completely separate in your
eyes?
[SPEAKER_01]: To my opinion, they're separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you mentioned with cannabis,
the medical marijuana and recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana activities and with hemp,
you mean industrial hemp, because in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, both are related in the cannabis
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak about hemp, I speak about
industrial hemp, I speak about hemp below
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two different industries,
medical and recreational are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly indoors, indoor operation,
have other distribution lines and full
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on the cannabinoids, psychoactive or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industrial hemp for me is really the total
crop valuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take the leaves for extracting
cannabinoids for food, the food
[SPEAKER_01]: supplements, but you also take the seeds
for food, oil, protein powder and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber for many applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, hemp is really different than
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and you guys have three different
facilities for the agriculture of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys see yourself expanding into
different territories or do you prefer the
[SPEAKER_00]: territories that you're in at the moment,
they facilitate the different processes
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant goes through?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have got three facilities, two
decodication facilities, one in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands and one in Romania.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the first step takes place,
growing the hemp and processing it into
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber and chives.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growing, we always do 50 kilometers
around the factory in order to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation distances and cost and
emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And marketing the fiber and the end
products, we do around 600, 700 kilometers
[SPEAKER_01]: around the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by doing like that, you get like a
telephone network, you're trying to cover
[SPEAKER_01]: the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with having a plant in the Netherlands,
and one in Romania, currently we have very
[SPEAKER_01]: good coverage of the European market and
the part of the Turkish market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third facility is in the southern part
of Germany, where we produce insulation
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fiber is being transported to that
place and they're being transferred into
[SPEAKER_01]: insulation material, but insulation
material is very light, only 35 kilos per
[SPEAKER_01]: cubic meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the seals are in southern
Germany, and Austria is being part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: building systems they have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more wood-based building,
prefabricated wood-based building,
[SPEAKER_01]: where a natural fiber insulation product
like hemp fits much better than any other
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic or mineral insulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see that as soon the factory
reaches maximum capacity and
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation distances to our clients
are increasing, we always look for
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities to set up a facility there
as well, to serve the market there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us always important, develop the
market first before you start growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: building a factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart business strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing before I let you go,
I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the big trajectory upwards for hemp
industry over the next two, three years?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one thing that you think is the
most exciting thing that's gonna come
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I see happening is that the
hype and I will almost sometimes tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's more craziness around CBD will
come down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that hemp growing for CBD
only will survive or continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the switch will be made to the
total crop valuation more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore you need the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't practice total crop valuation
if you do not have a professional
[SPEAKER_01]: decontication facility in your area,
as I said before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see more and more initiatives coming
up trying also to capture the other
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think hemp was a big crop in the past
until the prohibition came.
[SPEAKER_01]: After prohibition, it was a lot of
pioneering, but I feel we are leaving the
[SPEAKER_01]: pioneering phase and we're really entering
into the maturity growing up phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that in a couple of years,
I think the area of industrial hemp grown
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe and other countries will only
increase more and more, especially as the
[SPEAKER_01]: positive effect hemp can bring on fighting
the climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And COVID caused a lot of trouble for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do realize that, but I think also it
helped us, the people realizing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to change the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say let us pick up this
opportunity we have for changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate in a positive way and getting a
green recovery with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to end the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a low carbon footprint should be
the main principle for every company I
[SPEAKER_00]: think now in this modern day and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let you get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking part in the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we chat again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
