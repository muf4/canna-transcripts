[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted on this episode to be
joining the recently crowned Canada's top
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, Alexandre Gouthier, who's the Vice
President of R&D and the Director of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation at Renowned Origin Nature in
Quebec and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Alexandre?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big thank you for having me on your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited to be on the Cannabis
Review and be able to share, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry of cannabis worldwide,
finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to talk to you, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people are going to get
a great wealth of information from this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little brief run through of maybe 30
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, 60 seconds of how you ended up at
Origin Nature and your history in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have over 17 years of cannabis
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did start in Europe, France,
Holland, Belgium, and then I came back to
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the laws in Canada allowed for
a medical license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quickly helped people go that had a
medical situation, basically acquire their
[SPEAKER_01]: license and grow their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I evolved to Aurora Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was strictly medical at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the first GACP-GMP conversion,
sent some of the first cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, Italy, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I moved on to title health
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had more of a medical focus towards
veterans as well as having a veterinarian
[SPEAKER_01]: on the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were very inclined towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved on to topical and gummies line,
which require a lot less biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: My passion is cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, I joined the Origin
Nature team, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one I really love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really a shot to the heart when I
saw that team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at Origin Nature, it's really a team
of passionate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody loves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody understands cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I think that's the secret
of doing it well, is actually being
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about cannabis at all the
levels in the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wealth of information you seem to
possess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump straight on to the top
first topic I want to talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's basically been around Canada's
top grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of obviously different
factors that one needs to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration when you're judging
something like this, sustainability,
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation, profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard is it to keep all of these
metrics at the upper echelon so your
[SPEAKER_00]: business is thriving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because surely one or two of those being
out of place would negate a company
[SPEAKER_00]: fitting into the spectrum that you guys
have fit into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really the complete puzzle that
was lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, Canada top grower for me is
a team award.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an individual award.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really thanks to the entire team that
we got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what set us apart was our
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we were awarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We simply, so what you need to understand
with cannabis and the entire workflow is
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is one of the plants that reacts
and adapts the most to its environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting consistency and getting a
consistent product is extremely hard
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you're growing outdoor,
when you're growing indoor, anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: a piece of equipment failing or
fluctuation in the temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the humidity, in the irrigation will be
standardized your entire crop and your
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to cultivate rooms that put
out a product that standardized time and
[SPEAKER_01]: time again is what got us that award.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that award came through simply
outworking everyone in the sense that we
[SPEAKER_01]: do our checks every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rely on one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work strongly with the team at Origin
Nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have four core value, which is family,
street, smart, passion and social
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything we do, how we promote,
how we hire revolves around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also implement a system where we get
the information from the bottom and not
[SPEAKER_01]: from the top down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we strongly believe that the experts in
the field are the one actually doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have meetings every week where
everybody has to be open and honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here to make things better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not here to attack anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to call out the problems and
find solutions together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what made us that strong is
that everybody is passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody understands the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been refining that process to
make it as efficient and as consistent as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes with a true understanding
of cannabis also at the consumption level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you only treat cannabis as a new good
like any other good that you would just
[SPEAKER_01]: package and sell and expect people to buy,
it will not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is, I would say, the illegal
culture that is the strongest and the most
[SPEAKER_01]: developed in the world since easily the
1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot take consumers for idiots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot tell them they're supposed to
be consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took the time to listen to the
consumers and basically create a product
[SPEAKER_01]: that they requested and then was able to
deliver it consistently time and time
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we got awarded Canada Top
Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't grow better cannabis than other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow the right cannabis at the right
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because of our workflow,
we're able to sell it at the right price
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no bad cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only badly priced cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting point, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it goes to picking a team,
let's say, to start a cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, what are the two things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say if you're opening up a
restaurant, it's probably going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: chef and the maitre d'.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the maybe two biggest positions
that you think need to be filled in a top
[SPEAKER_00]: tier cultivation facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say there's more than two
because that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cannabis facility is a complete
machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if one of the steps doesn't work,
nothing works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your QA quality insurance person that is
responsible for everything that standard
[SPEAKER_01]: operating procedure is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are dealing with pharmaceutical grade
production levels for a product that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going to be smoking or
ingesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their safety is at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is a new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the wrong QA, because a QA can
be legally responsible for what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: and you need to have QA that's willing to
try to make things work for the company
[SPEAKER_01]: and not simply blatantly protect
themselves at the small little risk factor
[SPEAKER_01]: that could come along because they do not
fully understand cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A wrong QAP can cost you millions of
dollars and block your entire facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the QAP is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the right QAP that's going to
understand cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't need to know cannabis,
but they need to be willing to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and make that step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your master grower, and not in the part
that he's a legendary grower, often good
[SPEAKER_01]: basement grower, do terrible transition to
the legal market because you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that we're not a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a CPG company, consumer packaged
goods company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding the workflow,
understanding the regulation, having
[SPEAKER_01]: someone that's willing to read the rule
book and then play with that rule book and
[SPEAKER_01]: play with the rules to get the best out of
it is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a grower that does incredible
product in his basement, but doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand cost of production,
operational workflow, you're going to end
[SPEAKER_01]: up with techniques that don't make sense,
that require way too much personnel to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day in cannabis,
your cost of production, the biggest cost
[SPEAKER_01]: is the salaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you have people, the higher you
produce, the higher you need to sell your
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: While your product might be good if you're
selling it at 25 bucks per tree and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half, if you're selling it at 45,
it's suddenly not as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that fine balance, but you are
dealing with a lot more equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you find someone that's truly
passionate, willing to learn, understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do proper tests without putting in
jeopardy the entire facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're running new nutrients,
you don't run that in your big commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: room that's supposed to be selling next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have test rooms or so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the master grower, the QAP,
the VP of operation is extremely important
[SPEAKER_01]: because once the growing is done and we
process the product, it's trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: While it still needs to be packaged in a
timely manner with the right environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: condition as to not damage the product
during that step and then dispatch to the
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer so it's sold fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to sell four or six months
old cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to sell maximum five to eight
weeks old cannabis because you want a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of curing to ensure that
there's been the transformation from let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say the chlorophyll to its gaseous form so
it doesn't taste and smell like hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a certain time, but you don't
really want to go over that because after
[SPEAKER_01]: its cannabis degradation and it's just,
it's a nerve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not made to be consumed when it's
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the workflow that comes after the
entire cannabis growing and processing is
[SPEAKER_01]: just as important because if we're not
selling the product, my dry rooms are
[SPEAKER_01]: filled and my trim rooms are filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's filled, I can't harvest,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're not selling, we can't grow and
everything is linked together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three positions as well as the
CEO, the CEO, if he doesn't care about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and he's only treating this as
another business venture and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like any other CPG, that's probably a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not like any other CPG and the
CEO and the leadership team needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that and needs to respect the
very, very strong culture and knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: base that exists in every single country
in the world regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when those four positions align and
truly understand the workflow and the rule
[SPEAKER_01]: book that are given by government on how
to grow cannabis, then that's how you will
[SPEAKER_01]: perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible insights into how a real
operation is to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump on to the next topic I
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are based in Quebec and you hear
a lot of noise over in Europe about craft
[SPEAKER_00]: growers taking market share from the
larger MSOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the case in the Canadian market
and what's the Quebec cultivation overview
[SPEAKER_00]: look like for you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, we are considered craft grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are craft growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only produce about eight to nine tons
per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a smaller size facility for
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it's absolutely happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're seeing is, I mean,
a lot of big companies that had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money early on, but you see the
operational issues that I've been pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much listening since the beginning of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where there's been a big
disconnection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you need to understand the history of
Quebec and Canada to understand why those
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and those craft growers are now
taking the business share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had medical license since 2001 allowing
us to grow X amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electricity is very cheap here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay three cents per kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of land on the south of
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the entire United States looking
for products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So historically speaking, on the West
Coast, I like to say what happened is
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a consumption expertise that was
born because everybody could grow seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow cannabis plants in their backyard
because the climate was very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people really understood more,
you know, how to be sommeliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus on the East Coast, we were always
extremely operational.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were doing it for the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were doing it for mass production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the only supplier for all of East
Canada and all of the East of the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say we, I don't say me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Quebecers that were in the black
market at that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where an expertise of how to
produce very efficiently with minimum cost
[SPEAKER_01]: and very good technique was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you're seeing very strong
LPs license producer come out of Quebec
[SPEAKER_01]: and those smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, when legalization happened,
all eyes were on Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started with a very restrictive
legalization because we needed to ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: safety of consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're alleviating regulation as
we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as those regulations are alleviated,
you need less capital to enter the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you see the smaller
player that have rooted the legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: experience come in and really put out an
amazing product that's a very good price
[SPEAKER_01]: segments that allow the consumers to move
to those products and truly appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the market shares are
moving away from mass production,
[SPEAKER_01]: where quality is not necessarily
understood or controlled and the price
[SPEAKER_01]: point that doesn't necessarily make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when we process cannabis,
we do everything by hand, every single
[SPEAKER_01]: step we harvest by hand, we buck by hand,
trim by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Package by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of those steps is a
quality control step for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ensure that the product that goes out
is going to be up to our standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're dealing with mass production,
it's all automatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big machines, everything gets destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product gets damaged, dried out,
so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the consumers are not
idiots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They understand cannabis, they're
knowledgeable cannabis, and they're simply
[SPEAKER_01]: switching over to the better product at
the right price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go, I'd be remiss to ask
what's your favorite strain or your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite genetics or favorite flavor that
you've ever had in your time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I have so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the time of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big hash smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly enjoy hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some amazing hash from some good
hash masters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as strain goes, I'm more old
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like cannabis that has extremely
strong potency, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The race to the highest THC in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just promoting drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be looking for 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy smoking also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the original amnesia core cut or the
amnesia super silver haze phenol or the
[SPEAKER_01]: exodus cheese that came out of the UK are
strains that I absolutely love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody listening to that podcast
still has the exodus cheese cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I love the old school strains
with the right turf profile that are
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyable to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not chasing to be super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chase that enterprise experience with
the terpene and really appreciating the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment when I'm consuming it rather to see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm smoking 30% for me, that's like
pounding shooters of vodka, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer a fine wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of nature and outdoor
activity over here that I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers here prefer a lighter
THC quantity and something that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: used during a daily basis while out
enjoying activities with their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to you all day, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got a wealth of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to get part two of this in
maybe in the next six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can update us on all the amazing
things Origin Nature are getting up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, thank you very much for
taking your time to do this, Sax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always happy to come back on the show,
whatever you guys need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of our mission to educate and
help the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you guys need, you can always
reach out to Origin Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got a cannabis summit on on
25th of February here in Ireland,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's all the lawyers and the
policymakers and the economists first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a patient focus going
with the top growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd love to be able to bring you back
over to Dublin, Ireland to help showcase
[SPEAKER_00]: your knowledge and talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great day, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will chat to you very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
