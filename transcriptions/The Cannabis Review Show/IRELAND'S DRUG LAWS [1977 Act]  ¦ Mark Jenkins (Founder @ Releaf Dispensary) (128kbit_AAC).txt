[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by this episode
by fellow Irishman Mark Jenkins,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's the founder of Relief Dispensaries
down in Waterford and Tipperary.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know something that you're in the middle
of has huge implications for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it'd be best to get you on and
get the story from the horse's mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to basically jump straight in to
the first topic, which is the overview of
[SPEAKER_00]: your relief case that's going on at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm basically just going to summarize it
up for everybody and then I'm going to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you one or two questions to make sure that
we've got the exact information based on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my understanding and reading is
that you had three cases that were brought
[SPEAKER_00]: against you, separate incidents where you
were caught with CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them has been tested and proved to
have under 0.2 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them are still independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Results pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the judge, when you brought the court,
said we're going to pause these three
[SPEAKER_00]: personal cases because he has a bigger
case that's coming to the high court
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to basically challenge the
1977 Drug Act and the cannabis laws or the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug laws in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what I want to kind of ask
you is your recent cases were against the
[SPEAKER_00]: DPP and not against the DOH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main case that you're bringing that
will be challenging the drug laws and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the 1997 Act, is that against
the DOH or is that still against the DPP
[SPEAKER_00]: as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still against the DPP.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like that, it's the Department of
Health that are kind of holding the cards
[SPEAKER_01]: for everyone, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unsafe for humans is what they're
kind of going on with the Misuse of Drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would think there's more trials
coming up in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be against the DPP,
which would be against the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Health, which I would say would kind of
dictate a lot of it to us for this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, because basically the way if you
look at it sensibly, the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health have to tell the DPP that something
is now safe to be used and the DPP pass it
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the guards then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the stream of
information and knowledge that's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the case that you had
recently, what exactly did the judge say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did she literally just go, right,
time out in these three cases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wait until the bigger case has been
brought to the High Court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was there any nuanced opinion that the
judge might have said, here, guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you doing wasting the court's
time with this kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like she told him to kind of think
logically, lads, with the rest of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've seven other cases to come up
as well, that she was kind of saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, think logically before even being
charged against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with the district court judge,
because the district court judge in
[SPEAKER_01]: Tramiel and in Dungarvan was both the same
judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was seeing me coming up every
second week and one or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he even said, lads, you need some
joint up thinking here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't keep coming into this man's
house and bringing these cases against him
[SPEAKER_01]: into my court when there seems to be
something going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the judge above in Dublin said
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and so she was she kind of more or
less like the state had no evidence what
[SPEAKER_01]: they were going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, you haven't given me any
evidence here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say either way for the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what I've when I understand is
that especially with the DPP, the director
[SPEAKER_00]: of public prosecution, she's based in
Dublin in the court cases that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the individual counties then they
employ and contract legal companies or
[SPEAKER_00]: legal firms to represent the DPP in court
in each individual county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realistically, the guy who was a
prosecutor, you had very little to no clue
[SPEAKER_00]: about this industry whatsoever and was
following basically whatever the blueprint
[SPEAKER_00]: and the template that had been enacted up
in Dublin at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like that, we the attorney general
would have been part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The attorney general wanted to remain
neutral on it, which the judge asked to it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be confirmed, which he did come back
and which he thought was very strange that
[SPEAKER_01]: the attorney general wants to remain
neutral in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if they're not trying to push the
whole thing down, you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: questioning something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump on to the next thing,
and it's the 1977 Drug Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the drug law laws in Ireland,
as we know, are pretty archaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1977 Drug Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of how that impacts the freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: of movement with the European agreement
that we've already got in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how likely are we to be able to have
that drug act altered or taken off
[SPEAKER_00]: completely?
[SPEAKER_01]: The drug act is holding us because the
Irish drug act means zero percent THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything cannabis related in their eyes,
even down to the hemp farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't market the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything, anything cannabis related is
kind of held under the Misuse of Drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: Act, regardless of THC percentage or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what we're arguing on
with the European freedom of movement of
[SPEAKER_01]: trading goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of what's holding us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's again, the Department of Health
is what's holding any of that for the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers or for the shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it's basically what what seems to
need to happen is that we need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: validation and studies completed in this
country, first and foremost, for the DOH
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to say, OK, this isn't exactly
what we were saying that it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know of any of these tests that are
currently going on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they literally just sticking to
this act and there's been no advancement
[SPEAKER_00]: from the government side of things in
terms of research and development?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, there's not like they
are trying with the hemp, but it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: our side, like it's not the states kind of
coming to us asking us for inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: more we're pushing on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think in fairness,
as much as we're all in one, we know so
[SPEAKER_00]: much about this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like 99.9% of politicians have
literally zero clue about even the
[SPEAKER_00]: smallest bit of information when it comes
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even some articles I was reading based on
your cases, the media publication were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that THC is the main constituent in
cannabis which we all know is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: incorrect statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I said, I think it's our job as an
industry to help educate and to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: these matters to the front so people can
understand exactly what it is that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all debating over, that it's not a case of
this isn't a random challenge that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a valid and a business
oriented one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Education is key in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people still have the stigma that
it's a drug and you're going around high
[SPEAKER_01]: off your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we even have with the coffee shop,
people coming in, you ask them,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you want a CBD or a regular coffee?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, Junior, you'll have me asleep
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like that, we educate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tell them the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right, I'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have the CBD the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they start drinking the CBD
coffee because they know it doesn't make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference, but in the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they seek and they get the benefits
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think another part of this stream is
medical professionals being educated as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole other conversation,
I think, that needs to be had that people
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to somebody in a store doesn't
have the same weight as a doctor maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: given some advice saying, yeah,
this is part of your weekly diet that you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be having.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be very restricted in what we could
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we know it could help you
do this or it could help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't say it because of regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're not a law make any claims,
but it's there's a lot of restrictions in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of them kind of need to
be sorted out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even this novel food seems to be very.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pickly, pickly at the minute now again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's the next thing I wanted
to jump on, because I know you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: food background and it's something I'm
sure you've been keeping up to date
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got a number of products in
this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, for everybody, the novel food
application that's currently going on at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment is happening in the UK only.
[SPEAKER_00]: The UK were part of the European Union
when they started this whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took the novel food application
that the EU generally use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just moved it further along since
Brexit because they've had no red tape to
[SPEAKER_00]: get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see the EU novel food
application lying at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think they'd nearly follow suit
now with the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they're going to tick them
all off?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you got it in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come over here and apply and we're just
going to give it straight to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like that, a lot of products I
would have would have the novel food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would hope that it will just
transition over from the UK over to Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: or wherever, America.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, well, Brexit might have altered
that to a tiny degree, but let's fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed that the companies that do go
through the process over in the UK don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to reapply and go through another two
year waiting process for the European
[SPEAKER_00]: Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them would have businesses outside
of Europe now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Brexit would have kind of pushed all
them to kind of move to other European
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who do you see is like across Europe,
where do you see the territories that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are able to access the products the
best or the most superior products as a
[SPEAKER_00]: buyer yourself for your stores?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you looking at going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Holland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Denmark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Malta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that Switzerland, it kind of opened
up a can of worms for us with the with the
[SPEAKER_01]: core cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was one thing that we were
questioned on because Europe and is it
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, isn't it Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: The transactions, what way it came into
your kind of comes into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to stay away from that now and
kind of more so Italy and Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Italy and Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see in terms of the CBD flower
market that you guys have you guys been
[SPEAKER_00]: selling CBD flower like some of the other
dispensaries or have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see that the quality of that
flower getting better year on year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there one dominant cultivator that you
see in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see this over the next five
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: This once we get this approved that this
will come a massive industry and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see different cultivars with
their own genetics and their own flavors
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting better year on year because
more people are coming into the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are seeing that they would have
been good growers before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're kind of really gone into
industrial production of it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of it tweaks in between
Italy and Italy and Spain at the minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would move from different suppliers like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of one supplier kind of might
only stay to the same same strains the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to kind of move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think that's one of the
great things about the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: is the selection and the choice of product
that you can actually get your hands on is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things everybody loves a new
flavor, a new special every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like that, every farmer has a
different like white widow from one guy is
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different from the next guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's down to the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think those those cultivators are
going to become the kind of hot property
[SPEAKER_00]: in the European cannabis industry,
whether it's medical CBD flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis over the next 10 to
15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people with that expertise will be
the the operators of choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope we hope we hope it comes soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see anybody in in Europe that you
guys are looking to emulate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any good dispensaries or do you
look to North America as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say the cookies or some of the other
brands truly even these guys that have
[SPEAKER_00]: opened up chains of dispensaries that like
there is a bit of a template out there
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to follow the North
America?
[SPEAKER_00]: The European template is trying to start
your own template for Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, yeah, like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few things going on between here
and the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been great chatting to you,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to know more,
the website is CBD Relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're going to be able to catch
up again, Mark, in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some good news on the big
core case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, we know a couple of the
other companies that are doing cases as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully by the end of 2022,
the whole industry has got a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: clarity and a bit more direction and
everybody can kick on with their
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurial spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope it's finished by the end of
next month, July, end of July,
[SPEAKER_01]: 27th of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, happy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us information.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's 27th of July for everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they need to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one in for judicial review
was on the 27th of July.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a store in Coote Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so this is the D Hem Shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a case for judicial review
against the Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have brought a civil case,
not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have had no charges brought
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another case on the 14th
of July, which is another company in
[SPEAKER_01]: Dublin for importation of oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're both taking on civil cases
against the Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the name of that import
company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's not easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Finis Aragon?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name is there online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the D Hem Store, that's the
one challenge in the 1977 Act and that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a good bit of clarity based on
the end of that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would think that the Department of
Health hold the cards for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the farmers, for the CBD stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would hope we get somebody a good
clarification from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from my case alone with the two
of them together, I think whoever goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into court next will have a very strong
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll be keeping up today with
everything here on the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be touching back with you very
soon to maybe get your thoughts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: case that happens on the 27th of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, mate, thank you very much for
joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a great week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll speak to you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you again next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
