[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Ken Watkins, who's director of the
[SPEAKER_01]: American Journal of Endocannabinoid
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Ken?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a very exciting platform that
you're after building and the journey that
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great to be able to share with the
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you ended up coming
[SPEAKER_01]: to found AGM and what your position in the
industry is, please?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been in the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been in the medical
advertising industry for about 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 years, always on the pharmaceutical
side of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked for the British Medical
Association, the American College of
[SPEAKER_00]: Physicians, a lot of for-profits,
not-for-profits, med-ed companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, always with the doctor as our
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it was around 2018 I started to
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that I knew were being helped by
medical cannabis, either with sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder problems, chronic pain problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the same time, I stumbled upon a
video of children who were having their
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures arrested by cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was the catalyst that
really got me interested to at least
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate a little bit more and see if
there was anything to medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: its utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already been involved with
traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just seemed like a natural next
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I was convinced that medical cannabis
was in fact medicine, I felt a need almost
[SPEAKER_00]: to legitimize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought the best way to do that was
with a traditional peer-reviewed medical
[SPEAKER_00]: journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and a fantastic job you've done so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have become a real top leading
source of information on the ECS for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical professionals in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the main targeted outset?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, how do you come to the process
of validating what papers get published
[SPEAKER_01]: and what don't?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because an Apple and an Orange are two
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we know, there's thousands of
publications that have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you guys choose the best ones to
publish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have somebody that's been with the
publication from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is Megan Rolla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all content, all studies, all research
flows through her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she puts it through a rigorous
peer-review process with the folks on our
[SPEAKER_00]: editorial board just to make sure that
everything is factually accurate and
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different times we'll have a
conversation with our editor-in-chief,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Leslie Apbar, Megan Rolloff,
and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have pretty detailed
conversations about which studies should
[SPEAKER_00]: be included.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a lot of the anecdotal studies
and case studies we're including now as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You recently had a great deal with
Haymarket Media Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the merger and acquisitions of
cannabis media outlets and information
[SPEAKER_01]: outlets in the industry being a more
valuable asset for people to target in the
[SPEAKER_01]: coming future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you guys are kind of at the top
of the food chain with the most foremost
[SPEAKER_01]: medical information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you see that trickling down across
the sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do hope so, because I think
the science and the research should be
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's north star, at least on the
medical side of the house, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what's going to inform
doctors' decisions and lead us to better
[SPEAKER_00]: patient outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think the doctor is in a difficult
position right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being asked about medical cannabis
and CBD and all these other things by
[SPEAKER_00]: their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the same time, they're at a
disadvantage because they were never
[SPEAKER_00]: trained on the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of one of the things that
we're hoping to help out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least to show doctors like,
yes, you know, inside each one of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like we have a cardiovascular system,
just we have a nervous system,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, let's start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's establish that that foundation
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we can go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the future of the drug
discovery and development side of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual molecule that's going to be the
ingredient for these will have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: registered as an API.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether with EMA or with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see fermentation engineering being
the conduit to create these molecules as
[SPEAKER_01]: pure and as replicable and safe as going
to be required for large scale drug
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery and development?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hearing a lot about, you know,
different ways to synthesize and present
[SPEAKER_00]: these molecules for FDA approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also reading a lot about something I
wasn't too schooled up on, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical drug pathway that the FDA
already has in place is something that,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I don't know a lot about,
but the more I read about it, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like it could be a viable
option as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just for cannabis, for any plant
based medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're publishing these papers,
do you see a heavy lean towards
[SPEAKER_01]: neuropathic pain, inflammation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they kind of the two main ailments
that everybody's going after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have seen some companies that
have developed gastrointestinal
[SPEAKER_01]: information products and cardiovascular
information products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the ability to target these
inflammation receptors, do you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the main capital expenditure is
going to go in the coming years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are companies out there that
are already targeting specific conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease states with one molecule
synthesized compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen, that's one path to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a patient meets with success with
that, why would we have a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a faction of folks out
there that are 100% against the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesized cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, at the end of the day,
if it helps people, if it helps patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the journal is as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it seems to be whatever is the
safest and most regulated and effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: replicable solution is what politicians
who have no vested interest or
[SPEAKER_01]: policymakers who have no vested interest
want to see whether it's in medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or across a multitude of the
pharmaceutical sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you want the safest possible
delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you have to be cognizant about
drug-drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, a lot of people think it's
because it's natural, because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, it's completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, it's very,
very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are things you do have to keep
your eye out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And drug-drug interactions is definitely
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the potential IP and patent
ability for people to create their own
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage effect from blending terpenes
with cannabinoids and flavonoids to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to make these new formulations that
can deliver for patients across ailment,
[SPEAKER_01]: ABC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of, again, one of the main
targets that a lot of these companies
[SPEAKER_01]: should be going after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because surely if the entourage effect is
what everybody goes on about, a biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: company can actually make their own
perfect formulation of these molecules,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems like a very advantageous route to
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one route that I'm hearing that
pharmaceutical companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-pharmaceutical companies, health and
wellness companies, are actually taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're looking at is with all these
different cannabinoids that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, can we extract them, synthesize
them, and then bring them kind of back
[SPEAKER_00]: together along with the terpenes and the
flavonoids and kind of recreate
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetically what got created in the
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the people that push
back on that are saying, why not just use
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the reason why we can or might
not be able to is it doesn't fit nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: into the FDA approval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's where I've been learning
more about the plant-based approval
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have published some recent
research on psychedelic research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be another pretty
advantageous route from mental health and
[SPEAKER_01]: depression and PTSD's potential solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is psilocybin going to be the key molecule
within that industry like we've seen CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: and THC in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like that's going to be the case,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD looked like it was the gateway
molecule into the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the molecule that everybody kind of
learned about at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: got very popular at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can thank CBD because it made
people curious about what the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are in the plant and what
they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should have said this at the
beginning, but we are not specifically a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We study the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is a
therapeutic target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So psychedelic medicine, anything that
engages with the ECS is what we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: report on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like every month that goes
by, we're finding something else that we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know engaged with the
endocannabinoid system that in fact does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the pathway to get to
psilocybin, there's a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediates along the way to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be a much longer process,
a more capital intensive process to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really see that the only way a full
global market for these drugs are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: become available again, if somebody can
produce these in 20,000 liter batches
[SPEAKER_01]: every week, because realistically
cultivating psilocybin for mushrooms for a
[SPEAKER_01]: global population is not much of a
realistic option?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think again, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the direction that this is
going into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are going to make this medicine
available to as many people as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that it would have to be
synthesized in order for it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed to that many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems as well that the kind of big,
big topics at the moment in
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals are the big future
potential gains that can happen in
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in therapies,
cell therapies, microbial antibodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the psilocybin and mental health
side of the issue being a dominant player
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next five to 10 years, because as
much as there's been low hanging fruit for
[SPEAKER_01]: biotech and pharmaceutical companies over
the last couple of decades, it's all about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's new and what's potentially upcoming
that's coming around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the big, large pharmaceutical
drug manufacturers are looking at it like
[SPEAKER_01]: this and are waiting for biotech companies
to do the heavy lifting and then come in
[SPEAKER_01]: and acquire as may be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, typical farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to wait, I think,
for the smaller companies to develop these
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big boys will come in and
just buy up the smaller fish, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a system that has worked for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to your point, it will
probably continue to go down that road.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other exciting topics and areas are
you starting to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you expecting to see over the
coming 12 to 24 months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you reckon the scheduling from one to
three will have a big impact on the
[SPEAKER_01]: research and development side of the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the biggest things that I
hope comes out of the rescheduling,
[SPEAKER_00]: the schedule three is hopefully this
avalanche of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that avalanche happens here
in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have access to the plant to study,
I'm thinking that every university in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country should be studying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing now is there's great
work coming from great research,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from Israel, coming from Canada,
coming from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And America just has to jump in there with
both feet and do what it does best,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a leader in science and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little old Ireland here with all the home
of all the pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll be too far behind
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some very interesting things I'm
sure will happen here over the coming
[SPEAKER_01]: years as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on the industry
over the next 12 to 24 months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the stocks jump in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the scheduling happen is safe
back coming to reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is, you know, I don't want to
say it's the moment everybody has been
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for, because as you are probably
well aware, there's a big push against
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule three, you know, not just here in
America, but throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of those fears are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, good people and quality
companies, I think, are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively impacted by schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, far more people and
far more companies are going to benefit by
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we just took what we were
talking about, you know, the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's going to be released
because of schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you add on things like self safe
banking, you know, and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are going to come along with
schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really good, strong step in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to free up a lot of
a lot of capital, a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what we're going to see
come from it is research and then products
[SPEAKER_00]: from that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited about all of that,
you know, and we hope to be there in an
[SPEAKER_00]: educational arm and also in a marketing
arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be as well if the scheduling
happens that as much as some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are going to end up getting
butchered in the industry, the big winner
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be the patient years down the
road that patients will have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: more refined drugs that deliver a non
addictive and maybe a better solution than
[SPEAKER_01]: current market methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's where I get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, the patient was always
at the center of all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't really get involved
with the rec side of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our gym is 100 percent medical and the
patient is at the center of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I look forward to a day when
patients are going to be able to access
[SPEAKER_00]: medication that has less side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not taking a pill and then
three pills for the for the side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, you know, cannabis is very
effective in certain conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely safe at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that to me is the big payoff
of medical cannabis and plant based
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't agree more, Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just up at the 15 minute mark now
for anybody who's never been to the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoidmedicine.com website.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link is below and it'll be available
wherever you watch or listen to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't recommend a site more for
everybody should be subscribing and
[SPEAKER_01]: checking this website up to date because
it's at the forefront of all the most
[SPEAKER_01]: pertinent information in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken, thank you very much for taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
