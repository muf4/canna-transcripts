[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode of Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Natal Partanski, who's the founder and CEO
[SPEAKER_00]: at Sorting Robotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Natal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very pleasure to speak to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of your company and the
[SPEAKER_00]: position you're in and how you ended up
focusing on the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so a little overview of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a robotics company that specifically
builds robots for cannabis manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super high level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started back in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and one of my co-founders are working
at NASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working on a device that's currently
on the surface of Mars, producing oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Martian atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we wanted to build a company of
our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we built this company coming
straight out of NASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually were in e-commerce doing
inventory management for your e-commerce
[SPEAKER_01]: sellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 2019 team frame, we wanted to
pivot the company into a much bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: market where we found cannabis as like a
really strong opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we loved the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We loved robots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then in 2020, we sold off the first
part of the company and then kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: solely focused on making robots for
cannabis manufacturers and launched our
[SPEAKER_01]: first product in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all she wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've kind of built a bunch of
things from then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been very interesting research
in your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've interviewed over 300 different CEOs
and founders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing everybody's kind of
agreed with that automation is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a massive opportunity within the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technology you guys are implementing,
can you maybe give everybody a little run
[SPEAKER_00]: through or what are the current offerings
you guys have in terms of robotics and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they fit with each individual category and
segment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say our main focus these days is
working on pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we sell kind of every step in
the pre-roll manufacturing chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sell a machine that manufactures
pre-rolls, kind of packs them,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're pre-rolls or blunts or
straight tubes or half grams or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have another system that we
invented back in 2021 called the Gico
[SPEAKER_01]: robot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Gico robot will inject concentrate
down the center of pre-rolls, kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a Twinkie a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will inject them, whether it's
distillate or batter or whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that improves the THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also kind of changes the flavor profile of
the pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just recently we launched
something called Stardust, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: system that keeps the outside of
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you take your pre-roll that you
have kind of already finished and ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell, but then now you spray the outside
of it with distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you coat the Keef or you coat the
pre-roll with Keef or THCA crushed
[SPEAKER_01]: diamonds or bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it looks like a fuzzy pre-roll on
the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later this year we'll be selling
a system that takes those pre-rolls and
[SPEAKER_01]: then kind of decides whether you want to
put it, you know, crutch up or crutch down
[SPEAKER_01]: into a tube, seals it, puts a label on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that way we'll have, you know,
every step in the process for any pre-roll
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically our main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the types of quantities that
you're able to manufacture on an hourly or
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We previously interviewed a guest who it
seemed to be that they were churning out a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred million cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a lot of cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the kind of production capacity of
the machines?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the cone side, we have a machine
that can do up to 2,500 cones an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have another system that
will be able to do about a thousand to
[SPEAKER_01]: twelve hundred cones an hour, where we'll
be doing like blunts or cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a highly variable option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the infusion pieces of the
setup, let's see, the injection one,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had customers go all the way up to
like 1,500 joints per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the keeping side, that's
around, so far our max speed has been 1200
[SPEAKER_01]: joints per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of them are different speeds
depending on the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's kind of the approximate
speeds and feeds for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the technology that
you guys do use, obviously you're
[SPEAKER_00]: specializing in robotics at the moment,
but the likes of computer vision and some
[SPEAKER_00]: machine learning models, is there any
other applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine computer vision in the
cultivation world is something that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be implemented across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've done a bunch of computer
vision before, especially on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually first started in the
industry making computer vision powered
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass order.
[SPEAKER_01]: This way we could take hand trim and then
separate out all the constituent parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: hand trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means when we got large batches of hand
trim, we could take out all the small buds
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we could take out all the stems
and then we could take all the leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: separate them into different piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we could send the leaves to get
extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could throw the stems away to save on
taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we could take the buds and sell
them for pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a pretty interesting project
because the computer vision had to operate
[SPEAKER_01]: and make decisions within like 40
milliseconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did some more research on that to
understand if we could even do a phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: classification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did pretty well there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of noticed that at the moment
when we made that, so that was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first things that we made about four
years ago, the cannabis industry was still
[SPEAKER_01]: too new to absorb a technology like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these days that'll be a bit more
important, but I have seen some computer
[SPEAKER_01]: vision on the growers side to kind of like
analyze the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw one machine that was trying to
do computer vision scanning to see if any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the flowers are herming at a very high
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you'd have to like walk through
rows of plants and like check for seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's some kind of like color
markers that you can do and do like a high
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum kind of analysis for the plants
to see like if they're kind of going awry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a few applications,
especially in the cultivation side,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because otherwise you have to absorb
every plant and inspect them one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were some of the initial
challenges that you faced when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: building the robotics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the hardware or the software side of
things, which is the biggest headache or
[SPEAKER_00]: are they equally difficult things to
overcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you're doing robotics,
it's not really just like a hardware and
[SPEAKER_01]: software individual approach, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they got to play nice together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like twice as hard as either
doing one of those independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like three times as hard because it's
got to work together, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that interface is always very dicey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just depends on like what the
approach is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like for example, the first
system that we built, the Roka Sorter,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was our kind of top level,
very first product into the market not the
[SPEAKER_01]: canvas market, but the e-commerce market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was really difficult because it
was both a very complicated material
[SPEAKER_01]: handling problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is some sophisticated
computer vision to recognize things and to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that that was reliable enough
that the system would even be valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the computer vision wasn't top
notch, then it didn't even matter what you
[SPEAKER_01]: did on the hardware side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of those problems where
they were both equally as hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just kind of wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it came to the, let's say
the biomass sorter that we made,
[SPEAKER_01]: that one was almost completely software
side, what made it difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardware side was really just like
recreating some expired patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a waterfall of agriculture,
or like you have a bunch of material that
[SPEAKER_01]: falls off a ramp and then you shoot it
with puffs of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one was very much software based
because there was a lot of timing
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The computer vision was really
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess if you think about GECO,
that one was very much a hardware based
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The software was more just like control
software.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a bit simplified.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the actual implementation of the
control software and making sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware was extremely uniform,
extremely well refined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way you could control the dosage
of this concentrate into joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a lot of little things that
you have to get right on the hardware to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure it's a consistent product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that one definitely took a while
and especially because concentrates have a
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very wide range of operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if your machine doesn't have the
ability to at least like accept that wide
[SPEAKER_01]: range, it's not incredibly useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to make it very, very variable,
very variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was very much like a hardware
problem for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it depends which part of the
value chain we're kind of going after
[SPEAKER_01]: because sometimes it's less software and
sometimes it's more hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just really depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the level of skill required for
somebody to work one of these machines?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine the dream scenario for you
guys is that these machines are dotted in
[SPEAKER_00]: different factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in different industries all across
the world and are able to produce X type
[SPEAKER_00]: of quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a special skill set that's
required to work the robots or is it an
[SPEAKER_00]: easier barrier to entry to hire staff to
manage these facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a saying here whenever we
design a machine for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, it's we want to make sure that
the machines are able to be operated by
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who is not sophisticated at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they haven't, they didn't even
graduate high school and they're high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can be intoxicated and be like 16
years old because in many cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that are operating the
machines, they might be migrant workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not even speak English and
other states, they might be coming back
[SPEAKER_01]: from their break where they just smoked
their joint or took like a dab rip and
[SPEAKER_01]: then went back into their manufacturing
company to continue to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, we make the
machines themselves be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when we troubleshoot,
we make it so that if you just follow the
[SPEAKER_01]: directions, they're pretty straightforward
to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also provide this pretty robust
customer support system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of our systems ship with a
dedicated Slack channel, which is like an
[SPEAKER_01]: internal tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows us to communicate between teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows us to be very,
very deeply embedded in our customers
[SPEAKER_01]: operations of the machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get to see if anything goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have like remote support as well
to see if anything goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually like log into the machine
and see the video operations of the
[SPEAKER_01]: machines working to debug what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I specifically made it such that we
don't have to have like some automation
[SPEAKER_01]: technician running the machines because
those don't really exist in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that quality of workers is really just
too expensive to make the operation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine financially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are one of the premier technology
companies that's innovating in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking forward to seeing the
most over the next 12 to 24 months?
[SPEAKER_01]: So specifically for our company,
I think I would be really, really excited
[SPEAKER_01]: to see when we finally get our kind of
fully automated line all stitched
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something we've been working on for
the past couple of years to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, modular segments, kind of like
what I described right now, which is all
[SPEAKER_01]: of our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're really working on now is
making it so that each one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: segments can be either used independently
or you can kind of snug them all together
[SPEAKER_01]: and have a fully automated line where one
machine hands off to another machine,
[SPEAKER_01]: which hands off to another machine,
which hands off to another machine and
[SPEAKER_01]: have that whole line be able to be
operated by one individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that'd be really cool,
especially for the three puts that we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Considering the current market size in the
different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would also like to see it just to
help the whole industry as well as some
[SPEAKER_01]: form of federal changes, at least in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a pretty significant
boon to the worldwide cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Europe now finally has Germany who
just approved, which they thought they
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to do it last year,
but now I guess they're doing it this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sounds like a good thing for the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think once the United States kind of,
I don't know, figures out whatever their
[SPEAKER_01]: plan is, then we're going to see a
significant change globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: As if the reserve currency finds it legal
and safe to bank, then everyone else
[SPEAKER_01]: should probably find that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be exciting couple of
years for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who hasn't ever visited a
sorting robots website, it's below in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description where you're watching or
listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend following them on all
social media and checking out Notal's page
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notal, thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode.
