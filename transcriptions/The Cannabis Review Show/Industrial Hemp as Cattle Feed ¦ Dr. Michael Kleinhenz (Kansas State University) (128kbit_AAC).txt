[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Dr. Michael Steinhans, who's assistant
[SPEAKER_00]: professor of beef production in medicine
at Kansas State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about a topic of
industrial hemp as cattle feed on today's
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during my research, I came up with a
lot of different names that you've seen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the country in the thick of the midst of
this exact topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Ireland is such a farming heavy
nation, it's a topic I wanted to cover for
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of how you got into the beef
[SPEAKER_00]: production medicine side of things and
where you are at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I am at Kansas State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on faculty and clinical sciences here
and beef production veterinarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally am Ohio native, so I came
from Midwest and was in private practice
[SPEAKER_01]: for a handful of years and found my way
back to do a PhD in clinical pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am now on faculty here at Kansas
State.
[SPEAKER_01]: My research interests are pharmacologics
that are involved in pain mitigation and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for ways to measure pain in food
production animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys on my research actually come
across a load of stats that I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know agriculture is the largest employer
in Kansas and a large chunk of the state
[SPEAKER_00]: is given up to the agricultural sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it was as big as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no better case study than you
guys to be able to be researching this
[SPEAKER_00]: first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the research I've had,
the biomass from hemp seems to be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: source of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fats for a cow to you as biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the transaction of the milk being
given to the calf from the mother is the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of concernation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how far am I off on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here in the United States,
our Food and Drug Administration has come
[SPEAKER_01]: straight out and said that feeding
cannabinoids to any food production animal
[SPEAKER_01]: or any animal, in fact, is considered an
adulterant in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is not legal here in the United
States to feed any sort of cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant matter, CBD oil, hemp meal,
things like that to any animal,
[SPEAKER_01]: even your companion animals like your dogs
and cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to figure out the safety
profiles of those, which is kind of odd
[SPEAKER_01]: because the FDA considers hemp seed here
to be generally regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't feed it to your dogs,
but you can give it to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's kind of some confusion as to
what the laws are and what's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of our big research and part of
our USDA funding is to kind of answer
[SPEAKER_01]: those questions of if a cow happens to be
fed industrial hemp, do those cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: enter the system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do they go into that animal's body?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it does enter the milk,
how long is it in the milk?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm at what level?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and do you guys have a set time of
execution for these studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a point where you're going to
sign off and be able to give the FDA or
[SPEAKER_00]: something approval and say, look,
we can categorically prove that this does
[SPEAKER_00]: not hinder the process or it does in XY?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've completed two studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one single dose study out in
publication now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a multi-dose study that we have
under review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now and the peer review literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also completed a tissue residue
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used the FDA's guidance for
industry, how they approve drugs and food
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you give a drug to a cow,
the way they measure how long that safety
[SPEAKER_01]: period from when that animal is injected
to when that animal can enter the food
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We followed those study guidelines and
we're currently analyzing that study for
[SPEAKER_01]: edible tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So muscle can enter any fat and liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plan to do a milk production,
a milk transfer and study the first part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the goal for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have that data wrapped up by the
end of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see a lot of the cows fed on
soy feed over in the US as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the kind of primary source of feed
for cows or for cattle?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for cattle, here depends on the type of
beef cattle here in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are grazed or fed hay over
the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are given a, let's call it total
mixed ration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically everything into a big pot and
fed out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our dairies are fed primarily on total
mixed rations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is provided in a big,
you know, be like a salad bar all mixed up
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put in front of you on your
plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but the main source of protein,
a lot of those is alfalfa and soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's push, especially in the
poultry industry for hemp seed to work in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and as a protein source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because hemp seed meal, so the extract
after they remove the oil is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: similar composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit different fatty acid profile,
but the protein content is very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a push in the poultry industry
to kind of replace some of the soybeans
[SPEAKER_01]: oil meal with the hemp meal for that fatty
acid profile is what they're going after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think you've got the two pronged
attract of you've got lower carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to utilize a biomass that's
being thrown to the wayside initially
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, you've kind of got two markets,
one being able to create jobs and revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: and another being able to less reliant on
an import coming from it, a foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our, one of our big pushes for Western
Kansas and we have a lot of farmland out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that's irrigated and ran off what's
called the Onaga aquifer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a finite amount of water
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those producers are looking for ways
to basically reduce any amount of water
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to use to grow crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a big push out that way to
use things like hemp because it uses so
[SPEAKER_01]: much less water compared to traditional
row crops like corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second topic I wanted to jump out is if
the farmland grown version of hemp has a
[SPEAKER_00]: trace amount of THC and that seems to be
the barrier for entry for it being used as
[SPEAKER_00]: a product, what are the options of
synthetic versus farm grown for providers
[SPEAKER_00]: of feed for cattle and for farm animals?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, when you talk synthetic,
do you mean like a plant that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: modified with no THC or do you mean a
singular cannabinoid, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a specific set of group of cannabinoid
or a mixture or a combination,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say that's a formula some company
might develop themselves as an IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be here in the United
States, those would automatically be
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled as drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're starting to go, you go
completely away from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a four inch type diet that's feed to a
drug and feed drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole set of different
regulations here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, the FDA has come out and they
have said, you know, THC is one drug they
[SPEAKER_01]: consider a drug and they also consider
cannabidiol here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD to be a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because there's an FDA approved
formulation for humans for seizure
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they consider, automatically they
consider that a drug because they have an
[SPEAKER_01]: approved cannabidiol label here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two that would meet a lot
of pushback from the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones they would, if they were
pure chemicals, they would still consider
[SPEAKER_01]: those a drug by definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd have to go through those
formal approval processes, which are quite
[SPEAKER_01]: lengthy and quite a bit of an investment
on the backend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's the only thing that you
could have one major, one or two people
[SPEAKER_00]: who've got the capital to be able to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got the ability to be able to
make a product that are they the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: may be able to cut out the farming
industry from being able to use that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue source?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the big concern they would
have then also they would probably also
[SPEAKER_01]: know that farmers being farmers,
if it's green and they can feed it to a
[SPEAKER_01]: calf, they're going to try to feed it
somewhere along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way a lot of producers here in
the United States are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a lower cost, but a similar
product in the end, they're going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: for the more economical choice when it
comes to feeding cattle, because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest expense we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the United States for feeding
animals, for raising animals is that feed
[SPEAKER_01]: intake and putting feed into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think a farm is a perfect
example of having a circular economy in
[SPEAKER_00]: the one space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use everything for something
at some stage along the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cattle are, you know, in the United
States are wonderful recyclers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people appreciate how much
biomass from the food industry actually
[SPEAKER_01]: ends up into cattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, anything from potato chip waste
to carrot waste to vegetable waste that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's not fit to enter the
human food chain, but it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can still enter the cattle chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as the ethanol industry here
in the United States really relies on as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cattle feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of cattle here in Kansas are
fed distillers grains from our ethanol
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost to the point where the
distiller grains drive the ethanol
[SPEAKER_01]: industry more than the ethanol drives the
ethanol industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last topic I just wanted to bring up
is, do you guys do much research on the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and other farm
animals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something that is even being
researched at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure if it works for cows,
you know, the ECS is in most mammals,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so we do not do endocannabinoid
research in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the current time, we just aren't set up
for it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're focusing kind of on the food safety
aspect as well as the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: transference of cannabinoids in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We originally got into this industrial
hemp just looking to see if cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a useful tool for analgesics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were quickly taken back by how
little data was out there and how much had
[SPEAKER_01]: to be filled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're still trying to fill in those
voids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we even get to our original goal
for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is some research out there,
particularly in dairy cattle, looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system around the time of
calving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some interesting data out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's upregulated during the time
of the postpartum period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a cow gives birth, that system's
upregulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The receptors are, as well as once they
have found more cattle that have
[SPEAKER_01]: endometritis with an infection,
and their uterus or inflammation of their
[SPEAKER_01]: uterus have increased endocannabinoids
circulating in their system in those
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot to learn about that system and
how it plays into the balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation because all inflammation is
not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to figure out how to,
you know, balance it so we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: completely shut off a system that we know
is useful, you know, kind of like the Cox
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know parts of it are very useful and we
just want to shut off parts, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to shut off the whole thing
and cause, you know, renal issues and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just coming up to our time now,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could actually talk to you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been highly informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the work you guys are doing there
might be going under the radar for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people, but it's cutting edge stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you guys open up the door for
a potential new, we can put random figures
[SPEAKER_00]: on these industries like people do,
but a potentially lucrative industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be homegrown and a circular economy
within the United States and replicated in
[SPEAKER_00]: different territories around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to learn about this plant,
where it can fit into our production
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the varieties of biomass that
are, you know, considered byproducts and
[SPEAKER_01]: how those can fit into cattle rations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a bit of variety there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all parts of the plant could
be and biomass can somehow fit into a
[SPEAKER_01]: cattle ration pretty easily here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think it's a lot of people
with the sustainability and have been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop their own feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the research you guys are going
to do should lay the groundwork for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we're a farming heavy industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been practiced over here to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just needs the validation of
scientific papers like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for coming on,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can chat again maybe in a
year and we can touch face and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's going for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
