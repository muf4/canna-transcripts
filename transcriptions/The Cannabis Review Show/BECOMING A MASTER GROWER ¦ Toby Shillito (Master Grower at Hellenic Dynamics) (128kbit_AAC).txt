[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined by this episode
by Toby Shalido who's the master grower at
[SPEAKER_01]: Hellenic Dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today Toby?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lovely to be with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no finer topic of conversation on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it mate, so no better person to be
able to go through this for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you came into
[SPEAKER_01]: Hellenic Dynamics and your position there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last four years, which is
basically the legal medical time in the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, I've designed five different
large-scale medical cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities in different countries in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming into Hellenic, I was attracted by
the idea that Greece has got a really low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got land, labour and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a direct export route to
Germany, which of course is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting market at the moment in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it certainly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with the scale back announcement that
they made, I still think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: room for growth for companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be a complete waterfall
and dilution initially at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes refining the process and having
a little bit of delay could be good for
[SPEAKER_01]: the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the legalisation model is a
reflection of the dominant model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Political culture, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Germany, quite surprisingly,
they've gone for a much less regulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: much less corporate, if you like,
much less, if you suppose, capitalistic
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my heart, I welcome that very much
in terms of spreading the benefits of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant throughout society as class and with
some equality, as you can possibly hope
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Onto the cultivation side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between just a
normal grower and a master grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: How big of a chasm is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years of experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it an extra layer of knowledge,
let's say biology or chemistry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain a little bit on that,
please?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously, there's no one size fits
all exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key differences will be around
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're bringing a very different
approach to the HVAC and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just doing everything much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty obvious and fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part is the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working within a highly,
highly regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're thinking about GMP regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking about GACP criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking about all of the
pharmaceutical processes, batch master
[SPEAKER_00]: records, secure storage and a lot of the
other elements that the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your legacy growers, if you like,
won't really have to think about at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're doing some trade-offs really
in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things in the medical world
of growing, of master growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are a lot of processes that
you can't, you don't have really free
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a legacy grower, you make
choices, you find a line through the
[SPEAKER_00]: various trade-offs about the equipment and
the process you're going to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will stick to that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found less freedom, I think,
to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you're really going to be
almost bound to use some substrate such as
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell, an inert substrate such as
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably not going to be using
living organic soil, which in some ways is
[SPEAKER_00]: a shame because you've got to use that
cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to think about the labor cost
of inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the legacy time, you're not
thinking, you're simply aiming only for
[SPEAKER_00]: what pleases you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in that process,
you've got a lot of other hurdles,
[SPEAKER_00]: stability testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your product can't just come out of your
facility and go straight to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to go through a pharmaceutical
process of checking, certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, checking on the stability to see
how long the shelf life will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of those things that are
constraining, I suppose, but ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: irrelevant to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those intellectual steps and
pharmaceutical steps that you'll need to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the ultimate aim, of course,
for uniformity of the product and thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how you can please a medical
pharmaceutical audience rather than,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose, your friends and someone in
your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recently spoke to Professor Anna Schwab
and she uses aquaponics in 420 Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of cultivation methods do you
guys employ that make the product more
[SPEAKER_01]: unique than, let's say, some of the other
market competitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: We try and keep it as simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got tables, we've got drippers,
we've got Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's really all about the three major
things that I've absolutely got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get the genetics right,
I've got to get the lights, their
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity and spectrum right, and I've got
to get the HVAC right so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: control the humidity and temperature to
exactly the right recipe for those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without the ability to control your
genetics, your lighting and your HVAC,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you get those right,
they're taking you, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of the way to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of it, the CO2 injection,
the fertilizers and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: are quite small increments in terms of
your success criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it comes to post-harvest,
the mastery and scientific artistry that's
[SPEAKER_01]: required for that element of the,
shall we say, is that something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: gained over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: True trial and error is again,
is that kind of the last level of the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer game type thing that once you
master the post-processing, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee your product is going to be
replicable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I spend more time worrying
about my post-harvest than I do about the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual cultivation or horticulture a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might sound a bit strange,
but a bit like for the wine guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow good grapes, you can only destroy
their quality as you turn them into wine
[SPEAKER_00]: and the vinification system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the same with cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow great flowers and you can
only ever lose their value as you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not after the flower itself,
we're after the trichome, that very
[SPEAKER_00]: fragile, glassy little mushroom-shaped
thing on the outside of that plant where
[SPEAKER_00]: all the magic is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are very, very delicate
components of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even just shaking the plant a little in
the air means those trichomes will detach,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the head of those trichomes
will detach and will float in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're smelling them, they've moved
in the air up your nostril and it means
[SPEAKER_00]: they haven't then gone into the product or
into the medicine at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the kind of some of the
biggest challenges that you face as a
[SPEAKER_01]: master grower in the UK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there massive hurdles compared to,
let's say, what's happening in Greece?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you compare the two areas for
the ability to cultivate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both emerging areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the UK, you've got maybe a dozen
cultivation licenses, probably only four
[SPEAKER_00]: or five of which are going to go beyond
the research and development phase and get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the wonderful thing about Greece is
you've got open export routes to the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real problem, I think, with the UK
cultivators, A, you've got a higher cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of production, naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: B, you don't have any sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really crucially, you can't export.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the success of your business
and your cultivation regime is entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the growth of medical patient
demand in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as most observers would say,
that hasn't been as rapid or as solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of churn in the market for
the patients, as we'd all hoped in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last four and a half years that we've been
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to what's happened
around Europe, it looks interesting now
[SPEAKER_01]: that it could end up potentially be the
grow at home laws get approved in most
[SPEAKER_01]: countries for two or three plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that side of the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like on research I've done already,
if you do like the top 10 cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industries in America, like Scott's
Miracle Grow must be two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: billion bigger than every other other
cannabis company there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a European equivalent over here,
or have they got patents and IPs and
[SPEAKER_01]: processes in place where it's just going
to be done the exact same as they've done
[SPEAKER_01]: in America over in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, on the indoor grows, it doesn't
really matter where you are in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking seriously about your
electricity cost and your labor cost and
[SPEAKER_00]: those are your major determinants of
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a transportable recipe that you
can implant in any insulated space with an
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity and water supply broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: More complicated when you get to glass
house growing where you've got to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear about keeping control over the
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is where some
non-cannabis growers, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers, they'll be very good at producing
a very uniform crop at a very large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes they trip over their
previous experience in that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think clearly enough about the
post-harvest bit that we just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tomato gets harvested, broadly it sits
at a certain temperature and humidity in a
[SPEAKER_00]: storage area and it doesn't particularly
degrade in its quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see a lot of the American
growers often have an experienced legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: grower working a lot alongside a tomato or
pepper horticulturalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the little question I wonder about is
the political one about who actually
[SPEAKER_00]: really calls the shots out of those two
when it comes down to a difference of
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the Czech government doing,
let's say going to step further than what
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany have announced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's going to be on par
pretty much similar of what they've done?
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw the Uruguayan, a similar model to
Uruguay where it's five grams per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have details on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the Czech is going to be
really an interesting market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's a mass involved here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 10 million people in Czech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 85 million in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you would expect that the Germans
will have to produce in another way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we really want?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want access for all the people who want
it, medical or not really at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the UK, we're a good probably
five or 10 years behind some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries you just mentioned in
Europe, a country of 68 million people
[SPEAKER_00]: with, I would say, there's no data,
but I would say at least two million
[SPEAKER_00]: regular consumers of cannabis in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's an attractive market to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of the larger companies,
and I talk to many of them regularly from
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, from Canada and so on,
they're all looking at the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for those trigger points to enter
that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it when GPs get to prescribe or is
it when patient numbers reach 100,000 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the UK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, there are large companies
waiting to pounce on the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at the moment, really,
we're very much in the foothills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've had four and a half
years of experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a really long way for
us to go in the UK in terms of matching
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory framework with the huge
opportunity to build a new business here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everyone knows the common sense
reasons for liberalizing or destigmatizing
[SPEAKER_00]: or decriminalizing or whatever you want to
say, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise some taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use skills of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop wasting police time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop the stabbings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these social and environmental
benefits can be picked up by a sensible,
[SPEAKER_00]: progressive liberalization model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really sorry to say that the UK
government hasn't gone on that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's from outside looking in,
you try and wonder who's worse for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both seem to be charging against each
other to have nothing but negative things
[SPEAKER_01]: to say about the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a citizens assembly on drugs
legalization in Ireland happening at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment with all the expert politicians and
a number of advisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that the guards
brought up is the difficulty that would
[SPEAKER_01]: end up happening with the UK if we went
off and decriminalized a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it seems we're going to be bound
by each other, by the decisions one or
[SPEAKER_01]: other makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This speaks fundamentally to the heart of
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here half a mile away from
Westminster, apparently the seat of all
[SPEAKER_00]: political thought or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we're way behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keir Starmer has his own reasons for being
clean and getting himself and his Labour
[SPEAKER_00]: Party elected without any contentious
parts of their manifesto.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Conservative Party perhaps has a more
libertarian side to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But neither party, I think, is taking this
issue seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the destigmatization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heartbreaking to see governments
going year after year without really
[SPEAKER_00]: grasping this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're not careful, the states will
liberalize federally at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won't have built an industry in
this country that can compete with what is
[SPEAKER_00]: to come from North America in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time is against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opportunity is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems a great shame that neither of
the political parties in the UK is really
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it sensibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've set up a framework and good on
them, fair enough, for, if you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: by exception, liberalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're exceptionally ill, sadly,
or you can have an exceptional part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite right, four and a half years ago
in the UK, they could no longer hold back
[SPEAKER_00]: the floodgates of public demand for
cannabis-based oils for childhood
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, for example, or the incredible
benefits of being able to manage,
[SPEAKER_00]: not cure, but manage a long-term illness
like multiple sclerosis or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and perhaps end-of-life care too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And great, it was not possible for
politicians to hold back that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't go nearly far enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a big difference between,
there's no difference in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical cannabis is the same as any other
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a difference in the approach
and the market and the ability to build
[SPEAKER_00]: the infrastructure to serve and to take
money away from people on the criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things who are not always thinking
about the best social and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of their production systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, here, Toby, here, here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just hit our time, but thank you
very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an absolutely great
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope we can touch base again towards the
end of this year and have part two of this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to know more about
Hellenic Dynamics, there's the website
[SPEAKER_01]: below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend checking them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toby, thank you very much, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for everybody else, we shall see you
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
