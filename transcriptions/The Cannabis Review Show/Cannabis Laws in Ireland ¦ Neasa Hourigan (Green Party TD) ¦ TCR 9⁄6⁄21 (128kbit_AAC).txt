[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined in this
episode by Nessa Horgan, who is the Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Party TD.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, Nessa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very delighted to have you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the first person from the
government that we've had an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to speak and put a few questions to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much for taking your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're very busy in your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: First person from the government,
I'm worried now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, this is a business show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nothing more than basically trying
to provide some information and education
[SPEAKER_00]: to any of the viewers who are looking,
young entrepreneurs or people looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: pivot into this industry, which will be an
exciting new sector regardless of the
[SPEAKER_00]: political party in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an if not when now,
or when not if.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the first thing I wanted to
talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep you in and out in within
the time slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the laws that Ireland have
are not in tandem with the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you aware of the European ruling that
happened in relation to the regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: TOC quantities in hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think increasingly what we're seeing
is other jurisdictions and countries
[SPEAKER_01]: moving beyond Ireland's understanding of
the cannabis issue and hemp issue and THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a real recognition of not just the
medicinal qualities of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the therapeutic qualities of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, I think, whereas we do need
to probably reform from my point of view,
[SPEAKER_01]: we definitely need to reform domestically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there's a serious question
now around bringing ourselves into line
[SPEAKER_01]: with the European norm, because we do live
within a community of nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it only makes sense that for trade and
for business, we have similar standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that in medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we need to make sure that
we align very well in this area,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who do you think is the person that is
responsible for enacting that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a series of people working in the
background working on this specific party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something that can happen to be
able to enact that further and to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: some of, let's say, the clampdowns that
have happened on some of the stores like
[SPEAKER_00]: Blooms and Little Collins, which have kind
of been completely unnecessary and seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a waste of taxpayer money just
because there hasn't been a catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: within the European ruling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific person that needs to
do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we saw those kind of
incidents, it just shows how lacking in
[SPEAKER_01]: clarity our own domestic policies are and
how the Gardaí will take their instruction
[SPEAKER_01]: from legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when there's a lack of clarity there,
they'll revert to the status quo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think those very unfortunate
incidents, and I'm sure incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult for the people involved,
really show that the EU community in which
[SPEAKER_01]: we live has moved beyond what our domestic
law is capable of dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it straddles a number of
departments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be something, I think,
for the enterprise department to consider,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, if you're talking about the
EU region, that's something that they
[SPEAKER_01]: should be concerning themselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, a lot of the regulation
would be happening in the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something that we're going to need
collaboration across a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: departments to get right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that it implies a
requirement for greater reform more
[SPEAKER_01]: generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there's any blame that
needs to be put towards the guards in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're following basically laws
that they're told to enact, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: no ability to be able to understand the
difference between what a CBD board or
[SPEAKER_00]: flower looks like compared to a THC board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is it, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that more generally,
politicians aren't the experts on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because usually what you're doing is
you're trying to get the experts in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the experts are not just the
professional experts or the business
[SPEAKER_01]: experts, but also the people who have the
lived experience of what the impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: particular legislation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really important to kind of
start listening to what people's
[SPEAKER_01]: on-the-ground experience of this kind of
thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, the Gardaí are not expected
to be experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be instructed how to deal with
certain legislation or the lack thereof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, they're sometimes in a very
difficult position.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, my experience of Gardaí is
that they are very well aware of the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of spectrum of usage that's involved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just that we don't necessarily
have the legislative framework in place to
[SPEAKER_01]: help them to do their job well in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the trends that's going
to be happening and growing bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger that probably at the very start now
was kind of the cruxus of the issue is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability for CBD flower to be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've never seen that on the market
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been kind of illegal,
illicit, high THC content where that
[SPEAKER_00]: European ruling allows for a CBD flower to
be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that understanding from the
guards and the retailer that is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the little hole in that area there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the next topics I want to jump onto
is the biggest fears from politicians on a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it basically lack of education on the
topic here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it won't somebody please think of
the children type screaming from the roof?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a direct reason why there's such
a hindrance again?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a bit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, during the
government negotiations we had,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was probably one of the most fraught
conversations that we had with our
[SPEAKER_01]: government partners because our own policy
would be to make it a category four drug
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we would be promoting the
creation of cannabis cafes and that there
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a legal pathway, like a fully
legal taxed legal pathway to the provision
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that did elicit reactions that I would
say are kind of fear based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the phrases I heard a lot was
that it's a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that my reaction to that is
always it is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it is a gateway drug now because
it's an illegal drug and you place people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the realm of criminal behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, if you want to access any
of these products, you often have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: an engagement with criminal actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, you know, it's it's more
likely that that misuse would escalate
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're into that world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have through a lack of, you know,
moving with with the times and moving with
[SPEAKER_01]: the requirement for new legislation,
we have created a situation where this
[SPEAKER_01]: product can be can be a gateway drug
because it moves people into an area that
[SPEAKER_01]: they shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be something that is is
legal and regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that my there is a definite and
genuine concern for younger people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't discount that and I
wouldn't underplay that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my my feeling is that that is mostly
based on not a direct experience of the
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that and I know we're going to
talk later about the way forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's incredibly important that
we expose both the general public and
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians to the reality of what this
means for people, both the reality of what
[SPEAKER_01]: a more legal framework would would would
provide for people and how it might
[SPEAKER_01]: safeguard them, but also the reality of
what we do right now, which is place them
[SPEAKER_01]: in contact with gangs and illegal and
criminal conduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also make them incredibly unsafe
because the product isn't regulated and
[SPEAKER_01]: people can be imbibing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just more about educating
them and making that information available
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an argument that,
you know, or it's a discussion that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be really useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could win the argument by simply
placing all of the facts on the table and
[SPEAKER_01]: having an honest, not fear based
discussion around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the simplest way to try and
explain to some of the politicians that is
[SPEAKER_00]: if their teenage child is going out in to
to, let's say, test something,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's alcohol or whatever it is,
kids are kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to get into some sort of
mischief at some stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, if you're going to get into
cannabis, your only market is to go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dealer who's also selling them cocaine,
could also sell them pills, could also
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them a myriad of other drugs where
the option should be that there's a cafe
[SPEAKER_00]: that sells CBD flour that has no THC in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is a route into this,
into smoking cannabis or consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in any way, shape or form,
that it's the most template, template
[SPEAKER_00]: version you could possibly get as opposed
to they're sending kids out into scenarios
[SPEAKER_00]: that's either going to harden them or be
send them down the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, it's there is
a real spectrum of opinion about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that people's politicians,
particularly, are overly influenced by an
[SPEAKER_01]: older, more conservative voter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are the people that vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also there's always a framing
on all political action like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am worried that even as we kind of start
to make more progress on kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal side of things and we start to
see reform there, that all of the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: three parties are really still at the
stage of maybe considering
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to me, decriminalization is in some
ways the worst of all worlds, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still an unregulated drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't really protect that young
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's really my my my
concern here is that, like, I would be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from the place where, look,
on balance and I'm not under I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: undercutting or saying that there is no
negative aspects to cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I of course, I completely agree that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I and I take those very seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on balance, I would prefer to trust
people and help them to make decisions in
[SPEAKER_01]: a safe way than have a draconian criminal
legislation around the issue and put all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the actual decision making in the hands
of criminal gangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I couldn't agree with you more on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move on to the last topic
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do, I just want to get clarity on
we basically talk to pretty much most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Minister for Health who's
responsible for any legislation that would
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody can agree on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the person who does make the
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the Justice Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the realm within which the Department
of Health to make this reform discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's my understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it would be a regulated drug,
it would be in that public health and
[SPEAKER_01]: well-being area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I've been talking to
Minister Frank Fien around pushing forward
[SPEAKER_01]: the Drugs Citizens Assembly, which I know
we're going to talk about now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that he would be in the Department for
Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although I have to say, as we move
through, there absolutely would be issues
[SPEAKER_01]: around like, well, how would we regulate
it then?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be an issue for justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how to tax us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really important part of us,
because obviously we don't want to tax it
[SPEAKER_01]: out of existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it still remains in the way
cigarettes have become so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's a whole kind of criminal
enterprise around cheap cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to maybe there's a sliding
scale of taxation around the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent in a good taxation system to the
chairman of the revenue and got a reply
[SPEAKER_00]: from the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the different departments need to
come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody needs to put on their
leadership hat and realize that this
[SPEAKER_00]: population that's getting old are all used
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as if they're that older
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 14, 50 year olds now have lived
through nightclubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lived through socializing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as if it's a different mentality
mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to want to have a
comfortable later on in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the products that will
be available to somebody who's 50 or 60
[SPEAKER_00]: with arthritis or a number of other
different ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm conscious of the time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get you out on the last topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way forward, is it a citizens
assembly or what do you suggest is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way forward for the industry to get
legalized and around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as I said, we in the Greens have for
a long time been supportive of kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reform in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our policy is for cannabis cafes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a fully regulated provision,
like a pathway to supply and that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could have your own personal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it was very important to us
to get something in support for government
[SPEAKER_01]: around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're dealing with two parties who
really don't share our views at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a very heated discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we got in the end was the
citizens assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I suppose my view on this is that
there genuinely is very strong opinions on
[SPEAKER_01]: both sides on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people want to see it completely
criminalized and absolutely nothing and
[SPEAKER_01]: won't accept that the kind of war on drugs
strategy has kind of failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other hand, you have people who
want absolutely no regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to be able.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a natural thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just everybody do what they want
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, in a world where we're
starting to tax sugar because we know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bad, I don't think that that's reasonable
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the best thing to do is to get
everybody in a room and then nobody has to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the answer going into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll come out with the answer
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what a citizens assembly does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where there is a social issue,
where there's a real and genuine and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to say, even those who I strongly
disagree with on the full criminalization
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things, their concerns are genuine
and need to be heard and need to be taken
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously, where there's a genuine fear
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would liken this to repeal,
getting people in that room and allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: them to consider all of the science and
all of the lived experience and come to
[SPEAKER_01]: some serious conclusions around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's the best way forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the three larger parties support
legalization fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, there is no legislative
route with the larger parties to get there
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can get us into the assembly
that's based on hearing testimony and
[SPEAKER_01]: based on those 100 people taking the time
to do it properly, I think that is a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to find that middle ground that works for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, the Irish public
generally are a little bit further along
[SPEAKER_01]: than politicians on a lot of social
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're further along on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're very mindful that
there's increasingly strong substances
[SPEAKER_01]: available out there that have cannabis
that's been sprayed with all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, high levels of we don't know what
spray it onto stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a real acceptance now that
we need to move ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see legalization,
but I don't need I think the great thing
[SPEAKER_01]: about the citizen assembly is I don't need
to have all of those answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we need to do is create a situation
where those 100 people can come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: some right answers that work for the Irish
context and for Irish society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both sides of the coin need to be heard
equally and that the facts should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to win the argument out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can ever help in reaching out and
finding people, I think the top five
[SPEAKER_00]: stories from either argument for and
against and have five real life stories
[SPEAKER_00]: for and against and see which ones are the
most compelling and offer the best
[SPEAKER_00]: argument for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you very much for your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be remiss if I didn't say to you,
will you ask Stephen Donnelly to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: Vera?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trending on Twitter again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lady has been going months spending
money that she shouldn't have to spend on
[SPEAKER_00]: the kids just to keep it safe when it's
basically just a simple little inaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a law over here that could save this
woman a lot of hassle and make her life a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get him to talk to Vera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk to him about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very good for coming on the show
and you've given some great answers for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody to have a think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can help you in any way,
shape or form when anything moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, just reach out to us and you have
a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
