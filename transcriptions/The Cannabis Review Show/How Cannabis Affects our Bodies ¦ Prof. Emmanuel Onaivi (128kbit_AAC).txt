[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this show
by Dr. Emmanuel Onainvi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a professor at William Patterson
University in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, Emmanuel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the COVID life that we are all
getting used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my two vaccines already.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you're one of the lucky ones now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be on a foreign holiday soon,
some sort of sunshine for yourself soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm giving a seminar in Puerto
Vallarta in Mexico on the International
[SPEAKER_01]: Behavioral Neuroscience Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, my symposium with four
others from Japan, from Mexico and from
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all going to be talking about the
advances in the especially the CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's I'm delighted to have you on
the show to talk about these topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give people briefly a
little overview on your work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry so far and how you ended
up in William Patterson University?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long story, but I'll try to cut it
short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finished my PhD from the University
of Bradford in England in
[SPEAKER_01]: neuropharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved directly to the United States to
do my postdoctoral fellowship in the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory of the very prominent
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Dr. Billy Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, he's deceased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked especially on the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for 30 years now, I've been hooked on
this cannabinoid system research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has led to a number of numerous
discoveries, not just by my group,
[SPEAKER_01]: but by others that I've worked with in the
past, including the cloning of the CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors, the identification of different
systems that are involved in the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that has shed a lot of light in
the mechanism of action of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that the body, the human body
makes its own natural marijuana-like
[SPEAKER_01]: substances that are called
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would, during this presentation,
I will make more addition to this
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I've done research on your work
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, you're one of the gentlemen
that I've been looking forward to talking
[SPEAKER_00]: to by having this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm basically going to ask you a quick
question before we kick off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over in Ireland, we had this lobbying
group who are anti-cannabis, who basically
[SPEAKER_00]: came out saying that cannabis is the
biggest danger to children's mental health
[SPEAKER_00]: of the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is a rubbish statement,
somebody with the level of education that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good question, because yes,
why marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: The science, as you are going to hear me
talk about today, has exploded and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: significant new knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these myths and stigma that
still revolve around marijuana because of
[SPEAKER_01]: prejudice and prohibition, that cautionary
statement is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is children should not be exposed
or pregnant women should not be exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the brain is still developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for adult use, the current explosion
of cannabis use across the globe and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: very important for those advocates to know
that no one anymore can stop the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as medicine and as recreational
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you must also add that this is
not for children because their brain is
[SPEAKER_01]: still developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not for pregnant women at this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But paradoxically, I will show you that
even in the marijuana system or the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis system called endocannabinoids is
intricately involved in reproduction,
[SPEAKER_01]: is intricately involved in growth of the
newborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, this current knowledge,
new knowledge allows there's no medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: without side effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it allows the use of cannabis,
but with stipulation that this is not for
[SPEAKER_01]: children and this is not for pregnant
women.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for clearing that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the audience a little bit
about the advantages in cannabis research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things seem to be going on leaps and
bounds as new R&D happens in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as somebody is at the tip of the spear
of this sector, what would you see as the
[SPEAKER_00]: new advances that we can look forward to
seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of advances.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's explosive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for this is that these advances
in cannabis research had lagged behind
[SPEAKER_01]: other natural abuse drugs like morphine,
like cocaine, like tobacco because of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, years of prejudice and prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there has been an explosion,
as we said earlier, of new knowledge on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis research and it has been
transformed into mainstream science,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just mainstream science, but also in
Main Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stigma is being shared,
as I mentioned earlier, at breathtaking
[SPEAKER_01]: speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new knowledge, this new advances
include one, the decoding of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the decoding of the cannabis plant
genome, what that means is that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: now be able to cultivate cannabis
depending on what you want to use it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I will talk a little bit about
CBD also.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second major discovery, apart from the
human genome that has also been decoded
[SPEAKER_01]: and mapped, the next major discovery,
which is almost 10 years old now or more,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the discovery that the human body makes
its own natural cannabis like substances
[SPEAKER_01]: that are referred to as endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: First discovered in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide was first of these substances
discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide is a Sanskrit word,
meaning eternal bliss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, 2 AG, 2 arachidonic glycerol,
another cannabis like substance was also
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered in the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became very clear that there is no
cell in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no system in the human biology
that does not involve this natural
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even you and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me give you the first example.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, during fertilization, for the sperm
to fertilize the egg, you require this
[SPEAKER_01]: natural endocannabinoid to pierce through
the egg and fertilize the egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that egg is fertilized, that egg
travels through the fallopian tube and
[SPEAKER_01]: anchors in the uterus and the cell starts
to divide in biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that cell to implant an anchor in the
uterus, you require this natural marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: like substances, this endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that critical time, as I mentioned
already, during implantation, if a woman
[SPEAKER_01]: smokes marijuana, there might be the
propensity for miscarriage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm telling you right now is that
an appropriate level, a balanced level,
[SPEAKER_01]: a homeostatic level of this natural
marijuana like substances is very
[SPEAKER_01]: important for appropriate pregnancy for
you to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you to be born or for me to be born.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that baby is finally born,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The breast milk is now loaded with this
natural cannabis like substances to do
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: To give the baby appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appetite to feed and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In summary, what I just told you is that
this new discovery of this
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids that is important and
involved in all types of cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: component is very, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want more?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cloning and characterization of
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go to that next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one in terms of cannabinoid
receptors is the cloning and the
[SPEAKER_01]: characterizations of cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another significant advancement
because it became clear that the receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: that are activated, that are turned on by
this cannabis like substances,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the exogenous, the marijuana like
substances, because the marijuana like
[SPEAKER_01]: substances include, I mean, cannabis like
substances can exchange the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoid, the cannabis plant
contains over a hundred, let's just put it
[SPEAKER_01]: over a hundred chemicals, including the
tapins, including the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been now well studied because
the major psychoactive component of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is called THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are called cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why the one made by the human
body is called endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then many of these compounds have been
characterized and classified, including
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is referred to as cannabidiol,
which is now gaining a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_01]: across the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, these receptors, the major ones
that have been characterized so far is
[SPEAKER_01]: referred to as CB1 cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out that the CB1 cannabinoid
receptors is the most abundant binding
[SPEAKER_01]: site, the most abundant protein producing
the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CB1 cannabinoid receptors are the most
abundant binding site in the human brain
[SPEAKER_01]: and testes and the uterus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore they play a very significant
physiological role.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has been controversial was the
discovery of the CB2, where it became very
[SPEAKER_01]: prominent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CB2 receptor was previously cloned by
Monroe in England.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they cloned the CB2 cannabinoid
receptors, it was not found in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, for many years,
it was thought that it was not in neurons,
[SPEAKER_01]: neurons in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here was my major discovery that,
yes, this CB2 receptor is also in neurons
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's also in microglia cells,
the immune cells of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore this has changed now,
that cannabinoid controversy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I'm very happy to be
involved in any type of controversy at all
[SPEAKER_01]: in the globe, especially if you show that
you are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, one more point about
cannabinoid receptors, because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: many now that we are discovering,
they are called putative cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps there'll be CB3, CB4, CB5,
but between the CB1 and CB2, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: subtypes, subtypes of cannabinoid receptor
1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, depending on the species,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on which animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CB2 also in mice and humans that
we use for studies, there's also CB1A and
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1B for that characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more advancement that is surprising to
me is that you know yeast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeast is used to make bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeast is used to make beer that a lot of
people like to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now yeast can be used to make,
to genetically engineer cannabinoids for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis-based medicine for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a significant advancement and
exciting science, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're well full of information so far
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're meant to do 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a funny feeling we'll be going
longer than this with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll move on to the next topic,
and it's basically something that I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people think they know about,
but how does cannabis affect our bodies?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good, this is one of the
significant advances that has led for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis now that has unraveled our eyes
for cannabis to be used, not just for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, but also for recreation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medically, as I said, there's no part of
the human biology and physiology that does
[SPEAKER_01]: not have this cannabis system,
this endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, when the level is too high or
too low, especially in psychiatric issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see the involvement of this
system, whether it is too low or too high,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it needs to be brought to a
hemiostatic level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, you can see that there's a lot
of application in the way it affects the
[SPEAKER_01]: human body for medicinal use, whether it
is for anxiety, whether it is for
[SPEAKER_01]: depression, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other major issues and the
discoveries that what we call myths and
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma that surrounds the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: One prominent one is the fact that men
that who use marijuana or who use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, if I want to stick with
cannabis, they have low sperm count.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we now know anecdotally and from many
other scientific research in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States is that actually sperm count has
increased in men that use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just went over also how
fundamentally it is very involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction in our bodies, reproduction
between the sperm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called acrosome reaction in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the sperm fertilizes the egg,
as I said earlier, it is called acrosome
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The head of the sperm, the sperm is
carrying like a helmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it pierces through the egg,
it delivers the genetic material from the
[SPEAKER_01]: sperm to the egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that fusion, that fertilization
when it occurs indicates the undeniable
[SPEAKER_01]: use of cannabis for reproduction by the
human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why when there's hemiostatic
imbalance, then there could be
[SPEAKER_01]: miscarriage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other uses, including bone,
for example, in bone health, including
[SPEAKER_01]: skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you're going to see in the future,
the recreational use is beyond anyone to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop, especially I think maybe this is the
most important component in the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization for recreational use as well
as as well as medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be a quality control in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole of Canada marijuana is now
legal, even in in the in supermarkets
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can go to get whatever type of
cannabis, because there are different
[SPEAKER_01]: types, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis sativa, the cannabis sindika,
and there are subspecies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the care that is important is that when
there is quality control, then you cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: just be using cannabis that is illegal,
because if you go out to the streets to
[SPEAKER_01]: just get any type of cannabis now,
you don't know what is laced with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is accompanying that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means the regulation and the
quality control is very important for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal as well as recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other example is that there's
something called epileptic seizures in
[SPEAKER_01]: children.
[SPEAKER_01]: In epileptic seizures, there's the Dravet
syndrome, the Lennox-Dapstet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this syndrome in children,
two year old, the United States of
[SPEAKER_01]: America, the FDA has approved Epidiolex or
the CBD in particular for the use in
[SPEAKER_01]: childhood epileptic seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet the federal government of the United
States, it is still illegal to use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But different states now have now
legalized the use of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: recreationally, about 33 or 36,
and maybe about 11 or 12 inclusive for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, cannabis is very, very
promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis like substances in the human body
is very promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico just also approved that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands is being used in Netherlands
for different purposes for many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years, over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet the whole world is now waking up
that this is real good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This natural medicine is important in all
of our daily function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a green wave that just
sweeps the globe over the course of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't thank you enough for coming on
the show and sharing your knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: wisdom with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everybody got a huge amount of
knowledge from that show as much as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a great day, Emmanuel,
and hopefully we can chat again in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future and see how things have progressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let me see this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will indeed, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Emmanuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
