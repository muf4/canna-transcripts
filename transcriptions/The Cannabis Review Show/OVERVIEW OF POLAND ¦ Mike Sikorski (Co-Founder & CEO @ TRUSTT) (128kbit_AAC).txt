[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Mike Sarkowski.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the co-founder and CEO at Trust
Software Platform in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how are you doing, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to learn all about what's going
on in Poland because I'm hearing lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: movement and news.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was contradictory to the laws that
are currently in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to start off, can you maybe give
everybody just a brief little under 60
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds overview of how you guys came to
set up trust in your position in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we are we are trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on a mission to make cannabis safer
for patients and less risky for
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are developing a next generation
blockchain and artificial enabled supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain verification tracking and
verification platform for Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In medical cannabis industry, we are in
this industry for the last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came here to disrupt it, to make it
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are experiencing delivering
technologies for the biggest brands and
[SPEAKER_01]: global brands around the world,
you know, in our previous kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis is an amazing business to be
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we came into it analyzing trends
and analyzing what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we stayed like a lot of people because
of, you know, it's pulling you in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the people in the industry are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the industry is growing in
the rapid pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think we can we can come with solutions
that bring that market to the full
[SPEAKER_01]: fruition and full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to jump straight into the first
topic, which is an overview of Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my reading and understanding is
Poland has a very strict personal drug
[SPEAKER_00]: laws like Ireland that there's not much
tolerance for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet I'm hearing at the same time a
potential flourishing medical industry
[SPEAKER_00]: because the laws have specific holes in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little brief rundown of what is happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in Poland at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: How strong is the medical industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is all the positive news coming
out for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Poland is obviously a huge market is 40
million people market with a huge,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, acceptance of medication and
self-medication, especially we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: by by normal pharmaceutical medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, from the kind of cannabis
perspective, two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the adult use cannabis is
illegal in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get up to three years for any size
of possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is being contested now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, with the recent government,
with the government we have now at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment, you know, and it may be difficult
and, you know, as we know around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the medical medical cannabis is it has
a huge potential in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, the medical cannabis was allowed
in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were 12 countries to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poland was 12 countries to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: From May 2022, the president signed off
the bill that allowed national research
[SPEAKER_01]: institutes to cultivate medical cannabis
for a domestic market.
[SPEAKER_01]: These institutes are supervised by the
Ministry of Agriculture that creates a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of other challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the market is growing and is rapidly
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2019, it was 42 million euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2021, it was 180 million euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's expected to double by 2026 to
over half a million euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, we're selling probably
around 1.7 tons of cannabis in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are over 9000 registered patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2021, over 30000 prescriptions were
provided in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Polish Pharmaceutical Chamber is
calculating a potential of number of
[SPEAKER_01]: Polish patients at around 300000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see that this market is ready to
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a number of clinics in Poland
prescribing medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually quite easy to get the
medical cannabis in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no list of diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is full freedom by the doctor to
prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes as long as 15 minutes
probably to get the telecall,
[SPEAKER_01]: teleprescription, televisit and get the
prescription for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, the market is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The possibility is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have challenges with product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had challenges last year with product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is more demand with supply at the
moment than supply in Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the hurdles that are hindering
access for patients in countries like
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland and Malta, which is a consultant
needs to sign off as well as the GP,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that is basically null and void
when it comes to Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the doctor is educated, he thinks
it's going to benefit the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to prescribe it and even
telemedicine is allowed, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to remember, every doctor can
prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not a lot of doctors are trained and
are feeling comfortable with prescribing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have this kind of this
growth of specialized clinics,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of groups, specialized doctors
who are then prescribing the medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis medicine to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, sounds very exciting, something that
we'd have to keep our eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing I wanted to jump on to that,
if you know anything about business and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've dealt with companies in Europe that
Poland is one of the hubs of cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing and software design when it
comes to the European sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me of these three,
let's say, topics or disciplines,
[SPEAKER_00]: which one do you think cannabis is going
to be the most has the most potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: shall we say, in Poland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there going to be large scale medical
cultivation sites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the manufacturing of edibles
and vapens and all that stuff happening
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as you guys are one of the best
partners of the parts of the world for
[SPEAKER_00]: designing software, do you see something
like you guys are doing or other companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming up as has been the kind of
the focal point of the Polish industry or
[SPEAKER_00]: the leader of the Polish industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for recognizing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, like, as you say, like Poland has
a huge history in horticulture and and
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural, horticultural practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're feeling that, you know,
the the kind of possibility of cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis in Poland can be a huge,
huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they are herders, as I
mentioned, you know, the research
[SPEAKER_01]: institutes that are supervised by the
Ministry of Agriculture that are allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: now to cultivate, you know, they have
challenges, obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they approach the approach was asked
to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to remember that we have a
pharmaceutical product that we're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are challenges of how to set up
those this this agriculture that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: into the pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are number that's number of
challenges that, you know, the law and the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation around how the kind of from
the commercial perspective, that
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation for those research institutes
will look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is no clear guidance of
how, you know, for example, JV with
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial commercial entities can work,
you know, who will fund those
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there is a huge capex,
you know, that is involved, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: huge investment in kind of building a
supply chain, you know, building,
[SPEAKER_01]: building a cultivation sites and then
production sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, before we go
into producing edibles, vapes,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, we need to kind of look into
how we're going to cultivate, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: good, well verified, you know,
credible pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first hurdle we need to
jump on in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's when it's when it's
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a huge history of working with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need to remember that up to
60s Poland was the biggest hemp producer
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe and the second in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had over 30,000 hectares of of
cannabis, you know, industrial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is there is a history of working
with that plant in Poland and being
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted within the kind of society to a
certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if it comes to software and this is
where we feel very comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have a huge, huge, great community
of IT specialists around machine learning,
[SPEAKER_01]: around blockchain, and that expertise
helps us in trust a lot to develop the
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you know, that can change and can
change completely the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we believe in here is to that
bringing that medical cannabis mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: lies in the creation of proof based
ecosystem where quality and compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: verification is streamlined and that's
streamlined and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing that traceability, auditable
traceability, immutable compliance,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those things that make product better
for the patients, they can come through
[SPEAKER_01]: the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't need to blindly trust
certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to blindly trust,
you know, what we see on documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can trust the technology and the
verification through technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that whole source and
everything that happens across the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain with cannabis can be checked and
verified.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, you know, that pedigree
of, you know, good, great, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: technical expertise from Poland,
it's playing a great benefit for a company
[SPEAKER_01]: like us, like Trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, it's the technical expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think everybody's looking at
the cannabis industry with a rose-tinted
[SPEAKER_00]: glasses, whereas the people who are
dominating certain sectors like motor or
[SPEAKER_00]: food and beverage are going to be able to
dominate when it's coming to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's about implementing the skill
set of each territory that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: suit the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Ireland is going to be one of
the homes of the European industry truly
[SPEAKER_00]: from a finance, a legal advice and
consultancy and company setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we're not going to be the biggest
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we're not going to be a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's about finding what it is
that each territory is specializing in and
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing that to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we spoke, you guys have three
specific global sectors that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: already excelling at as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see why these can't be brought
into a global cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we need to remember like why
we are based between Ireland and Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say Ireland may not be a greatest
cultivator, but you know, that connection
[SPEAKER_01]: to pharmaceutical industry here in
Ireland, you know, can help us a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of understand and bring certain
things from how the, how the medicine is
[SPEAKER_01]: verified, how it's produced to the certain
standard and how, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis, how we can secure supply
for patients, which is a huge problem in
[SPEAKER_01]: countries like Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, last year we had a
challenge, you know, in Poland where by
[SPEAKER_01]: four months there was no product at all in
the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of the challenges with the
consistency and the quality, there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: product for patients in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point, I think around October,
140 kilograms of cannabis were brought
[SPEAKER_01]: into Poland and they were bought up within
two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can imagine that, you know,
like that was bought up in two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens with the patient next month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that's challenges that we can
resolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that here, that connection
between Ireland, you know, where the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, we know a lot about pharmaceutical,
we know about a lot about supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a lot about how to bring good
product on the quality, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and using technologies that are used in
pharmaceutical, all food, like you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Poland with this expertise in
technology, in agriculture, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can combine those elements to bring
that better product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to remember Ireland is great
place, you know, it's greatly positioned
[SPEAKER_01]: strategically between, you know,
Europe and United States, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: two continents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's amazing kind of large part for us
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I couldn't agree much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ireland might be the slowest to
get our shit together when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting the industry going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think is when it comes to like
the drug development and discovery,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've already got the best pharmaceutical
companies already here in the country to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to fast track the potential orphan
drugs and real life drugs that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted after five or six years of
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that's one, you know,
and then obviously Poland, we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at Poland as our, let's say I'm Polish,
you know, and lots of our team are Polish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have here in Ireland, let's say sales
office, most of our production happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's great to have also the
scientific basis in Poland, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of agricultural scientists
working on new genotypes development,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, new marking of biological
markings of, for example, strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can deep into that, you know,
from one side in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge on the other side on the
agricultural knowledge, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: around the plant and plant expertise,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what Ireland and Poland are going
to be able to do in the European industry
[SPEAKER_00]: once time has enough length in front of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something you're looking forward
to over the next 12 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see being the little cherry on
the cake over the next 12 months for you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys at Trust?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with us at Trust, like we are in a
phase now of raising our next round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every startup, every ambitious
startup, we need funds to realize our
[SPEAKER_01]: mission and vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already launched our first version of a
product, which is being implemented in
[SPEAKER_01]: various sites in Poland and Spain and
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting those in quarter one,
2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be launching our commercial
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So launch of our commercial product at the
beginning of 2023 is our, if that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: launched well, if that's being
implemented, we have a lot of excitement
[SPEAKER_01]: around product while we talk to the
clients, to licensed producers who can
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize production, who can prove the
compliance of their products and then
[SPEAKER_01]: trace their product up to the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they know exactly what the patient is
taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can do that, if we can launch
successfully, that will be my cherry on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cake for the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our main objective within the
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think clear rules and regulations
and traceability and accountability is
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys are going to be able to
bring to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're all looking to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the governments can see that there's an
actual playbook that everybody's playing
[SPEAKER_00]: from and everybody has to play with the
same rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our time is up for now, Mike, but thank
you very much for taking the time to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for watching
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
