[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Uri Purnell, who's the CEO of NextGen
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe based in Belgium.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Uri?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, fine, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of your position in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and how long you've been in
the sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the sector since 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have different positions in Belgium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the CEO of NextGen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are market leader in the CBD of the
cannabis light industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As everybody knows, Belgium was one of the
first in 2019 to have a legal framework to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell CBD flowers as a tobacco substitute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with my background in the tobacco
business, I jumped on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we're market leader with between
50 and 60 percent market share in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regular Belgian market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next to that, we have our brands Pure
CBD, Pet CBD and our retail network Flora
[SPEAKER_01]: Point that you can see behind me,
where we have five shops and we distribute
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure CBD and different shops, pharmacists
and parapharmacists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my Belgium position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next to that, I'm a business partner
with Cure Support, Labocan, and there we
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver white label and private label CBD
products all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We deliver in 70 countries all over Europe
and the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: First topic I'm going to jump onto is an
overview of Belgium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe break down for everybody,
what are the exact regulations in Belgium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a thriving market for the flower
under 0.2 percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a big medical program?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the political outlook like in
Belgium?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a typical Belgium situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I think it's all very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, the flowers below 0.2 percent THC
can be sold as a tobacco substitute.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means from a bounded warehouse with a
tax stamp on it like cigarettes are sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next to that, we have CBD markets where
cosmetics are allowed like in any European
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD and oil is forbidden due to the
NOVA food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an amount of CBD oil is sold,
but not for intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sell it, but on the packaging,
you have to mention that it's not for
[SPEAKER_01]: intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the situation on CBD or
cannabinoid business.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see the business of THC flowers,
there's a lot of noise for the moment on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Belgian market like in the rest of
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Belgium is watching what's happening in
Germany, what's happening in Czech
[SPEAKER_01]: Republic, what's happening in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we see the political landscape today
and there has to be votes, it's in favor
[SPEAKER_01]: of the legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some politicians have to enter a low
proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's not the case for the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not be the case for the moment
because next year we have elections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody is looking at the elections.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see in the paper is that a lot of
political parties or other parties who
[SPEAKER_01]: were involved in this are giving their
opinion that we have to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, to decriminalization,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on a blueprint that we're
going to launch next month with the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Cannabis Summit in Belgium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to launch also our blueprint,
how we see it and a full closed system
[SPEAKER_01]: that has fully control of the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we believe that there's a market for
regularization of the THC business and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore we made a blueprint that we're
going to propose and launch in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the medical side of
the market, is there a thriving medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry or is it limited by the
amount of patients that can access it?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Belgium you can buy CBD as a major
stroll, but it's not a big market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to it, THC flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have medical THC flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, there's not such a thing as
medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same flower, it's all the
same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing it's cultivated differently
and more strict if it's medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Belgium, the pharmacists are not
selling flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not legal to sell flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC flowers are both 0.3% THC,
even medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't existing in Belgium,
on the Belgian market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the political
overview, is there one dominant party in
[SPEAKER_00]: Belgium or as you said with the elections
next year, is it going to be a coalition
[SPEAKER_00]: of parties?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how many of those parties are
pro cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, Belgium is a very,
there's almost three countries in one
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two countries in one country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The southern part, the French speaking
part is run by the socialists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in favor of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week also the minister did an
announcement that he wants to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis THC cannabis in Belgium.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Flemish part, we have the
socialists who are pro legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the liberals who are pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have NVA and Vlaams Blok who
are right and extreme right parties who
[SPEAKER_01]: are against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything will depend on the elections
next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's up to the commerce, to us to come
with a plan that nobody, the market is
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're obliged to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization, I don't like to use the word
legalization because in my eyes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in Belgium we have about six ton
of illegal sales by month.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do a conversation with the Dutch
market, I think Belgium, every month
[SPEAKER_01]: again, we have six ton of illegal THC
assault.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 80% of the sales is to non problematic
users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see why we cannot regulate this
market because now it's illegal and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: but nobody does something against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can focus on the 80% of the non
problematic users to bring them in a
[SPEAKER_01]: framework where they can buy controlled
THC with label tests, et cetera on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody's a winner in this
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see in Belgium that everybody's
kind of waiting for one of the European
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, whether it be Germany or the
Czech Republic or Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you mentioned, is everybody kind of
just keeping a step back and seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think they're actually very
driven to create their own policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: framework?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yes, you have to look and you
have to be aware what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, every country has its
own background and way of handling the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation and narcotics, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly believe that Belgium doesn't
have to look at what they didn't do with
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, the legalization with flowers to put
it as a tobacco substitute.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first country in Europe who did
it in 2019 followed by Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Luxembourg is going from 0.2 or 0.3
THC to 1% THC like the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Belgium is keeping 0.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't believe Belgium has to look,
they have to look, but they have to draw
[SPEAKER_01]: their own legal framework on the
regularization of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on now to the NextGen story,
you'd mentioned that you come from a
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco background and you saw the
opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys also successfully had some
investment in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mind maybe give everybody a quick
little run through of the story of NextGen
[SPEAKER_00]: from the start to where you guys are now
as one of the dominant players in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: So NextGen was founded in June 2019 due to
the legalization of the legal framework of
[SPEAKER_01]: selling CBD flowers or cannabis light
flowers are below 0.2% as a tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: substitute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work for Imperial Tobacco and
Gallagher in the tobacco industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know how to handle bounded
warehouses, tax stamps, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We jumped on this business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get supplied by this DLH.
[SPEAKER_01]: After three months, we took over also our
importer and we did only the distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three to six months later, we took over
DLH who was the importer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We deliver at all organized structured
clients as night shops, press shop,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 2000, 2500 shops that we
deliver our flowers to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to that, we launched Pure CBD as a
wellness brand where we sell to the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: stores and to the pharmacies and
parapharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small market that's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing a little by little and people
get more and more aware of the benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: using CBD or cannabinoids in their healthy
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took over also over one point of sales,
flora points.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, we have five of them
because that gives us access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer to have data and insights what we
don't have in this market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we want to create, we want to be
in pole position if legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: happening, if we can sell through point of
sales that we already have our network.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the main reasons of flora
points and to have a fully integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been sold, I've sold my shares to
always Pure Organics in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always Pure Organics was a Manchester
based company, white label, private label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to the Brexit, et cetera, they were
looking for a European food grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took us over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the deal didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story is that today APO is in
bankruptcy and I bought back the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took back the company in May,
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we restructured it and today the
company is on the one hand in the hands of
[SPEAKER_01]: myself and on the other hand in the hands
of Labocan and Pure Support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the majority shareholders of the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys look to be very well positioned
for the coming years for a lot of M&A
[SPEAKER_00]: activity that may happen across the brands
and the distribution and the retail side
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hopeful that we're going to see a
cannabis industry over the next five years
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what we saw in 2021 till the end of
21, a lot of M&A activities happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of crazy prices were paid for CBD
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're today in a normal situation
where M&A activities are happening with
[SPEAKER_01]: companies with a positive EBITDA,
with brands, with a vision, with a mission
[SPEAKER_01]: and not anymore on dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I believe that again,
there are two axes in this business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one is the smoking axe where I
believe tobacco companies can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting in jumping on this business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them already jumped in or are
closely looking at jumping into this
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other hand, we have the CBD
business who has 50 shades of gray in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wellness sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big pharmacy, big pharma companies are
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are wanting to take,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you say in English?
[SPEAKER_01]: Brevets on it or Octroys on it or et
cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see the business moving more
professional, more structured and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cowboys like I call them that we saw in
the early stage of this business are gone
[SPEAKER_01]: now and only the serious companies are
staying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see CBD cannabis as a standalone
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are seeing it as a part of the wellness
lifestyle brands, fast moving consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we treat, how our strategy
is based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're launching, we're having lifestyle
brands with our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems we brands are going to be
the winner of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing before I let you go,
when it comes to the actual main supplier
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the ingredient things,
there's been a lot of talk about using
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation engineering to be able to
produce these molecules in large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a scenario where Europe
actually is dominated by a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech companies that can do 5,000 liters
a day of a pure molecule and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: main ingredient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you always see a cultivated oil always
going to be available?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see that we receive from the
cosmetic and from the pharma because we
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver raw materials also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see more and more demand of
synthetic because there you have proven
[SPEAKER_01]: stability of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you don't have, if it's not coming
out of the lab and if it's from growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have the stability and in
cosmetics and in food, it's difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: working with a non-stable stabilized
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very much look forward to hearing you
speak at the Cannabis Summit in October in
[SPEAKER_00]: Leuven.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to know more about
NextGen Europe, the website is below and
