[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Andrew Bonello, who is the president at
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-Leave Malta.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's worked since 2019 tirelessly to
represent the voice of cannabis consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: in Malta and I'm delighted to have you on
the show today, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to touch on all things
Malta and try and explain to the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and the consumers out there what's going
on in your exact territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick overview of how you ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming the president of Re-Leave Malta
and we do that in under a minute?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I've been an activist for at
least the past 10 years, basically due to
[SPEAKER_01]: the draconian approach we've had locally
towards cannabis consumption and
[SPEAKER_01]: possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things were getting out of hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arrests were happening on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw some crazy prison sentences as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was time to step up and actually get
out and do something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a change in government in 2013,
where they seemed to be pretty interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in listening, which was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they kind of opened the door,
we barged in.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be a story that's
replicating itself around the world that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody thinks they've got their own
isolated case, whereas the laws were very
[SPEAKER_00]: draconian, very severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have stepped up to the plate like
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of activists in
Ireland doing the same thing to help
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth out the edges of the laws and if
not get a full adult use market going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of what are the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers in Malta in terms of
demographic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 70% male, 30% female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it mostly under 35 year olds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it over 60 year olds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the consumer look like in Malta?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, I mean, obviously,
it's hard to be precise, because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: have such a draconian zero tolerance type
setup and there's no way to know exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what the demographics are, because it's so
underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say this, that your typical
cannabis consumer in Malta is just a
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible person who usually has a job
and a family like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that they choose to use cannabis
over maybe some other legal types of
[SPEAKER_01]: substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and is there any figures calculated so
far on what is the size of the population
[SPEAKER_00]: that use cannabis in Malta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over in Ireland, it looks like it's in
around 10% of the population of Ireland
[SPEAKER_00]: will consume cannabis as a recreational
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well, our past parliamentary
secretary had come out and said that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were around the 40,000 mark, and that's
cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that we are a population of
450,000, maybe close pushing to 500,000
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'd say it's around 40,000,
but that's being very conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that things have moved forward,
obviously, we'll be able to collect more
[SPEAKER_01]: data, which is something we've been
pushing for, to be able to obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: implement sort of better policies to
update our policies as well, together with
[SPEAKER_01]: what the data we managed to collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and next topic I wanted to jump onto
is basically just an overview of Malta and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw that you had very draconian
laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you had an election.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a different viewpoint on medical
cannabis then.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically had laws where companies
could set up facilities to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: import product, rebrand it, repackage it
and ship it out to the likes of Germany's
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that currently exactly where the
industry is at in Malta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there any talk about an adult use
recreational market and the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tourism to take place in Malta?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, medical cannabis entered the scene
in around 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, the companies that were
attracted were sort of the bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: well-established, well-known companies
that came here to set up to, like you
[SPEAKER_01]: said, to import, basically rebrand and
export.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this started to happen before actual
local patients were able to access medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a bit of an overlap over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to be quite vocal about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Medicines Authority then had to
start letting some pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies here import to be able to
satisfy the local medical cannabis patient
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sort of came in after the cannabis
companies were established locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the moment, yes, there are over,
I think, between 50 and 20 companies here
[SPEAKER_01]: which, like you said, import from other
countries and repackage and outsource.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do finally have some cannabis on
the market which is from the local
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the prices obviously did drop a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then with the new law, which came out
at the end of last year, which was an
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment to our Narcotics Act where it's
entitled cannabis to be grown at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor plants are allowed to be grown at
home without fear of persecution or
[SPEAKER_01]: arrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once that sort of came into effect,
then the medical cannabis prices started
[SPEAKER_01]: to drop even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've gone down to sort of quite
affordable at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a system where your local GP
can prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, you have to get a control
card first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to be signed off by the
superintendent of public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the onus does then fall on the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the doctor has to take full
responsibility for what he is prescribing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the situation we are
at at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding recreational cannabis,
yes, we had in the last amendments which I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned and which came out in December,
2019, where we're going to be having an
[SPEAKER_01]: authority for the responsibilities of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been set up with the chairperson
and the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: This authority is still being finalized
and they're still trying to put their team
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been concluded yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's taken about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when all this happens, according to
law, basically we'll be allowed to have
[SPEAKER_01]: associations which will be allowed to have
up to 500 members and dispense to each
[SPEAKER_01]: member up to seven grams of cannabis a
day, up to 50 grams of cannabis a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there won't be any on-site
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there won't really be social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be so-called associations where
you will go in as a member, be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire cannabis and leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only legal place one can
consume is in their own house at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, we can walk around in
public with seven grams on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police can't do anything about that or
take it, which was quite a big win for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the inclusion of the expungement
of criminal records, which came into
[SPEAKER_01]: effect as well, which is something very
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still have to see how many people
have applied, how many people have been
[SPEAKER_01]: actually given, how many have had their
conduct expunged.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the homegrown rules seem to be in
the catalyst now for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously not social clubs because
they can't consume them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say membership clubs where a
consumer can purchase their own cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: grown by a much larger facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that expected to be announced very soon
or is that the ability to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: available right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability is not available because
they still have to they still have to
[SPEAKER_01]: issue the final guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously there are organizations
which are getting together and teaming up
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're ready to put their names
forward to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe one thing I left out is
important to mention is that this would be
[SPEAKER_01]: run as a nonprofit system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really going to be an industry
per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more going to be the community after
looking after its own community as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of the business coming in and
taking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is what they want to do
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the control,
cards for medical cannabis, as you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor is responsible for whatever
they prescribe and the amount they
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how hard is it to get a control card?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific model that everybody
has to follow the exact same rules or is
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start a Department of Health
or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What governmental body is it is it don't
run through over Malta?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the superintendent of public health
is basically the person that would sign
[SPEAKER_01]: off your control card at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you have to first of all
see your doctor and you have to prove to
[SPEAKER_01]: your doctor as well that you have been on
at least two medications that have not
[SPEAKER_01]: worked for you basically for your
ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you can prove that to the doctor,
then the doctor will apply for you to get
[SPEAKER_01]: your control card through the
superintendent of public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many have been rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I do know that people that
have had a past substance abuse problem
[SPEAKER_01]: who have entered the rehabilitation center
anytime in their lives will be rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, people that drive vehicles for a
living will be rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some rejections that could
take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think on the whole, when we look at
the way medical cannabis is dispensed
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout Europe, I think Malta is
probably one of the according to the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors is one of the the best the best in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you definitely seem to be one of the
model countries so far in the European
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch now about basically the
letters you guys sent to Ursula von der
[SPEAKER_00]: Leyen about the CBD flower seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a big thing in Ireland at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of core cases going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be that a thing that we
have all around Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on one side, you can understand police
and the guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand what CBD is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them, it looks like a duck and it
smells like a duck, cracks like a duck,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it must be a duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did those letters go that you sent
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And was there any reply back from her
office?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a reply and acknowledgement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the situation is this look,
I know you have the same situation in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland, but we actually had a law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our law was amended in 2019, like I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that law, it says that cannabis is
now going to be considered anything with
[SPEAKER_01]: zero point two percent THC upwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything below zero point two percent is
not considered cannabis in the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, it's being interpreted
by the prosecution in a different way,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because they're saying that it's
cannabis products, sort of CBD products
[SPEAKER_01]: are one thing, but CBD flower is another
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our letter basically to Wonderland was
trying to get some sort of harmonization
[SPEAKER_01]: going where we, you know, just 100
kilometers away from where I am sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: right now in Sicily, for example,
you can you can buy CBD flower from a
[SPEAKER_01]: vending machine and you can probably cross
borders with it without any problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in another European country like
ours, then you will get arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your house will be searched.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can they can block your
finances freely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using your finances and lock you up for up
to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually still happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having places raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shops are being raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individuals just buying CBD flower online
up to three or four grams are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested and raided as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of ongoing court cases at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to be a bit messy when it
comes to CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really would like to see some sort
of harmonization and something to be
[SPEAKER_01]: sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: As quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a lot of European entities
are hoping for the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing I wanted to touch on was
basically the 7th of September meeting in
[SPEAKER_00]: Prague that recently happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that there's a politician from
Malta that's part of a European coalition
[SPEAKER_00]: of different coalitions, sorry,
of different politicians looking to change
[SPEAKER_00]: the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell us about the action that
they're they're enacting at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it going to be of much use to the
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, what what happened over
there was obviously a very positive move.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something we had suggested as well
before or just after the law had come in
[SPEAKER_01]: that we need to get together with other
like minded countries and try and move
[SPEAKER_01]: forward together, especially us being such
a small sort of nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was what they did release a
letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they released a statement after
that meeting, which which was very
[SPEAKER_01]: positive as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do feel that we need other countries
to to to join to make it stronger so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually take it to the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And discuss it as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that way, hopefully, things can move
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, let's not forget that the
international conventions as well to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is more complex than one might sort
of think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just something that can be done
overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of countries that have to
agree if one country wants to legalise,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the other countries seem to have
to agree as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a bit convoluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so having these countries getting
together, even if it was just a few,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you said, in Luxembourg was was a
major first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully there's many more positive
steps to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a European wide industry
within the next number of years where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can all travel freely and sample the best
cultivars that Europe will have to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hope and let's hope that Malta will
have its own cultivars to when people will
[SPEAKER_01]: be coming here to taste ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's I think that's everybody's
game is that they have their own identity,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own cultivars and their own
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's no need for international
MSOs from North America to come over and
[SPEAKER_00]: set up here when there's already the
talent and the new instability already
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally agree, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're going to build something,
it's got to be built from the grassroots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's the consumers that know
what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they might not want the sort of
McDonald's type of cannabis to to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing to hit the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we're kind of really
interested and like the the setup of kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a social clubs where you can really get
socialized, you can get to meet your
[SPEAKER_01]: peers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, if anyone ever does develop
a problem, you know, you've got help and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can get educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things you can do within a
kind of a social club with the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look forward to see this spreading
around Europe faster than any sort of big
[SPEAKER_01]: business taking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to touch base over the
next 12 months and we can get an update on
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta and how everything is going for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, thank you very much for your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
