[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Spiros Malandrakis, who's the Head of
[SPEAKER_00]: Research of Alcoholic Drinks at
EuroMonitor International.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Spiros?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful day, great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining me,
a man with a wealth of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll be able to shed some light
on the cannabis drinks industry for the
[SPEAKER_00]: viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of how long you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: researching the alcoholic drink market and
your period at EuroMonitor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the lack of researching alcoholic
drinks for the last 17 years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily focusing on branding and kind of
my beautiful job is predicting what people
[SPEAKER_01]: will be drinking around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially all the great things from
the bars to the retailers in all
[SPEAKER_01]: categories from wine to spirits to RTDs
and everything in between like the
[SPEAKER_01]: categories like non-alcoholic other
beverages that have been making waves in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I've been covering the industry
for the last 17 years and has been
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely exciting and continues to be,
alcohol is an area that I'm continuing
[SPEAKER_01]: being very passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: About six or seven years ago, we started
realizing that there is a new kid in the
[SPEAKER_01]: block.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started realizing that the alcohol
industry is on the defensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a shift primarily when it
comes to millennial demographics and
[SPEAKER_01]: generation Z demographics moving away from
the alcohol consumption as we perceived it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the last couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're focusing more on pivoting or
shifting more towards moderation
[SPEAKER_01]: initiatives, health and wellness,
drive venues and non-alcoholic adult
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages, a category that a couple of
years ago would sound like an oxymoron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that stage, when I realized that
this is happening, regardless of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and anything cannabis related,
I also realized that that could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially be the point of cross
pollination between the two industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the alcohol industry is starting to
find alternatives to ethanol, basically
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients that can provide some kind of
high or some kind of social lubricant
[SPEAKER_01]: effects without necessarily incorporating
alcohol in the process, cannabis could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially provide exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of brings me to this
conversation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you believe are the biggest
challenges facing the cannabis beverage
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you see these evolving over the
next few years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, alcohol is doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been expanding for a number of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, but when it comes to volume and when
it comes primarily to the mature Western
[SPEAKER_01]: markets, as we perceive them like Western
Europe, North America, even increasingly
[SPEAKER_01]: other places like Latin America or even
Asia to an extent, I think it has starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to reach a point of saturation and extreme
maturity, especially when it comes to some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the major categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And exactly because of reaching that stage
over the last 10 to 20 years, the
[SPEAKER_01]: transition in alcohol has been primarily
towards what we call value creation or
[SPEAKER_01]: premiumization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since the category could not really
provide additional momentum in volume,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was focusing primarily on value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that also cannot be infinite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has its limitations, especially in an
era that we live right now, which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the greatest challenges when it comes
to microeconomics and the cost of living
[SPEAKER_01]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any alternative of expansion beyond
those realms that we have been exploring
[SPEAKER_01]: in alcohol for the last couple of hundreds
of years can provide amazing opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is what cannabis has the
potential to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got new products and new
legislation kind of evolving constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep on top of all the
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there certain sources of go-to or is
it a broad spectrum of a little bit from
[SPEAKER_00]: here, a little bit from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Euromonitor has analysts on about a
hundred markets around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have kind of boots on the ground,
providing some kind of unique perspectives
[SPEAKER_01]: on the latest when it comes to this
innovation, latest kind of trends on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I have the pleasure
of having some very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations with some of the biggest
companies out there, many of the smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: craft producers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an ongoing kind of evolving
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never really ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not supposed to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can start sometimes from a little
walk down the street in my local East
[SPEAKER_01]: London bar, all the way to a conversation
to the analyst on the ground in Shanghai
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me exactly what's happening over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is to kind of combine all this
information and make it into actionable
[SPEAKER_01]: trends or predictions about what the
future holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do you see as the key trends
that are going to shape the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage industry over the next few years
and how are they going to affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and the suppliers of these
drinks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a beautiful question,
but I think it can go in many different
[SPEAKER_01]: directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about cannabis beverages,
in practice, we speak about two,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, more than two, but essentially
with the key kind of two bastions of on
[SPEAKER_01]: one hand is the CBD side, which has been
making interest for a number of years now,
[SPEAKER_01]: much more ubiquitous than THC drinks,
obviously much easier when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislative frameworks to be allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have been making successes in
Europe and in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and North America in general and
increasingly in other places around the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, much easier to democratize
because the legislation is much more
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to allow them to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the other side, we have THC
beverages, which is much more niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do incorporate the psychoactive
substance in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally see them as having the most
potential to actually replace alcoholic
[SPEAKER_01]: drinks in the long term, not immediately
once the legislative frameworks allow them
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the kind of, if you wish,
the two main bastions.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, I see it as continuing to grow
potentially with a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: moderation on the initial kind of
stratospheric expansion, growth rates of
[SPEAKER_01]: the initial years, but definitely a lot of
a way forward as we move into CBD plus
[SPEAKER_01]: products, like not just contain CBD,
but also some minor cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: some adaptogens, in some cases,
some vitamins, energizing elements or
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the list will expand to
create this kind of added value CBD health
[SPEAKER_01]: and wellness position products.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, THC, unfortunately,
it's not really allowed in the vast
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of markets at the moment,
but we do see it very slowly starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: make inroads in markets like in the US or
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem it has been facing until now
for a number of years has been primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: on the back of the fact that what we call
the onset of the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of these formulations,
because THC and cannabis is not water
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble, but rather fat soluble,
were not made in a way that allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers to drink it and have an effect
within 15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases, it actually ended up having
an effect in about two or three hours
[SPEAKER_01]: after consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can imagine, if someone
consumes any kind of drink for the effect
[SPEAKER_01]: to then come in online in about two or
three hours, as they're about to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: car to go back home, that is not really
supportive of a social experience of any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with new techniques like
nanomalification and increasing new kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of technological advances when it comes to
that, many of these products actually do
[SPEAKER_01]: have an effect of the onset of the effect
within 15 to 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they start replicating the cycle of
consumption of alcoholic drinks,
[SPEAKER_01]: of a beer, of a spirit, of a cocktail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where it starts getting
much more interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saying that THC beverages are still only
accounting for very low single digits of
[SPEAKER_01]: overall cannabis consumption rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is really small at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think where we will start really
seeing them making massive advances in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future will be primarily when they start
appearing in on-trade, so cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: lounges, when we start seeing many more of
them appearing in dispensaries and when
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislative frameworks allow them to
actually make the impact that I know they
[SPEAKER_01]: can have in the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the challenges that are facing
the cannabis beverage industry is the
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage of CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you mentioned, emulsion technology
and the talk of cannabinoids sticking to
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminium cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see that problem being solved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a technology solution,
a biotech company creating a core
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient that actually is proven to have
efficacy in A, B and C that allows a
[SPEAKER_00]: Pernod Ricard or a Diageo to go,
okay, we're now going to make our own line
[SPEAKER_00]: of these beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more on the technical side rather
than the branding side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some kind of reliability when
it comes to mass production will
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely need to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know, all these companies,
all the major alcohol companies are not in
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't approach alcohol consumption or
production via this kind of pain cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: approach of vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really much vertical
integration alcohol drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol players know what they do well,
and that is logistics and branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they're focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, maturation as well,
but it's not that they necessarily the
[SPEAKER_01]: ABIs or Heineken's of the world will go
out having mass production of their own
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of hops or basic ingredients for
their drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take that from the outside,
but they need to have reliable partners to
[SPEAKER_01]: support them in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be one side of the market,
primarily the mass side of the market that
[SPEAKER_01]: will need these kind of reliable inputs
that will become an essential part of this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of production equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I think that we will
shift towards when it comes to the premium
[SPEAKER_01]: side of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the moment, they don't really
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll be more about specific
geographic identification initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect something like in the context
like Cognac or Champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis coming from specific areas or
regions around the world, be it the,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, the Golden Triangle in
California, Medocino County, places that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been intricately connected with the
wine industry, for example, historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will have this kind of added
value, even potentially luxury potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like Champagne, almost like Cognac.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would provide the inputs for the
higher end or more premium side of of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis drinks in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so but both the mass markets and the
premium or super premium sides both have
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not be the same, but I would
expect as the industry evolves and becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: much bigger, more and more diverse,
I think we will see very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: developments in innovation, technological
advancements and perceptions when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to different kinds of violence from
different areas around the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and so there's been the hype around
cannabis beverages has been pretty big,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the adoption rate has been pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned there that none of the
alcohol beverages are fully integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like with chocolate,
like with any large industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stick to your wheelhouse, you become
an expert in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that the branding is going to
end up becoming the biggest sale of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole platform?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the core ingredient is going to be
pretty irrelevant to most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it is with beer, as it is with a number
of alcohol beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody like the likes of guys like
Can and the guys over in America,
[SPEAKER_00]: they seem to have gotten the branding
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their target audience is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that the branding and the story
behind the beverage is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: paramount to the success of any company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two points on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've said in the past, many times and I
continue saying it in the alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol in general in alcohol offerings
are primarily marketing in a bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: branding in a bottle, so the value of
branding in many cases is actually higher
[SPEAKER_01]: or more important than the actual liquid
inside the can or inside the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can never really overstate the
importance of branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, unfortunately, within
cannabis has been this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: misunderstanding until now for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many companies that it was the idea that
you just stick some cannabis in a bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: and just going to sell itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're slowly moving away from that
era and people start realizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of positioning, demographic
targeting, occasion targeting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and obviously ultimately branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned Can, for our listeners
that are not familiar with Can,
[SPEAKER_01]: CA double N, one of the most iconic
cannabis, THC infused cannabis brands in
[SPEAKER_01]: the US at the moment, appearing in many
states and increasingly expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the support of a number of
Hollywood celebrities and Hollywood
[SPEAKER_01]: royalty from Gunez Paltrow to Rosario
Dawson, to many others that are
[SPEAKER_01]: increasingly coming into the fold,
supportive of LGBTQ issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much more open to these demographics of
generations that consumers that are always
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very interested in not just the
brand proposition, but what a brand is
[SPEAKER_01]: supportive of, what are the values of a
brand and then doing it exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would also, on top of that,
I would stress another kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiation factor as we are moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Can and products like Can are
increasingly creating this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: polarized approach when it comes to
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have on the one side products like
Can that have a very low THC content that
[SPEAKER_01]: allows for what we call kind of curious
consumers, consumers that are not very
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with cannabis, potentially in
some cases even intimidated by cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: drinks, allows them to try them because
they only contain two milligrams of THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: every can, essentially like a light beer
when it comes to alcohol, if we made this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of parallel.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, on the other side of
this kind of polarized approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have the very, very high dosage
cannabis beverages in the US, like
[SPEAKER_01]: Anklartnis, for example, have a hundred
micrograms in every bottle, which again,
[SPEAKER_01]: they obviously do not target anyone kind
of curious in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They target the cannabis connoisseurs,
people that have been consuming cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know exactly what they're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are looking for a very,
very high dosage, very high, high impact
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think both have potential moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the industry is evolving and it's
expanding, I think there is space in both
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, even the high dosage
products might be even more relevant in
[SPEAKER_01]: the short term because they are focusing
on an existing consumer base that is
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking of it in terms of how much higher
I get from my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the medium to longer term,
I'm much more excited about products like
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannes, low dosage, allowing for
sessionable evenings, essentially allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: people to have a couple of these Cannes
around a group of friends without the fear
[SPEAKER_01]: or intimidation that this kind of really
high, strong products can offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both cases, in high dosage products and
in low sessionable products, in both
[SPEAKER_01]: cases, I think branding, positioning,
occasions, demographics, graphic
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdowns, all of these things will
become increasingly more important as the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is slowly coming of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing before I let you go,
Europe obviously has a far more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: alcoholic beverage history than other
parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see once the legislation and the
regulations come in that the ability for
[SPEAKER_00]: European brands to dominate this sector is
going to be quite enhanced, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: American companies won't be able to keep
up with the technical know-how that the
[SPEAKER_00]: European companies have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think America already has too
much of a head start?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think America definitely has a head
start when it comes to the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would be very,
very difficult to compete against in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe simply because we are currently
running about a decade behind and
[SPEAKER_01]: considering the latest information about
the very slow, yet steady steps of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization when it comes to European
markets like the Czech Republic or Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: or the Netherlands, mostly still on an
experimental stage, not allowing a fully
[SPEAKER_01]: fledged kind of cannabis market or
research and development when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the American companies definitely
have a head start on that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, I think there is a
massive misconception for a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: investors and our American friends looking
towards Europe, thinking that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: literally just take any American brand and
superimpose it in European markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen that fallacy taking shape in
alcoholic drinks in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use the latest example of the
attempt to superimpose hard seltzers to
[SPEAKER_01]: European markets, a term that was not even
semantically translating in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, most European consumers
couldn't understand what they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they mostly flopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see a similar mistake about to
happen when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yes, the tech know-how is
there, the passion for the industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been doing for a number of
years, they understand scale, they
[SPEAKER_01]: understand logistics, but they need to
also understand that, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe is not one country it's many,
many countries that are very, very
[SPEAKER_01]: different between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, that they have to speak the
language of the consumers on each
[SPEAKER_01]: individual, even not just on a country
level, but on a regional or even on a
[SPEAKER_01]: city-based level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think managing to tailor this
offering, tailor the brand proposition
[SPEAKER_01]: according to exactly what the city
demographics in each of these markets is
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for will be the key to unlocking
the massive potential for the European
[SPEAKER_01]: markets in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely fantastic talking to
you, Spurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just run out of our time,
and I know you're a very busy man,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I won't keep much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank you very much for taking
your time, and hopefully we can get to
[SPEAKER_00]: chat again towards the end of the year and
see how advanced the European cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage market has gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, in a couple of years,
we can share a cannabis drink together as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very much look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Spurs, and thanks
everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
