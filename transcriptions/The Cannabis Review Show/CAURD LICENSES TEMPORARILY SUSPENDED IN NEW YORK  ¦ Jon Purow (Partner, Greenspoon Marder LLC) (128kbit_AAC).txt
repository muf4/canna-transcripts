[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, everybody, to the next episode of
the Campus Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
John Perot, who's a partner at Greenspoon
[SPEAKER_01]: Martyr LLC's in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenspoon Martyr LLP.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lawyers are precise about our words and
letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me do words good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I, and me don't want to do
math.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I ended up being a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, thanks for reaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're linking up right now
because of this momentous thing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of momentous, potentially
temporarily momentous thing that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: in the in the New York industry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the very, very quick snapshot,
right, is that, you know, New York
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized adult use marijuana over two
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then New York wanted to ramp up and
decriminalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a gap between when it is no
longer criminal and when an actual adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use market launches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that benefit the most
during that period are unlicensed illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York is very similar to
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was that, you know,
estimates in New York City alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,400 unlicensed stores popped open,
selling legitimate product from mature
[SPEAKER_00]: markets like California, where very
difficult, frankly, and the only people
[SPEAKER_00]: making money to some extent are people
selling stuff out the back door,
[SPEAKER_00]: high-end counterfeit products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just heard from a friend last night
that some of these stores are selling
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin chocolate bars in
child-appealing packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one big element that
happened in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, in order to,
you know, get sales started soon and also
[SPEAKER_00]: to help, you know, upstate, you know,
a lot of hemp farmers there who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt by the CBD market, they created this,
you know, conditional, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all these conditional programs
that I've opened up to to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate the process of starting sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of call them like the hemp
crossover licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're conditional cultivators and,
you know, processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to start making,
you know, there was a bill passed
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards creating conditional processors
and cultivators, you know, just in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, for, you know, a planting season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden there are,
you know, the seeds are going in for
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately will be, you know, what were
and, you know, was an estimated seven
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred million dollar harvest with
nowhere to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the conditional retail program was
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these programs, please keep in
mind, are unique to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing been done like this before
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any law has unintended consequences in
an incredibly complex industry like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, where all these pieces tie
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those unintended consequences increase
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this conditional adult use retail
dispensary program was created by the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, by the Office of Cannabis
Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to meet these very specific
criteria to qualify being someone with a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific type of marijuana conviction
showing that you were harmed by the war on
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs, but to ensure that you know what
you're doing when you're operating a
[SPEAKER_00]: business to also have had some history of
ownership in a profitable business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they get this program up and
running conditional retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say we're going to hand out one hundred
fifty licenses, one month to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine hundred people apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after it closes, the regulators
and I cover, I have a podcast we're about
[SPEAKER_00]: to relaunch where we cover everything in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen anybody do what New
York regulators did here in terms of after
[SPEAKER_00]: people had applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's said and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep on making changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for one thing, they double to three
hundred licenses they're going to hand
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's also this whole other idea of
we're going to have this fund,
[SPEAKER_00]: two hundred million dollars, fifty from
the state, fifty from a raise of
[SPEAKER_00]: investment, where we're going to allocate
one point five million dollars or two
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars to each of these car
conditional adult use retail dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: licensees that we hand out to for the
property in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to help you find the sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, something that
ambitious and a place as densely packed as
[SPEAKER_00]: New York that wasn't working and no money
was being raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after the application window
closed, some of the they decided they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use your own property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they realize that more people have
their own property in certain means than
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought, even though it might not
have been the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's seven hundred million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it farm to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People literally bet the farm to put seeds
in the ground and transition over from the
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling hemp and CBD market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a chance on the first row and
the New York cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be no place to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, you know, they after the
fact, O.C.M.
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hundred and fifty licenses we're
handing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use your own properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to double it to three hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to sell all that wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then recently they even increased it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a total of four hundred
and sixty three card licenses now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and they also after the
fact, they change and say, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want you to be able to sell like
immediately delivery out of the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: stores, whereas that had been intended as
a separate license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I think a separate license
on delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey, New York bounce around in my
head sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm on short rest from the fantastic
networking event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then but on site consumption
definitely intended to be a separate no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delivery was not a separate license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on site consumption was always
intended to be a separate license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, you know, they will
allow these cards to do on site
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they shifted, by the way,
in terms of like the intended race for
[SPEAKER_00]: full use for a card, what I was
referencing in terms of delivery was a
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of you could start sales ASAP out
of a temporary delivery location because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just trying to get, you know,
to address farm to get in and get weed out
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the way that I've actually described
all of this is in a way that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sympathetic to the
regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll say is I always do the
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I I thank them for their service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have great intentions of
coming in and helping people who can harm
[SPEAKER_00]: by the war of drugs, especially in states
like New Jersey and New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly can't please everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're dealt, you know, certain cards
by the law that they're handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this instance, you know,
the conditional processor and cultivator
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of portrayed all of this a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what inevitably happens in every
single state or lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those throw a wrench in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are losses you can predict
because, you know, in every single state,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, they the drug is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you blame local politicians and
regulators for trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the entire industry is going to be
inside their state, favoring people from
[SPEAKER_00]: the state versus what I call the kind of
carpet baggers, all pot puns always
[SPEAKER_00]: intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come up with things to favor
people in their state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this, you know,
dormant commerce clause issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like so incredibly frustrating
that the drug is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But according to this concept of the
dormant commerce clause, if regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with something that favors their
own residents, that detriments the people
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, since commerce is supposed to be
just, you know, like industry commerce is
[SPEAKER_00]: just supposed to be governed by,
you know, Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will knock out those wrecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a, you know, dormant commerce
clause has an almost 100 percent track
[SPEAKER_00]: record in multiple courts around the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lawsuit comes in like that,
holds up the awarding of licenses in
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was, you know, what's
different and is specific to New York and
[SPEAKER_00]: these moves that the regulators did in
creating the entire conditional adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: retail dispensary that was not in the
initial in the initial murder law that
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two lawsuits come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is a lawsuit nicely packaged
and intelligent package by some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest companies in the industry called
multistate operators who own the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses, the handful of medical licenses
in New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are vertical and they're the
only ones who could be vertical and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're treated separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of stuff in the initial
proposed laws that were not friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: towards any type of big business and
specifically these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing was saying you're not going
to be allowed to sell and cross over adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the car program, every single
lawyer, we all saw a vulnerability from
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said in the law itself, the
legalization law that the application
[SPEAKER_00]: period for all retail dispensaries had to
be open.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The card program created by, you know,
OCM, the regulators to address farmageddon
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything didn't do that at first
glance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, anyone could apply,
but they wouldn't have a shot because
[SPEAKER_00]: unless they have the scoring, the very,
very specific scoring criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, what ended up,
by the way, like I'm talking the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how my brain is piecing all this
together, because I've been thinking this
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the different angles and I want to
get to the nitty gritty of some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts in terms of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this lawsuit comes in and,
you know, and the interesting thing is the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuits in New York have accomplished
what they wanted to, to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawsuit by these big companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that happened
was the next version of the proposed
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations was released, you know,
by the regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, it had changes in terms
of accelerating the timeline for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to cross over adult use and a
couple of other things that were friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person who sued based on the
dormant commerce clause, because he was an
[SPEAKER_00]: out-of-state person trying to get one of
these card licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a settlement agreement with the
regulators in which the regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially promised to hand him a license
in the adult use round if he qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they settled just so they could remove
the injunction holding up the handing out
[SPEAKER_00]: of these licenses and opening up the
dispensaries in, well, at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one region left because they
hand out the card licenses according to
[SPEAKER_00]: regions tied to population to ensure that
there's sufficient supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last lawsuit that came out and the
one that's in everyone's mind right now is
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the initial murder legalization
bill, you know, there are specific classes
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that these bills are trying to
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about people hurt by the
war on drugs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you say like women owned
businesses and service disabled veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a group of veterans came along who
plunked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's been two years since the
bill was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plunked down money for real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking that things were going to get up
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made investment to be there on the
front lines and have one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries open and then card program
opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're suing along similar lines
as the coalition of the big companies
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing out that issue of the date.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all retail dispensary applications
open up the same date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pointed out some of these issues
in terms of how the regulators keep on
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially expanding the card program by
awarding more licenses, by letting them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do all these different things to
the detriment of all the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to participate in the full adult use
round, specifically the people that that
[SPEAKER_00]: round, you know, they want to hand 50% of
the licenses to these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain classes, including service
disabled veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a limited amount of
dispensaries that a state can support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's going to be 463 cards
handed out and operating presumably
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly before they get their chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they came in and, you know,
they said they asked for a preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: junction and temporary restraining order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is, is a party saying,
we are going to be, we're being so
[SPEAKER_00]: irreparably harmed right now that this is
untenable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need you judge to stop the other
party in this instance, OCM, we need you
[SPEAKER_00]: to freeze the card program in its tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just adding out, it's handing out
more licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not approving anybody who has a
license, but wants to become operational
[SPEAKER_00]: because all of these folks are scrambling
in one of the densest places that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are with location restrictions,
you know, tied to houses of worship and
[SPEAKER_00]: schools, you know, and certain localities
that have opted in or not to find
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are on the hook to pay
this property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, you know, they,
you know, the, the veterans, the
[SPEAKER_00]: plaintiffs asked for everything to be
frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the judge did here in this case
was, and this is the same judge who,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, appears as handling both the
coalition case, you know, and the veteran
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that at times, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's similar arguments,
similar issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what he did was he granted that
temporary restraining order.
[SPEAKER_00]: He froze the entire card program in its
tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a placeholder.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, you know, certainly
interesting that he did it, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this might just end up being a
placeholder until, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the, the current deadline for the
state to respond is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hearing is scheduled and this TRO
goes until the hearing on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not pushed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have an answer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on Friday, you know,
it's just a function of what will end up
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on, so on Friday, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there are two things, you know,
there are two things that could happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is, you know, he can deny the
request for a temporary restraining order,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which case card, you know, unfreezes
and keeps on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he grants the TRO, it would extend
through the point at which he makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision in the coalition case,
you know, in the coalition case,
[SPEAKER_00]: dueling summary judgment motions and the
coalition case, both sides are saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: they essentially have a winning hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the judge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the veteran plaintiff said,
all right, we want to freeze card until
[SPEAKER_00]: you judge this is what they actually asked
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you judge, make a call on the legality
of the entire card system in that other
[SPEAKER_00]: case with the coalition, where they made
similar arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the, the fear here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we all saw this vulnerability from a
ways out and it was so obvious is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, talking to other lawyers,
we all geek out about this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is, you know, an issue here
that, you know, it might not look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that the card program was
improper from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what I want to put up on
LinkedIn today and discuss is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, look, judges know what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disrupting the card program at this point
would be an incredible destabilization in
[SPEAKER_00]: a market that's already really,
really struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not, you know, an
administrative lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that people need to think of
lawyers like a thing of doctors who
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't ask a dermatologist to look at
something up your, you know what,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, having read some articles
around, including a point made by an
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney named David Holland or saying
like, you know, the only line of reasoning
[SPEAKER_00]: that could help the state is saying that
everything they did, the regulators was
[SPEAKER_00]: due to an emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I framed this entire narrative to
highlight two emergencies that were not of
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulator's own creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is unlicensed stores selling,
you know, products that are unsafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is the legislative legislature
legalized, created the conditional
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 700 million weed coming out
of the ground that needed someplace to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everything they've done in with the
card program has understandably really
[SPEAKER_00]: been for the purpose of safety of the
populace and selling the surplus weed so
[SPEAKER_00]: that these people aren't economically
devastated, upstate that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: intending to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing I'll say is like,
I want to dig deep into the chronology
[SPEAKER_00]: here because you're making this argument
that you're irreparably harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the thing that occurs to me is
why couldn't the plaintiffs have brought
[SPEAKER_00]: this earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: What just happened that changed this and
made this completely untenable and
[SPEAKER_00]: justified asking for a preliminary
injunction?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing that was relatively
recent was the increase from 300 to 463
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses being handed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm wondering if the judge can dig
them on that and then ultimately maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it doesn't look great because
they have strong arguments, maybe these
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency bases are enough that the
program continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible insights and it's very
well summarized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure everybody's going to get a wealth
of information like I just did out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've run over our time now, but hopefully
we can get to touch base in maybe a week
[SPEAKER_01]: or two and see where it all currently lies
then and do a part two to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me and
letting me speak the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time I'm going to interview you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
