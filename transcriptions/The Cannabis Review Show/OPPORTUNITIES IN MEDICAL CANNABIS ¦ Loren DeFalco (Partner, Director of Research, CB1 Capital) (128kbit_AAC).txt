[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by this episode
by Lauren De Falco who's a partner and
[SPEAKER_00]: director of research at CB1 Capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today Lauren?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, how are you Oli?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're very busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody,
I think we'll start off with your story
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got a pretty interesting
story in your background with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell everybody how you came to be in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so yeah I mean the last 25 years in
finance and it's about 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of back from a trip from the
home office at HSBC at the time and ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up waking up in an ambulance as I was
waiting for a car to pick me up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: airport back in Long Island and basically
was told that I had a massive seizure and
[SPEAKER_01]: my neurologist who I went to go see after
that told me that I had to start taking
[SPEAKER_01]: these medications or I would no longer be
allowed to drive so I started to take them
[SPEAKER_01]: and ended up stacking myself up on a host
of other meds to deal with the side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of the seizure meds and it was
just a decline in cognitive abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew this was not a good long-term
solution for the seizure disorder so I
[SPEAKER_01]: started to look around and found this work
being done overseas in Israel,
[SPEAKER_01]: Italy, and Spain and other countries on
the endocannabinoid system and I took a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the data especially in regards to
diet and applied it to myself copious
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of cannabinoids and a year later I
had another EEG with my neurologist and
[SPEAKER_01]: she said there was no more seizure
activity and a light bulb kind of went off
[SPEAKER_01]: like wow this actually works and you know
from that point on I strove to find out as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as I could about what this
endocannabinoid system was and the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay incredible, can you maybe explain to
everybody what CB Capital, CB1 Capital is
[SPEAKER_00]: and what your exact tactics in this
industry are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure so yeah we're a long short hedge fund
we also have a sister arm that is advisory
[SPEAKER_01]: for a whole bunch of private and public
companies but focused on cannabinoids you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the name CB1 is the first cannabinoid
receptor that was discovered in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mid-90s and so the idea with GW
Pharmaceuticals as the first successful
[SPEAKER_01]: ideation of this with their Epidiolex was
to find companies going through drug
[SPEAKER_01]: development through the FDA or EMA and
targeting the endocannabinoid system as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as other parts of receptors in the
body that cannabinoids seem to bind to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay very good, next topic I wanted to
jump on to is opportunities in medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the industry at the moment,
we obviously know Canada and America have
[SPEAKER_00]: got a head start when it comes to their
cultivation and the recreational side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry whereas Europe seems to have
laid out a more medical focused industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think Europe is going to have an
advantage when it comes to the creation of
[SPEAKER_00]: these new drugs and targeting receptors
and the creation of a pharmaceutical grade
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I'm not sure if they're going to
have an advantage as much as it just opens
[SPEAKER_01]: up more opportunities for investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the US has a hybrid model in a
sense that the state programs are medical,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all different in every state and
then there's drug development through the
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA such as GW Pharmaceuticals with
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know two distinct markets in the
near term the medical program especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe should start to really grow and
the longer tail because of the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time involved is the drug development and
that's what we foresee being the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: market as time goes on but it will take
time to get these drugs into the clinic
[SPEAKER_01]: and through an approval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the ingredient side
of this industry do you think the
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnology companies that are using
fermentation engineering and bioprocessing
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to deliver these molecules on
scale that might only be available at a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute percentage when it comes to the
actual plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they're the future of the
medical side of the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes we believe that anything that's
cheaper more consistent and the purity
[SPEAKER_01]: levels that you'll get relative to organic
farming you know lends to the idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: those especially for the minor
cannabinoids should be the preferred
[SPEAKER_01]: vehicle for research you know retail
opportunities as well consistent supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain the purity is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on how successful the scaling
up of some of these miners which we've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen some companies not execute on there
are a couple left that have we believe and
[SPEAKER_01]: so if they're successful with some of
these miners that should be the go-to for
[SPEAKER_01]: many purposes due to the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what makes a good investment
opportunity for you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are are there a couple of key
principles the management team potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for IP we can do like Danaher Systems do
where we come in and we can implement our
[SPEAKER_00]: business methods onto this company and
increase the value of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific strategy or is there a
no one size fits all for this industry at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean ideally like you know
management is always key to understand who
[SPEAKER_01]: the operators are to drive the vision
forward but there's I would say looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moat of the operators is very
important understanding their advantages
[SPEAKER_01]: there from an IP perspective or anything
else those are key differentiators.
[SPEAKER_01]: The size of the available market are you
are you actually solving a problem that
[SPEAKER_01]: exists or are you just trying to duplicate
something some other process out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally looking at management
understanding the moat looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity those are all very key factors
but especially in a startup it always
[SPEAKER_01]: comes back to the management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to making investments for
you guys being a data gatherer of sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: and understanding the nuances of policy
around the world would be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous thing to spot the best
opportunities coming for you guys would
[SPEAKER_00]: that be correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes very very focused on the regulatory
change that's happening in various
[SPEAKER_01]: geographical regions that does present
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: has been stymied with you know federal
changes that have not occurred for years
[SPEAKER_01]: now and how that you know will drive the
industry is a key factor into how we look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the investing opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at that looking at journals
they you know for the drug development
[SPEAKER_01]: side there's been some new cannabinoid a
couple of cannabinoid focused journals
[SPEAKER_01]: that are doing a lot of the you know
showing a lot of the pre-clinical work
[SPEAKER_01]: being done that will help to guide drug
development in terms of the right avenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah research is always key looking
there's a ton of information out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's increasing the amount of information
that's being driven through the you know
[SPEAKER_01]: research being done through pre-clinical
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the real value is in the
pharma companies or the biotech companies
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to get access to these
molecules and then blend them and mix them
[SPEAKER_00]: together to create their own formulations
for a various type of different ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the big money shot when it comes
to this side of the industry and if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to the IP side of things do
you think it's most advantageous to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the IP as quickly as you can or to keep
the process that you've created to
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself for as long as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the most advantageous route?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so trade secrets versus patents you
know it really depends and you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about retail type
operations sometimes those trade secrets
[SPEAKER_01]: are better kept but if you're looking at
drug development then you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a patent behind the products you're
bringing to market unless you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: through an orphan indication or something
of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah IP on cannabinoids the combination
for different indications combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids we believe that is you know
where things are headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difficulty once you get beyond a
couple different API you know there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: botanical route that you can go through
with the FDA as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do believe that once they understand
what's really driving the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_01]: as they say for therapeutic benefit we can
identify the specific compounds and the
[SPEAKER_01]: specific mechanisms and mechanism of
action that by isolating those compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: and putting them together that should be
the path forward for a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: countries for drug development but there's
also enzyme inhibition and catabolization
[SPEAKER_01]: that other companies have looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jazz Pharmaceuticals has a pha inhibitor
for PTSD that reads a phase two out late
[SPEAKER_01]: fall early winter this year and that is
not a cannabinoid it's a enzyme inhibitor
[SPEAKER_01]: but it targets endocannabinoids within the
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely different ways of targeting
the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a Nobel an artist the other day
purchase a Canadian cannabinoid focused
[SPEAKER_01]: drug development company for about a
billion dollars as they're going into a
[SPEAKER_01]: phase two for obesity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting it's early early
innings I'll say and the development
[SPEAKER_01]: should keep ratcheting up higher as more
research is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last topic I want to talk to before I
let you go is endocannabinoid targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
what are the steps that are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved for a company to create an
endocannabinoid targeted drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it product development, orphan drug
trial, clinical trial or are there
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple steps in between?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I mean you have to identify the
target the indication with the compound as
[SPEAKER_01]: well through various processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've identified the right compound
and indication you have to go through all
[SPEAKER_01]: the pre-clinical work unless you're going
to use a compound that's already gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through that for the 515B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know pre-clinical work,
animal studies, IND, entering the clinic
[SPEAKER_01]: is the normal process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically how most of these work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the US industry how
likely are we to see federal legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next 12 months or is this just an
ongoing point of annoyance for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization will take probably years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other steps along the way
there's the banking bill the safe act as
[SPEAKER_01]: they call it which is supposed to come
back up for committee September of this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also rescheduling that's in motion
behind the scenes and the timing of that
[SPEAKER_01]: rescheduling is hard to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some point between the end of this year
and the end of next year is the assumption
[SPEAKER_01]: that people have and if we get a
rescheduling down to a schedule three or
[SPEAKER_01]: lower it allows an opportunity for retail
loses their 280e tax penalty in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: For drug development you know there's not
too much difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bill that was put forth I
think last fall that tried to or some
[SPEAKER_01]: people thought was going to open up the
pathway for cannabinoid drug development
[SPEAKER_01]: not so much but you know if you could do
your pre-clinical work and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward with IND you'll be able to
work with these compounds in that setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man so I'm not
going to keep you any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely fantastic talking to
you Lauren.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to learn more about
CB1 Capital you can see the website below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be in all the descriptions where
you're watching or listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lauren for now thank you very much for
taking your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till next episode everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you
