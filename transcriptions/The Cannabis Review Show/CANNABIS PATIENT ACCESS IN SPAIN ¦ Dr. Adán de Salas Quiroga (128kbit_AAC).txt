[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, everybody, to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Dr. Adan de Salas Quiroga.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Owen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything fine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you graduated in biology,
specializing in neurobiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of how you got into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and what you're a specialist in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I studied biology and I specialize in
neurobiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point I joined the lab of
Manuel Guzman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big figure in the cannabis research
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I carried out a PhD mainly focused on
the roles governed by the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system in the process of brain
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I studied the proliferation of stem
cells, neural specification, newborn
[SPEAKER_00]: neuron migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these processes are tightly
controlled by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: and the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, interestingly, a big lab with
different lines of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a background also in cancer
research, neurodegenerative diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: and another potential therapeutic
possibilities of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping you're the man to be able
to give everybody the information that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the topic of this episode is patient
access in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a
breakthrough of the legal framework that
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed to have been passed over the last
couple of weeks, the timeline of patients
[SPEAKER_01]: getting access, and the reality of the
timeline, shall we say?
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that it's a certain amount
of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, I would like to give a
glimpse of the actual context,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of people actually believe
that we have legal access to cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people have heard about the
cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not actually anything legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that the users and
everybody found, let's say, the gray areas
[SPEAKER_00]: in the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all this for the recreational
users, but most importantly, for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: users, they have to go to the black market
or these clubs, which is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are subjected to a possible
fine or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it took place and actually it was
June 27, it was finally approved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: health commission within the Spanish
parliament, a text that integrates the
[SPEAKER_00]: summary or the main conclusions of a
subcommission that was taking place for
[SPEAKER_00]: the past months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this subcommission gathered
experts, physicians, people from
[SPEAKER_00]: associations and many different voices and
to evaluate, to study the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, medical cannabis regulation in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, this was finally approved for
with 20 votes in favor, 14 against and two
[SPEAKER_00]: abstentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this text kind of set not rules,
but suggestions on the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, there are many questions
for, for instance, what, so we can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers sadly are not included in this
text.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are only stated for experimental
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it is included, so the,
what patients could have access to are
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized products or preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what it is very interesting is
this called a master preparation,
[SPEAKER_00]: master formulas, I believe is called in
English and is something that allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: tailor made a medicine because the
physician taking care of this patient
[SPEAKER_00]: could actually change the, the,
in case a patient has troubles to swallow
[SPEAKER_00]: or has any other medication that could
interact with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Components or to actually read at just
the, the rate of cannabinoids to allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: individualized or very personalized
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what is controlled and who
could be prescribing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not clear in the text.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they say a should be done by a
specialist physicians and this depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on how eventually the regulation adopts
this point, it could be open to the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary care physicians and private
institutions, or only for pain or a
[SPEAKER_00]: neurologist or this kind of specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the patients could get access to these
products in pharmacies in regular,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say common pharmacies in the
neighborhood, but also within the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals and the pathologies that are
actually so far included because this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: prospective, let's say text, no,
but so far the indications accepted are
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sclerosis that we had already
Sativex, which was accepted already in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain to treat this spasticity associated
with a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we have certain types of epilepsy and
nausea and vomiting derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy, endometriosis, and also
oncologic and non-oncologic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are mainly the, the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, in the text,
there are many other aspects such as the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the they indicate to the responsible
agency, some points in the, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, how they should ensure access
to these products and how they should
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure the education of the medical
professionals and et cetera.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very in depth analysis of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the framework, just to maybe give
everybody a rough little breakdown,
[SPEAKER_01]: it says that there's neuropathic pain and
chronic pain allowed in that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensing of the product, but it might be
only by specialist doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would this be a specific brain
specialist or as a post chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor specialist, or is that still open
to interpretation yet in the finalized
[SPEAKER_01]: rules?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still open to interpretation because
they say that what they say is the
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals allowed are physicians
without conflict of interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say, they say preferentially
should be done by a specialist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this we don't know as, so this is an
initial, let's say proposal, then what
[SPEAKER_00]: will be eventually implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: This we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that I forgot to mention
is that the, in this text, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they give a frame, a time work,
a time frame, sorry, of six months to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement all these measures to the
responsible agency, which we believe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really very, I mean, being realistic is
not going to be in this, in this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but well, let's, and so we steal from the
activists, the associations, the certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis institutions, such as the Spanish
observatory of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to keep doing some pressure to
trying to ensure that the final adoption
[SPEAKER_00]: of this text is as, as more complex,
I'm sorry, complete as possible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if the one nook in the cranny from
an outside perspective, looking in that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not determined who the doctors
are yet, but who gets the license to
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what text is going to be in that
license?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's specific, it specifies a
specific type of doctor, then I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: market will have a little bit of a
shortfall when it comes to patient access.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the general practitioner,
if it's going to be neuropathic pain and
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain, a general practitioner
should be able to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as he said, getting a licensing system
built in six months stretch for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a big, big difference
because I mean, just talking about pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: no chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the numbers estimated are one in
six patients in Spain are suffering from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about 8 million people in Spain
and let's, let's be cautious and assume
[SPEAKER_00]: that only one third of the patients are
really sensitive to cannabinoid treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, I mean, really low number
because we could assume more, but let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say one third, this is more than 2.5
million people that could already benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: and change their lives with this
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this is not going to take
place if only a specialist and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we need to, we need to change
the healthcare professional's mind because
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them have no clue about the
physiological basis of the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they barely heard about the
endocannabinoid system and the controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and even less they, they have no clue
about the actual clinical data with the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they don't have a specific
training, which is something fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: because cannabinoids are very particular
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot establish the dose effect
relationships that you usually do with
[SPEAKER_00]: another other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another challenge in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that kind of leads me right onto the
next thing I want to talk about was
[SPEAKER_01]: training the doctors and nurses because as
we know that this is going to get to a
[SPEAKER_01]: stage where, as he said, it's blends and
formulations of different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to be relative to each
individual patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be, there is a
prescription, everybody one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where is the training for the doctors
and the nurses going to come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to come from governmental
programs where they have experts like
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and Professor Guzman,
or is it going to be investment outside
[SPEAKER_01]: capital that comes in?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no specific mention in the
text.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they say is they encourage the
Spanish agent responsible agency,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, well, it doesn't matter the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They encourage to, to ensure the medical
educations of the, of the healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: profession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to my opinion, there are perhaps four
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, one would be private initiatives,
initiatives for like private platforms,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are already offering courses of
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course we could have university
linked programs, either master degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: either post graduate, programs,
something which is called a continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: training or continuous education,
which is somehow related to university,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's another type of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the government could
implement some programs associated either
[SPEAKER_00]: to hospitals, universities, or other type
of institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but then there is another,
and last way of training these healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals, which is taking actually
place in other countries as, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: this that I already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that the, the, the main companies
that got these licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they got the interest
because, you know, they have a big niche
[SPEAKER_00]: of market and they, they want these
physicians to, to be as, as educated as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could actually prescribe their
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so brands are actually investing a lot
of money into this training programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, to my opinion, these are the main
four ways that we could, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know which.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's going to be an interest in six
months over.
[SPEAKER_01]: To see how everything falls into place for
you guys up in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have our fingers crossed over here
in Ireland, that you get an industry up
[SPEAKER_01]: and running that leads the way for
compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an amazing challenge.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And helps a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is something we are pain
cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, this is something we need to act
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, as you said, there's at least a
couple of million people in Spain who
[SPEAKER_01]: could be benefiting from access to medical
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis products at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope everything goes amazing for you
over the next six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can touch base at the end
of the year or start of 2023 and we'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: an update and see where Spain is at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, thank you very much for Dan
and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ciao.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
