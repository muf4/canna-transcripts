[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking all things
investing, both US, Canadian and European
[SPEAKER_00]: on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm delighted to be joined this
episode by one of the top influencers on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media and Twitter and retail
investing at the moment, Roger A.K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff Daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, Roger, you well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well here in Canada and enjoying
the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, we're out of the snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, things are getting looking up in
Canada here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy to join you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been following you on Twitter and
going through some of the Reddit guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys seem to be one of the top sources
of information when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry outside of the media
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, what better than to get you
on and kind of help educate everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: while we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to maybe jump straight into
the first topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could give everybody a little
overview of what's an American MSO versus
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian MSO and why are and why would you
take a position on one or the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start with Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically where I started my
investing in the cannabis space back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, we announced in 2017 that
cannabis was going to be legal in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: and a huge, huge opportunity for
investing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had companies such as Canopy Growth,
Aurora Cannabis, Hexo, Teagod,
[SPEAKER_01]: Afria, Tilray, all large Canadian names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was quite a bit of excitement
going into legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, the big thing that was driving
stock prices, especially in the Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: space, was licensing and build outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seemed like every time that Canopy
or Aurora or Tilray announced an
[SPEAKER_01]: acquisition or expansion of their
cultivation or a new million square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation center, the stock prices
seemed to really, really take notice and
[SPEAKER_01]: jump up in price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, what happened when the day
actually of recreation happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: there weren't enough retailers out in the
space to actually sell the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had an abundance of plant and flower
to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the market, because we had not enough
retail, especially in our larger provinces
[SPEAKER_01]: such as Quebec and Ontario, made things
really, really tough initially on the
[SPEAKER_01]: large Canadian LPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ever since then, they've been
struggling to get that supply demand
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium at a right point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen a lot of closures now with
Canadian LPs with the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation that we had, just too much
supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: The demand is there, but the amount of
supply that we had in Canada, so back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018, the US name started popping up on
stock exchanges like the CSC and the OTC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously, it was the beginning
stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some states that were
recreational, such as California,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, that had huge markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's lots of opportunities in the
medical space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain states had medical programs,
some states had medical and recreation
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I thought it was a good
time to transition from the Canadian names
[SPEAKER_01]: to the US names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I really started to change
my focus to US MSOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems interesting from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems with Canada that the way to move
your stock price is basically growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: that if there's no consumers to buy your
product, then it's acquisitions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities or growth of facilities,
where I think America seems to be complete
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite, where there's a huge consumer
base ready there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's about getting the product
to those consumers as opposed to the flip
[SPEAKER_00]: side with Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Canada was a different bird in the
fact that basically you had all these
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses and cultivation licenses awarded
before the program started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you had this massive buildup of,
like I say, cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you didn't even really know what your
market was going to be in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, the Canadian LPs were
being handsomely rewarded with straight up
[SPEAKER_01]: arrow stock price moves of like 20%,
30% a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was the golden age of
cannabis where an announcement of an M&A
[SPEAKER_01]: deal between two companies for $3 billion,
companies like Canopy would go up like
[SPEAKER_01]: 30%, 40% in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seemed to really, really be the
talk of the town back in 2017,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the US, it's a lot different because
it's a lot more restrictive, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to medical licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's typically limited amount of retail
licenses awarded, typically limited amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivation licenses awarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of keeps in check the amount of
retail and the amount of cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically that helps keep keeping
prices pricing a bit stronger,
[SPEAKER_01]: longer term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, eventually supply will catch up to
that demand and you will see a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: compression on pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's the opportunity for some
of these medical markets to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational and then you're opening it up
to a whole new consumer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very complex still in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously we've seen the last 14,
15 months, some price compression in the
[SPEAKER_01]: US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's mainly due or a lot of
us feel that a lot of that's coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: the lack of federal legislation or help by
the federal government, especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: Democrats to get anything done to to move,
move the industry along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you tell me is the big thing between
them, the access to capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think is that the safe bank connect
is the hindrance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the next topics I want to
talk about with the M&A activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been kind of wondering,
is the access to capital in Canada going
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow for those companies to do mergers
and acquisitions in the US space and take
[SPEAKER_00]: their footprint via that model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think the likes of New York
legalize it now with everything on sale
[SPEAKER_00]: from September, the capital markets are
generally in New York and you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: access to capital if you're a company
based on that territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when it comes to safe banking and
access to capital, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got almost two different,
two different things going on in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your top MSOs, we call them tier
ones, your top say five MSOs from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cura Leaf, Green Thumb, True Leaf,
Cresco Labs, Verano.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even add another company or two in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically those companies,
their access to capital, they seem to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, able to to raise money through
debt or if they wanted to do shares.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, because the share
prices have been compressed, a lot of them
[SPEAKER_01]: have issued debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're getting rates around eight
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If if safe banking was was available,
chances are the rates would have been a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could have been, you know, four or five
percent at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those companies aren't struggling for
capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think where you're seeing the big issue
is when you start talking about social
[SPEAKER_01]: equity, licensing and smaller business,
when they don't have access to loans from
[SPEAKER_01]: banks to, you know, start a dispensary or
open up a store, it makes things really
[SPEAKER_01]: tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if they do have access,
the rates that they're paying are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more than the top tier US MSOs at eight
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen I've seen companies that have
been getting like 25 percent, 30 percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is almost loan shark pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and that's and that's if you can even
access that type of capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, there is a bit of a divergence,
but I mean, still being listed on the OTC
[SPEAKER_01]: and CSE as given the publicly traded MSOs
access to capital that's allowed them to
[SPEAKER_01]: expand quite a bit over the last two,
three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic I wanted to talk to you about
is your market position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you looked at it all in terms of the
European sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you probably know about Germany
legalizing over here, or is it still a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years away for retail investors
like yourself to be taking positions in
[SPEAKER_00]: European companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, obviously, with the announcement in
Germany that opened a lot of eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have looked into the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not saying that getting in a position now,
depending on your your timeline,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're looking two to five years
down the line, getting getting starting a
[SPEAKER_01]: position now certainly might be prudent
considering, like you say, the Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, because I think as Germany
goes, you'll see other just like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: US, you'll see, you know, gradually you'll
see different states and in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to see different countries
follow probably Germany, Israel going
[SPEAKER_01]: forward, expanding those those markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that some of these American
MSOs are going to have their way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you guys forecast with growth in
Europe into your investment or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys strategically focused on,
look, if we make X return across full
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and federalization in
America, that's enough for our position to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything after that is going to be a
bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, right now, I think that for
me, anyways, or my investment thesis is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the US market is still, you know,
in its infancy and has a long ways to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, we're talking like
Rhode Island just announced they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: 19th state to go recreational in the in
the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be large
opportunities and places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Florida to go recreational,
you know, two, three years down the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania could be fairly close in the
next year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me right now, my focus is still on
the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some Canadian LPs and also
companies like CureLeaf that have some
[SPEAKER_01]: European assets and are starting to expand
or focus a little bit more on Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think right now, because the market
still, you know, the announcement with
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, I'm not exactly sure 100 percent
how quickly that's going to take place and
[SPEAKER_01]: then what kind of rules and regulations
they're going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came back the other day saying
that the new Minister for Health is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to rush it through this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back last week saying that he's
going to try and push this through and
[SPEAKER_00]: have something ready for the start of
2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be and that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to when it comes to something like
that, the amount of time it takes to build
[SPEAKER_01]: a cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, like you have to
get all your ducks in a row when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to environmental reviews and permitting
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, once you finally
get your facility built, it could take
[SPEAKER_01]: three to six months before you'll have
enough, you know, a product that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: sell to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's existing facilities
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it happens like that, eventually
the businesses will catch up, but it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: take some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of capital that's going to be
required to build those facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's lots of money
available, whether it's private companies
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the opportunity forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you say, the quicker, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's some of the problem we see with
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: market is that politicians don't do what's
best for the constituents that they that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're leaders for and sometimes delay
things and and and it ends up just making
[SPEAKER_01]: it very cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like New Jersey had probably four to five
month delay when they were supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: start wrecking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that had an impact on a lot of
companies that had ramped up production
[SPEAKER_01]: with the expectation of of sales,
probably, you know, January, February
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it ended up being, you know,
maybe before they got the got to open some
[SPEAKER_01]: stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, it's an exciting time for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's there's a long way to go,
especially, like you say, Europe's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, you know, the dominoes will fall
just like in in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to individual states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, well, I think you and I both see
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a couple of dominant
brands at about 10 years time that will
[SPEAKER_00]: have merged and acquired pretty much
everything out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's whether you've got your dollars
behind the Coca-Cola of this industry or
[SPEAKER_00]: the McDonald's or whatever the large scale
operators may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an interesting ride to
see who that ends up being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you say, the brands and companies
like I think the news in Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely opened some eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't be surprised if you do see
maybe a few American companies start to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus a little bit more what's going on on
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is an abundance of
opportunities still in the in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: early stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Europe could be a huge
opportunity and obviously a country the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of Germany going going recreational
probably really start kickstarting the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Europe, so yeah, I look forward to
it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just come up to our time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you very much for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who isn't following Puff Daddy
Junior on Twitter, I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a great large Reddit group
that talk about US MSOs and Canadian MSOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, another great source of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your time today,
mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chat to you next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
You.
