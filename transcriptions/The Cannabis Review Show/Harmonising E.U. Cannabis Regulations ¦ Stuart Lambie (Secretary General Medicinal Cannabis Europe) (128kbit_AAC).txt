[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everybody, to another episode of
the Cannabis View.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this show
by Stuart Lambie, who's the Secretary
[SPEAKER_00]: General of Medicinal Cannabis Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, Stuart, you well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks Owen, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on the show now,
covering a topic that I'm sure most people
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about, but very few people have an
inside knowledge like you'll have on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, I just want to let
everybody, if you want to inform
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, how you're in the cannabis
industry in Europe and how you got to this
[SPEAKER_00]: stage now in a quick brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, Medicinal Cannabis Europe was
started up about three years ago as a pro
[SPEAKER_01]: bono project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just over a year ago, we established
the association as a non-profit
[SPEAKER_01]: association in Belgium under Belgian law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think unlike a lot of associations,
we're a multi-stakeholder association.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we welcome members from the patient and
medical community right through to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, our objectives are to
advocate for harmonized European
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation on medicinal cannabis,
create a level playing field for the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry to operate across all European
countries, push for funding for research
[SPEAKER_01]: and development funding from European
funds for investigation into medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last but not least, try to educate the
public stakeholders, the medical community
[SPEAKER_01]: about the benefits of medicinal cannabis
and try and get rid of the stigma,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in some places still attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us any fresh news that you've
heard coming out of Europe in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: councils being formed or something you can
inform the audience about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a couple of things
to pick up on very recent developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working for quite some time
now, about six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Together with various members of the
European Parliament and trying to be part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the process of bringing together an
interest group in the medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the good news on that front is that
there is now an interest group formed
[SPEAKER_01]: within the European Parliament of several
members of the Parliament from different
[SPEAKER_01]: political directions, different
geographies around Europe and an interest
[SPEAKER_01]: group in the European Parliament.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of your audience who maybe are
not that familiar with the European
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions, it's a mechanism whereby
these members of the Parliament can come
[SPEAKER_01]: together around a common issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can pull in input from external
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So via associations like ourselves,
industry can have access into that
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can collect knowledge, information,
hear about people's challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: The barriers preventing trade or the use
of the medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can digest all of that as a group
of members of Parliament.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can take those issues
forward to the European Commission,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are the regulators, who will be the
ones creating any draft regulations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future on this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can say, hey, guys, you know,
these are the problems which the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: which patients, which the medical
community are facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to fix this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to start harmonizing
regulation to make these medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: available to European patients equally
across all European countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the formation of that interest
group is a huge step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really indicates that the
parliamentarians are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the need for regulation around
this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the process has to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not be a quick process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we need to start sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now is as good as any.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the first fairly
significant recent development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing which I think is worth
mentioning is the medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe held a conference back in October
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a member of the European
Commission there from directorate general
[SPEAKER_01]: Sante, that's the directorate general,
which is responsible for public health
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made it clear then that they were
going to start a process of creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: glossary of definitions which could be
used to describe medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in relation to the herbal
medicines directive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the herbal medicines directive might
be a way in for the medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products into European regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have recently just announced that
now their committee and the committee
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at this will start work in 2021,
collecting views and information around
[SPEAKER_01]: definitions, how to define medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's an absolute essential
starting point for any European regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: is we need a clear definition of what is
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there is no legal clear
definition under European law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without the definition, you can never
start to regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that process at least is beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two things, I think, are are
quite significant, as I say, quite recent
[SPEAKER_01]: developments in Brussels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we both agree the rules and
the framework of any industry need are
[SPEAKER_00]: paramount in ensuring that it has
longevity and there's no corruption and a
[SPEAKER_00]: gray market as opposed to define the two
markets individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I'd like to
kind of talk to you about in this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: is harmonizing the EU regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're in Ireland at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of comical, the situation that's
been at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the enactment of the law that
happened with the European Council back in
[SPEAKER_00]: December.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't been fully enacted over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can understand the police point of
view when they see a big field full of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or the big plant full of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not to understand which is the
difference between CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you seeing a mishmash of
implementations of these regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: across the EU like what's happening in
Ireland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or has there been a cohesive action and
we're kind of the odd one out as per
[SPEAKER_00]: usual?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know if you're the odd one
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on this particular issue,
maybe you're the odd one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in terms of harmonized view or
regulation on all kinds of aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal cannabis, it's absolutely not
harmonized across Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really is the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nowadays we have 27 EU member
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in each of those member states,
there's a different implementation of all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of aspects of the regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, our particular focuses are on the
regulation allowing an industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's very different from one
country to another at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the German model where there's a
relatively clear model there and
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively clear regulation on how to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other member states where
it's absolutely prohibited to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: industry operating in the medicinal
cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Equally for patients, patient access to
existing cannabis medicines is radically
[SPEAKER_01]: different from one member state to the
other reimbursement on those medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is radically different from one member
state to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all of those aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Irish CBD issue is is one of
those, although it's it's a CBD issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: not let's say not a regulated medicine
issue as such.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, all of those things are in dire
need of harmonization so that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, at least there should be a
minimum level of harmonized regulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: how these things are handled in all 27
member states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a patient in Italy needing access to a
drug for, let's say, epilepsy has the same
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to access that medicine as a
patient in Spain or a patient in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Equally, those drugs should be able to
move cross border with the patient in
[SPEAKER_01]: their hand baggage, just like any other
medicine would move across a border.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those things need to be sorted out
so that we have equal treatment for
[SPEAKER_01]: patients in all countries and an industry
which can operate on level playing field
[SPEAKER_01]: across all those countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today that just simply doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your Irish CBD issue is one example of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully the people in Paris
Central can form these rules and these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations that can the other countries
could just take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it's done as opposed to I can
understand a lot of politicians trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn this as a new industry must be
overwhelming for them to the myriad of
[SPEAKER_00]: things they'd have to learn and how fast
some things are moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult enough when you're already
at the tip of the spear of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind trying to catch up on 15 years
of learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where to go back to my
first point about the interest group of
[SPEAKER_01]: members of parliament forming an interest
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that interest group can can then
listen to existing experiences on
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation in different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: What works?
[SPEAKER_01]: What doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully channel that through
and eventually be reflected in European
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me this and tell me no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to come across a proper
economist's predictions of a European
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this is what the industry looks
like in three years time with a rough
[SPEAKER_00]: figure thrown out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still likes to view Whitney
over in the US who's the head of Whitney
[SPEAKER_00]: Economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does them for the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is detailed financial report as
you should be getting for an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you come across a proper financial
report yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this something that still has yet to
be done by an economist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think that's a little bit
outside of our our kind of field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're more looking at policy and
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than the economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you not think that the economics
goes hand in hand with the convincing the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of them are going to see a
number and say, well, we could create X
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of jobs because all you're hearing
coming out of New York at the moment is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth X amount of billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing X amount of projects to
create X amount of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really cares about anything else
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that should be one of the
doors for the politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's digestible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that they don't understand
as opposed to in the midst of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different myriads of medical and
recreational kind of the do they get their
[SPEAKER_00]: best?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think I've you know,
like you, I've seen the same the same
[SPEAKER_01]: predictions of X billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This this market will be worth X billion
by 2030.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kind of analyses I've
picked up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you're talking about is
something much more detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would say, you know, what what jobs
would how many thousands of jobs would be
[SPEAKER_01]: created around Europe, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that kind of detail at the moment
is is lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even to put it to put a figure on the
industry at the moment, like how many jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: are currently in CBD in each country?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the total revenue, GDP or taxation
for the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's again, I think it's something that
when the funding and the research
[SPEAKER_00]: development is being done, I think this is
one of the things that needs to be looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at as carefully as this is the benefits
that the plant has for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's that was certainly the case
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what convinced a lot of
states in the because of the potential tax
[SPEAKER_01]: revenues which would come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully now that's something that we can
maybe press on and we'll see over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 months of comprehensive financial and
economic report done for about the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and then subset for the CBD
industry, because I think this information
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be the key to us getting a
fully regulated EU industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I mean, just to pick up on your
CBD point again, if I can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from a medicinal point of view,
we are we are talking much wider than CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think CBD, you know, the recent
ruling on CBD is is a kind of it's an easy
[SPEAKER_01]: one, if you like, although it's caused
problems in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a relatively easy one for regulators
to cope with and to to take on board
[SPEAKER_01]: because it has a connection with the
wellness issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's it's relatively soft
and comfortable to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know that CBD in general is not
harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you talk about medicinal
products, then you're talking about CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and many other compounds which are
found in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where that's where the issue of
definitions becomes much more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do we mean when we talk
about medicinal cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely, it's a combination of all
those compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in terms of definitions,
we need to talk about specific compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: when we come to regulate rather than just
medicinal cannabis as a blanket term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think I think I couldn't
agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think medical cannabis is the equivalent
of saying it's jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it bebop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it modern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it slow?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maybe 100 different subsets of
jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think medical cannabis needs to be
treated the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, CBD is just one of those
little myriad of topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a hot topic at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, hopefully it's something we get
to see more detail in each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: component of the industry and more
financial reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you very much for coming
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure to talk to
you, Stuart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we get to talk to you again
before the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks very much for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good luck with your your efforts over
there in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in the next video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
