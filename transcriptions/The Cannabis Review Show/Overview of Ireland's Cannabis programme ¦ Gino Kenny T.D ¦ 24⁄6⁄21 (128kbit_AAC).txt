[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to The Cannabis Review,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on the show by
Gino Kenney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gino is a TD for Dublin Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, Gino?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am great, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've been a long advocate working
in this industry and you've been a
[SPEAKER_00]: campaigner for medical cannabis programme
in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also introduced the legislation to
legalise cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical cannabis has led to a successful
national campaign resulting in the change
[SPEAKER_00]: of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start basically there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the overview at the moment of
Ireland's cannabis programme as you see
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago, almost to the day,
I introduced the bill around medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and obviously it eventually
pushed the government into changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: policy after a very, very long campaign
and also campaigner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Families and individuals had campaigned
for access for themselves or the family
[SPEAKER_01]: members.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the kind of the cutting edge
of the campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, the medical cannabis
programme will commence in the next,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first time, if you have a
qualified condition under the programme,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get a medical cannabis product
described for that condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's quite restrictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very critical at the time in
relation to the omission of chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can campaign in the very,
very near future in relation to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, widen the scope of the medical
cannabis access programme in relation to
[SPEAKER_01]: other conditions and people getting access
via the long term illness scheme or the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical card.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was as I said, it was a very it's a
long campaign that is in some ways only
[SPEAKER_01]: begun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we keep pushing forward in
relation to kind of reforming and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: people getting access to medical cannabis
via the programme and broadening it out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and can you tell me who's responsible
for the choice of ailments that are be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to receive this programme?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the HPRA, which is the Health Product
Regulation Authority, they commissioned a
[SPEAKER_01]: document in 2017 in relation to medical
cannabis in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recommended a medical cannabis
access programme with them three
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very critical at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an expert group that kind of,
you know, made that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, I said, you know,
why was chronic pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And other conditions omitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gave an explanation, which I
thought was kind of slightly kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, didn't really hold weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're the kind of I suppose they're
the group and kind of authority to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, put the programme together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least it's on the positive side,
at least it's a start, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from where we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been as I said, it's been very
protracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least now families and individuals
can get metal cannabis products under
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription rather than have to go to a
license system, which the license system
[SPEAKER_01]: will still be in existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, families hopefully can get
it under prescription very, very soon and
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to go through all the kind of
bureaucracy and the kind of the arbitrary
[SPEAKER_01]: nature of the licensing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and it brings on to the next topic is
your bill that you're proposing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be debating in the Dull
this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give everybody an overview
of exactly what it is that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be debating in the Dull?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bill I'm proposing to put forward
the cannabis regulation and control bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, this is for recreation use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two issues shouldn't be complied
with in relation to medical and recreation
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they do, you know, sometimes we
can't help that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so the bill, it's been drafted at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to introduce it in the autumn,
probably October, because the Dull comes
[SPEAKER_01]: back on the 14th of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd hope to have the bill ready to go
in around that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it hasn't been drafted,
but it essentially will cause a debate in
[SPEAKER_01]: relation to end of prohibition and kind of
making kind of a legal in a framework of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation and the framework of revenue
and the framework of where people are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, not criminalized for
cannabis use, cultivation and possession,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a failure, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we need to go beyond failure
and go beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go beyond failure, you have to
look at something very, very different and
[SPEAKER_01]: a paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shift is legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bill hopefully will kind of
instigate that debate and kind of create a
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, I suppose, you know, I suppose an
atmosphere where, you know, we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: look beyond the kind of very antiquated
laws around cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what it will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The finer, finer details.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't really comment at the
moment because obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get you back and we can discuss
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me an example, let's say for
everybody watching here, let's talk us
[SPEAKER_00]: through the procedure if it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bring a bill to the door,
you'll debate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you convince your opposition
that they're going to be in favor of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're proposing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says, yeah, the bill gets
proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk us through like the next three
important steps that happen that bill then
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to let's say it progresses to
where there is a dispensary that somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: can go in with a medical card who's
already age of 21 and can access that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: adult consumer without being it under a
medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many, what's the duration of time and
how many?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to put a time frame on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, things in here work extremely
slow, especially if you're in opposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of opposition bills
never see the light of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never get passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they introduce the bill,
it's debated and then it's voted down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens to the vast majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even bills that kind of go beyond
that, which would be second stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they go into committee stage or
pre-legislative scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's every chance that it will never
see the light of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see if the opposition came in and
can they take your idea and your bill and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it forward themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they want to do that, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the government say, you know,
OK, we looked at your bill, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we well, you know, and we let it pass the
committee stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some ways, it has happened over
opposition bills where like an opposition
[SPEAKER_01]: idea or a bill has been basically the guts
of it has been taken by the government in
[SPEAKER_01]: situ and they've legislated for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to do that, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't I'm not sure if that will
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing is that we introduce a
bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a debate in the doll.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a vote very soon after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the doll then gives
direction on where the bill needs to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it kind of be does it fall
completely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an amendment to the bill?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the best case scenario that,
you know, it's it's voted on and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: it's agreed that it goes to probably
pre-legislative scrutiny or committee
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be that would be a
big kind of step in what I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: In relation to end and prohibition or if
it could get to that stage, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-legislative scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a long, long way to go in
relation to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously a numbers game as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government have a majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they want to vote any opposition
bill down, they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would be looking for support in the
government, particularly the Green Party.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Green Party have a very good policy
around cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd be hoping for for their support,
whether they're in a kind of pact with
[SPEAKER_01]: Fianna Gail and Fianna Fáil and kind of,
you know, coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we'd be looking for a broad,
a broad spectrum of support to look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of merits of legalisation and end and
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last topic that we want to talk
about is the inflection point for
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads us on from what we were just
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be the case of like Fianna
Fáil and Fianna Gail?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the Green Party, so you guys are
in favour of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other parties that have claimed to not
be in favour, is it going to be job
[SPEAKER_00]: creation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be revenue earned for the
tax and licensing exercise people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it, is it patient access?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the inflection points to you see
politicians actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to support this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen over the last couple of
decades how social issues, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose people power and kind of
persuasion has changed politicians minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a kind of there's a revolution
going on in Ireland in relation to social
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we've just we just just look
back at the last six or seven years of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain issues that were kind of in some
ways slightly taboo, but they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream in some guises.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, drug reform is probably
no different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a lot to do around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will kind of change people's minds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a number of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, public opinion is ahead
of politicians on this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: By I think by a good margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you parole the moving parts of
legalisation on the table, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of people in Ireland,
actually, the majority of people in most
[SPEAKER_01]: countries will say, look, keeping cannabis
illegal doesn't hasn't worked,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to do something very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that different is the the the opposite
of what what is happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's happening now is people are
being criminalised.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going through the criminal
justice system and being criminalised for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to do something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's enough kind of a public
mood out there, you know, to push,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they want change on this,
then things can happen very, very quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and things can happen,
you know, unexpectedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other parties that had a kind of an
opposition to certain things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: minds do change, you know, they do evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cutting edge of kind of that
change is always a public opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's people on the street,
people kind of contacting their TDs and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth and saying, look, on this issue,
we don't we believe that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's wrong to criminalise and criminalise
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to do something very,
very different and with a better outcome
[SPEAKER_01]: with kind of harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all the factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the factors, there's other factors as
well about, as I said, how to approach how
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually could create revenue and how
it could, you know, where does regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's no regulation whatsoever
around cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you have prohibition, then a
vacuum exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does the vacuum people, certain
individuals and groupings will fill that
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuum in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the moment, that vacuum is being
filled in by the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And criminal gangs and they use all sorts
of unscrupulous tactics to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to kind of for distribution and
bringing miners into the kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty insidious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why allow that to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, governments are allowing this to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're they're waiving control over
the distribution of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what Air Bill would do is
basically cut the black market out,
[SPEAKER_01]: not entirely, because I think sometimes
there will be, you know, there will
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously be kind of the black market in
the background, but less so in relation to
[SPEAKER_01]: end of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the factors on, you know,
and, you know, trying to kind of debate
[SPEAKER_01]: TDs that may be in opposition to it and
kind of teasing the kind of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: they may have concerns about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that factors, I think, will be a
kind of very robust debate and an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting debate in the in the next
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that debate needs to maintain
the fact that any revenue comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry needs to go back into
the stakeholders in each neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: where that industry is making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So police reinvestment, schools
reinvestment, health reinvestment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just an industry that's there
to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an industry that's there to generate
revenue for the community that those
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help benefit anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'd want to be a cold
hearted SOB to even not be in favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, regardless of what your stance on
other drugs may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think things are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you see the United States,
you see Mexico, you see other countries
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are looking at things differently
than they've done what they were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of, you know, the misuse of
drugs, the act itself is quite antiquated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it needs to be performed,
particularly on cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's obviously there's a kind
of a middle road called decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all for decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't decriminalization,
particularly on cannabis, doesn't go far
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be talking about legalization
and regulation use market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're talking about
decriminalization, it kind of fudges the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people, like I think the majority
of TDs would be for decriminalization in
[SPEAKER_01]: some form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they need to go before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been talking about this for
decades, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this place, they can, it's a talking
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest with you, there's a lot of
talk and a lot of action, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and particularly around issues where,
you know, where working class people are
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a class issue as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to kind of, you know,
keep kind of raising the issue around kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of why kind of prohibition and kind of
criminalizing people for personal drug use
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't, it's counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think other countries have seen
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to have to do something
different because, you know, it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, you know, it's about kind of,
it's a societal thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an issue where, you know,
people can be drawn into that kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In relation to distribution of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can, as I said, that can be very
insidious in relation to communities and
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to do something very different
from what has happened and what will,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what will be the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that future is ending prohibition and
kind of doing something very, very
[SPEAKER_01]: different than what we're doing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the generations move along,
as I said, I think those outdated policies
[SPEAKER_00]: that became in the Reagan era are long
since gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody born after 1980 now has a bit of
cop on about them and understands the
[SPEAKER_00]: world that they live in and grew up with
this as a thing and realize the garbage
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out there in the illegal market and
the fact that it's now considered like
[SPEAKER_00]: wine over in California with billion
dollar companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those companies aren't going to just
sit over there once they're allowed to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be over here in Ireland,
should be taking advantage of the jobs and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to come here with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gino, I can't thank you enough for
coming on the show, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to touch base towards the
end of the year and find out more details
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field and give everybody a little
bit more information for the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: day and keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, pal.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
