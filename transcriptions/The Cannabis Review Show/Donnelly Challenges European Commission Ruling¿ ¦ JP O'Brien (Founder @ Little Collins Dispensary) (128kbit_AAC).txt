[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by JP O'Brien.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the co-founder of Lytton Collins
Dispensary with a number of locations
[SPEAKER_00]: around Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, JP?
[SPEAKER_01]: G'day Owen, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we had this episode just to
kind of go over Stephen Donnelly's recent
[SPEAKER_00]: backtracking on the legislation the
European Commission have brought forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you give us your overview so far of
what you know, JP, of the situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Owen, what's happened here is the
article that came out during the week,
[SPEAKER_01]: although really poorly worded,
was essentially highlighting the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: the current government is indeed
challenging, I guess, the European Court
[SPEAKER_01]: of Justice Cannavape decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is to do with hemp cannabis with
0.2% or less CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's to do with the ongoing High Court
proceedings here in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be our company and there
would be a number of other companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going through their own legal
proceedings in order to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mate, what this means sort of in
normal language is that the government
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that hemp cannabis with 0.2% or
less, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: what our company and many other companies
have been providing the Irish people for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last three years, they believe that it
is against the public health for this
[SPEAKER_01]: product to be supplied to people and they
would like to medicalise or
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticalise this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so basically we've had a couple of
articles to Stephen Donnelly a year or so
[SPEAKER_00]: ago said that he was open to some sort of
legislation happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I found some information that
basically we had Luke Flanagan asked
[SPEAKER_00]: questions in the European Council about
this in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021, basically saying that, can anybody
give an answer why the European government
[SPEAKER_00]: are going against the European Commission
ruling by banning the sale of CBD goods?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found this reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from the European Commission's
database themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically is from a lady by the
name of Miss Stella Kyriakides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be butchering her name,
but she's basically the commissioner for
[SPEAKER_00]: health and food and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this basically says from what we can
make all sense of that they did say this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's only each individual state can
then come to their own ruling and decide
[SPEAKER_00]: on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is a case of lobbying
from the pharmaceutical industry have now
[SPEAKER_00]: finally gotten to the politicians and
they've slowly started to change their
[SPEAKER_00]: mind on the topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's interesting you say that,
Owen, because we're literally we're about
[SPEAKER_01]: four weeks away from Little Collins' three
year anniversary of actually opening
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years ago this time in 2018,
we were already selling online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, it's been said many times
before, but every single arm of the
[SPEAKER_01]: government at that point, every single arm
of the state was totally fine with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what actually happened is in 2018,
a grassroots hemp cannabis industry sprung
[SPEAKER_01]: up in Ireland via a lot of existing
operators and some new operators like
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government was asleep at the
wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This product is legal in Europe,
but they didn't have their act together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly then a year or two later,
they've gone, hang on a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd really like a piece of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd really like to get that product and
take it and give it to our partners over
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, this is against the public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero point two percent to any THC is
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to take this and we need to give
it to the pharmaceutical companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: start again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's happening against the public
health is kind of, I mean, anyone knows
[SPEAKER_01]: that this product is not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening is an exercise in
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exercise in policy on the run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, mate, as you say,
there is lobbying happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lobbying happening from huge
overseas companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an exercise in private interests
dictating public policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I've been doing a number of
interviews and mapping around Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: the different industries, different
territories, who's big and who's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I can seem to notice is that the
major players in Europe at the moment are
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest pharmaceutical hubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Denmark, Malta, these are all places
with a big pharmaceutical manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities already in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be just coming to the stage
where the pharma guys are ready to now get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the market and they're just trying to
flex their muscles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I guess I guess what's missed
throughout all of this is this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be harmonized from, you know,
crop to shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's missed throughout all of this
is the farmers and the ecological debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't get to that unless you can
just get rid of the kind of confusion and
[SPEAKER_01]: really nonsense that's happening right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, without going into the high court
proceedings, I've had a good look at their
[SPEAKER_01]: argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, it's a house of straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a house of cards,
I should say, and it doesn't stand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, we need to take it one step at
a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why this issue has come up recently is
because of Paul Murphy TD obviously asking
[SPEAKER_01]: Donnelly there in the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it's just highlighting the
duplicitous nature of these TDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Martins World that came out
during the week and reminded everyone that
[SPEAKER_01]: Donnelly himself when he wasn't a TD was
he was all for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a little bit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm this cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the that was the full
strength cannabis, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get that off the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, it's at the stage for me where
it's that's you know, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat it lightly, but it is a bit of a
joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a strategic war at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a war of attrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daily battle to run this business,
I cannot even and any operator would be
[SPEAKER_01]: the same running a hemp cannabis business
in this country right now is a battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it might become sterner before
it gets easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does become, let's say, medical
grade regulated, would you still use this
[SPEAKER_00]: product in your your own stores and your
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you feel that it would be an
inferior product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we wouldn't be able to because we we
wouldn't be able to get to use the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The raw product would be off off limits
for anyone bar, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a licensed sort of medical pharmaceutical
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to wipe out the existing
industry and supplant it with a gentrified
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we make our products from raw hemp
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We import the cannabis that we'd much
prefer to be getting it from a farm up the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the farm up the road, the government
telling to destroy its crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they win, Little Collins, all of these
businesses, they're all gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will all be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the only businesses that will be
there selling the CBD products that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know today will be businesses selling
these, you know, kind of generic label
[SPEAKER_01]: products and whether they're zero point
zero or zero point two, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see, let's say, state regular
federalization over in America being a big
[SPEAKER_00]: swing and conductor for the our side of
the argument over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what that happens, you're going to
have a recreational marketer come to
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, whether they like it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I mean, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of, you know, that's a few
steps down the line, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in our in our mind, mate,
the first battle just has to be one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just have to get over this hurdle
and work out what is happening with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't we can't move on to anything
sort of bigger until we work out how the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD thing's going to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the truth that that needs to be
acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is the defense of public health
irrelevant, really, and farcical,
[SPEAKER_01]: the you know, the fact is they why they're
delaying it so much is they don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: plan for how to implement a fair industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only plan they have is how to hand the
industry over to their business partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a plan to implement
legislation around the current thriving
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to wipe it out and start
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need to get a plan and they need
to get their heads out of the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need to go with the actual word
of law, because the word of law in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: from the European Court of Justice,
they are willfully running against that
[SPEAKER_01]: and not not just in one department,
in many departments, Department of Health,
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture, Revenue,
Customs, the Garda, they're all running
[SPEAKER_01]: against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a battle is going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is your court case exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the viewers can keep supporting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're up next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're up for a mention next week,
mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, he seems to think we're going to
hear some things by December.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say Q1 next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look, it can't come fast enough
because customs just love taking
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's product on the way in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I say, it's a it's a battle to do
business, but everyone is still going
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, everyone's kind of coming
together in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look, look out for hopefully a bit
more news next week, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody stay tuned to Little
Collins Twitter pages and Instagram pages,
[SPEAKER_00]: the websites below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go order some stuff and support the battle
that they've got going on against the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully everybody's victorious and
we get to see a thriving industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland with some proper homegrown
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry you're so rushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all good, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we will do these again in the
new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to catch up and give everybody
an overview of what we know and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can all make their own informed decisions
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Thank you.
Thank you.
