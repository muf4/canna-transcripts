[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Matt Lemaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the International Cannabis Markets
correspondent for MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping, Matt, are you well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been following all your articles
regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're one of great sources of information
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to basically maybe give
everybody a quick little overview of how
[SPEAKER_01]: you got into the industry and where you
are at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah, just briefly, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a journalist for almost 20
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Canadian, but I grew up outside of
Canada for a lot of my adult life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved back to Canada about four
years ago, specifically to take this job,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the international editor for MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live near Toronto here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you see the industry's growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been around so quickly in the time
that you've been in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the media side of things
starting to ramp up a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be the slowest side of the
industry I've seen so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the media side grew too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking in Canada anyways, the media grew
faster than the actual industry in 2018
[SPEAKER_00]: and 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, quite a few cannabis
journalists lost their jobs, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were a lot of people reporting on
this industry two years ago, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not very many of us left in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry needs more reporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs more light than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a lot of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs just rigorous analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of one thing that might be
missing in other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, we have a bunch of journalists
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure how many dedicated
journalists are reporting on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in Europe or in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably need more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's hope we see a lot of people take
up the bat now over here because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to see the momentum in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kick things off with the
first topic of conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the fate of the Canadian LPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a roller coaster, even as of 18
hours ago, the stock scene to be censored
[SPEAKER_01]: by the news from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see the fate?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see the fate of the Canadian
LPs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see them devouring each other until
there's just one dominant company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see the revert mergers that have
happened recently then being able to just
[SPEAKER_01]: compete for market competition themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, though, I would warn people
against tracking the stock market and
[SPEAKER_00]: concluding that that's kind of a barometer
for the health of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stock market and the health of
cannabis companies are not connected at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen that in the last five years
when all the cannabis companies in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: that were publicly traded soared in
valuation, even though they had no
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental reason to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't follow the stock market very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check in on cannabis stocks
approximately once a month, maybe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never report on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a distraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not helpful for businesses or for
investors because, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fundamentals of the companies are so
separated from how they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: performing on the stock market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no correlation at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that you need to really get to
know who's on the board of directors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get to know the CEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say get to know, I don't mean
picking up the phone and calling them and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, reading up on his
background, like, has the CEO ever done
[SPEAKER_00]: this before?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the board of directors look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the board of directors have people
who have been successful in their careers
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry or an adjacent industry
in the past?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most companies, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most companies are led by CEOs who have
just never done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boards of directors have people who
have never done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see them struggling now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll say there's one thing that that
doesn't apply to is founders.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if you're going to found a cannabis
company, that doesn't mean you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, the founder has to step
aside or someone who has done that before
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring the company to the next stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that almost all the
Canadian LPs fail to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the founders stuck around for
years too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even have to say the names
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stuck around too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now their companies have lost billions
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the key mistakes they
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the voices I love listening to the
most in the industry is a guy called Rob
[SPEAKER_01]: McPherson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's based out of Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he always makes the point that a lot
of these companies are in the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: goods business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not in the cannabis industry and
stuck in your board or having the
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise of consumer goods makes complete
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the leadership in the
companies, there's pretty much little to
[SPEAKER_01]: know people who have actual experience in
these exact industries that they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which kind of leads me into this next
topic now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leadership in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me the top three qualities you think
a CEO for a cannabis company need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the founder now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that the founder should be
bringing in to run the ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the top three qualities you think
they should have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first he or she has to have a
vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just come in, even if you're
an experienced CPG executive, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: just come in and run your cannabis company
like you would any other CPG company
[SPEAKER_00]: without any kind of vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What customers are you looking to delight?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be looking to delight everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of businesses make here in this
industry is that they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we want to be the market share leader,
but what market exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just want to be the Canadian
market share leader without specifying
[SPEAKER_00]: which customers in Canada specifically you
want to meet demand for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't meet demand for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, you'll try and lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have a vision, a very
specific vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be disciplined, I think is the
most important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we haven't seen much
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say maybe in 2018 to 2020, maybe lately
we have a lot of CEOs now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have the discipline probably that
they needed a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than pulling the trigger on that
$800 million M&A, you got to step back and
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, what's this really going to
accomplish for my company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I pay $800 million for this company
that has no revenue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really a good idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the third one, I don't know,
the first two are probably the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one, I don't know, maybe you
need to be a little bit flexible and
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptable in how you're planning your
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're just going to bank on
one market, you might get burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although when I say that out loud,
it doesn't sound that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you need to do if you're an
executive is you really need to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can actually make money,
real money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where are the real markets today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the markets that are in your investor
deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of companies, a lot of publicly
traded companies will have a slide in
[SPEAKER_00]: their investor deck that says there's a
global opportunity that's three or $400
[SPEAKER_00]: billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that is accessible to your
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it in your investor deck?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the third most important thing is
just that you have to be realistic and be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest with yourself and your investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that $300 billion slide in your
investor deck is not honest with yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: or your investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think it should be legal to
be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 99% of that market isn't
addressable for the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you even talking about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing in Europe we're lacking
now is good financial analysis and reports
[SPEAKER_01]: of the industry over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a lot of the usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry will be worth $100 billion by
2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: But realistically, it's not 2024 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to know what it can do now for the
investor and for the entrepreneur setting
[SPEAKER_01]: up the company and for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to end with the last topic,
which is basically M&A's in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is the year where we're
going to see most of the M&A's?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think the US having a nationwide
industry will be that year that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: will be the real year of M&A's?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your thoughts on the Hexo red
can deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just broadly, I guess, in Canada,
all of the LPs are talking to each other
[SPEAKER_00]: about M&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's talking to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's slowing it down, I guess,
is that there's not a lot of successful
[SPEAKER_00]: LPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some successful LPs, but they're
the quiet ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think earlier you asked about traits
of a CEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that the most successful
CEOs that I've seen in Canada are the
[SPEAKER_00]: quietest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually the guys that are
privately owned, the publicly traded CEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEOs are usually noisy and they're doing
interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on MSNBC and they're on Bloomberg
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's mostly a distraction
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, get down to business
and just run your business rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to talk about your stock so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big distraction for companies
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was your question again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, do you think that 2021 is going
to be the M&A's?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think when the states basically
have statewide access and the big boys in
[SPEAKER_01]: there start gobbling up the competition,
do you see that that year that that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens is going to blitz the year that
we're having so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question, but it's hard
to say because it's also dependent on what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in Congress, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess M&A in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is slowly picking up, but it's not really
picking up as much as you might expect it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense because if you're a
CEO of a big American cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_00]: investing a lot of money in another
business comes with the risk that your
[SPEAKER_00]: investment might be moot a year from now,
depending on how the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what regulations come
into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of taking a big risk right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spending a lot of money on M&A
in the states, the business you buy could
[SPEAKER_00]: be useless one or two years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, maybe you might be
getting a pretty good deal on that M&A
[SPEAKER_00]: because it might be a lot more expensive
in a couple of years when you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory landscape is going to look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulatory landscape is pretty
settled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is we don't have a lot of
successful LPs and competition is so cut
[SPEAKER_00]: throat that a lot of M&A just isn't
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of Hexo's deal for Redican or
Reedcan, I think that was a great deal
[SPEAKER_00]: because there weren't a lot of LPs in
Canada that grew their market share in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I should take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were quite a few, but they were the
smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Redican was probably one of the few
large LPs that expanded its market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think their market share doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going off memory here, but I think it
was approximately three or four percent to
[SPEAKER_00]: seven or eight percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pretty significant portion of
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a successful company that's probably
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That expanded its market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has loyal customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a good reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great acquisition by Hexo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go on and say it was probably the
best acquisition by a Canadian LP in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last three or four years because how many
LPs can claim to have bought another LP
[SPEAKER_00]: that was profitable and that's growing
market share?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very many.
[SPEAKER_00]: None come to mind right now, but there
might have been a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it expensive at almost a billion
dollars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, the company is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two deals that Sebastian made
were a little bit risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wonder if because he also bought a
couple of smaller LPs this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wonder if he would have pulled
the trigger on those two smaller M&A's.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he had known that this deal with
Redican was going to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I mean, I guess I give
Sebastian credit because he's going for it
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to be the biggest or he wants to
be among the top three LPs in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas companies like Tilray and Canopy,
I'm not going to say they're ignoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian market, but they really have
their focus squarely.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the US market and the European market,
which is extremely risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't invest in stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I did, I think I would probably bet
on the company that had a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: probability of success in a market that's
defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: For somebody like that, he's getting all
the patents going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a defined market,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what their customers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't say the US market is
defined yet because we don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules and regulations are going to look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rules and the regulations kind of
set the boundaries for where businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: can compete in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also set the limit for where the
market, the legal market can reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Canada, for example, you couldn't
sell edibles in the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically for the first two years,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the limit of the market, the ceiling
was relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we're getting more and more
products, the ceiling for this market is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European market, there's more that's
unknown than that's known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every business that's participating in
the European market is taking a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think everyone knows that,
although I don't think most investors
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The executives sure are aware of that,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at even Denmark, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denmark market was doing very well in
2018 and 2019 and then just fell off a
[SPEAKER_00]: cliff in 2020 because regulators,
I'm not going to say they stopped caring,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they took their eye off the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an example of if you're competing
in a regulated medical marijuana market,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your regulator is doing is absolutely
essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some reason, the Danish regulators
kind of started promoting this bizarre
[SPEAKER_00]: export strategy for the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this weird situation in
Denmark now where Danish producers are
[SPEAKER_00]: selling medical marijuana that was made in
Denmark, in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no locally made medical
marijuana in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have only like five or six hundred
customers in the last quarter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dropping the bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a sign that the local
population is just completely ignoring
[SPEAKER_00]: that pilot scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an example of how regulations
can be extremely risky in a hyper
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market like medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another point I want to make in terms
of the global cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: to put things in perspective, just getting
a little bit off topic, but I think this
[SPEAKER_00]: is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very, very early in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this medical marijuana, I'm not going
to call it an experiment, but in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana and the growth of the
medical of the global medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look that I can look at Australia,
for example, their market was only worth
[SPEAKER_00]: one hundred million dollars last year,
one hundred million dollars divided by
[SPEAKER_00]: dozens of companies competing for that one
hundred million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not much left over,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is why you have so many companies
that are losing money right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia and in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to put that into perspective and like
how early, how young is the global medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana market in Australia and Germany
everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canadian military reimbursed their
veterans about one hundred and one hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and twenty million Canadian dollars last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is more money than was spent in all
of Australia's medical marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Canadian military, if it was a
country, would be one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana markets in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not saying the Canadian
military spending too much money because
[SPEAKER_00]: they would either be reimbursing veterans
for medical marijuana or they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursing them for opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, medical marijuana is better
for you than opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows that who looks into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an example of how young the
industry is and how much potential there
[SPEAKER_00]: is for growth in Australia and Germany and
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canadian military reimbursed their pay
their veterans something like 14000
[SPEAKER_00]: kilograms of medical marijuana last year,
which is more than the entire European
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated medical marijuana industry for
unapproved medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's room for growth, tons of room
for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people have to be aware of how early
we are in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are going to go wrong,
like in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, things are going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to rise probably,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only assume that, but you have to
plan for setbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a business, if you're an
investor, you're not going to count on
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada has been doing this for over 20
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canada has the biggest regulated,
federally regulated medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: market in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's taken us 20 years to get to this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a country that legalizes medical
marijuana, let's just say, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know France is doing an experiment,
but say they end the experiment tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like, screw the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to legalize medical
marijuana and we're going to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to take over 10 years for
that market to develop and to grow and to
[SPEAKER_00]: even come close to its potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these forecasts that the
European medical marijuana market are
[SPEAKER_00]: unregulated for regulated unapproved
medical marijuana is going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy number by 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those predictions are going to be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very wise words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to end it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody who wants to check out
Matt's work, check out MJBizDaily.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, it's been an absolute pleasure
having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can talk again in the future and
dissect everything and see how everything
[SPEAKER_01]: turns out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because from somebody who's been talking
to everybody in Europe, things are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to ramp up pretty quickly here and it
should be a good old ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your input would be valuable on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have a great day, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
