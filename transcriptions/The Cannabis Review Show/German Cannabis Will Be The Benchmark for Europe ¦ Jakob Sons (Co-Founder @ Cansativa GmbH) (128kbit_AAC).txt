[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the latest episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this second
episode by Jacob Sons.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the co-founder of CanSativa over in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a medical cannabis company who are
leading the way in the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping, Jacob?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to thank you very much and very
happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you and your brother are kicking
ass with CanSativa in Germany at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the biggest companies in
the main prominent guys in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
on the first topic where the CanSativa
[SPEAKER_01]: story, how you guys set up and how long
you guys have been in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanSativa story is first of all a
story about two brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother Benedict and me, we founded the
company in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before there was a significant
change in law liberalizing the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market for medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of the main turning points in
the German legal ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was right at the beginning when
Benedict and me decided at a family
[SPEAKER_00]: reunion at a party that we want to engage
in this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company was set up quite quickly,
like overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together with our father, who's a
co-founder, not an active member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: management, but still a co-founder,
we elaborated a quite intense on what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the business case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was mainly a part of my brother,
who's a business engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked on the regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a background in law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, now since four years,
I'm only focusing on the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of cannabis as a controlled
substance, but both in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: and the emerging recreational or to be
recreational market in Germany and Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the first few months and the first
year, 2017 and early 2018, we built up the
[SPEAKER_00]: business, rented our first offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did everything on our own from cleaning
the restrooms to doing all the packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like a two-man show at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In early 2018, still one of the early
movers, we started our distribution in May
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018, the first medicinal cannabis
products that we imported from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands were shipped to pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the point in time in the
beginning of 2018 that we decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: a fundraise and have the first few people
join the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is clearly the story of 2017 and
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of 2018, we had our seed
financing round, which somehow brought the
[SPEAKER_00]: business into a very fast growing VC
funded startup company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first one and a half years of
Cansativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with everybody, when you set up a
company, you roll up your sleeves for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first couple of years and if everything
goes according to plan, then you can start
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing investors' money.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'm curious about, how did you
guys go about getting your products in
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you bring on pharmaceutical sales
staff or is there a main holding company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a company for a number of
pharmacies around Germany where you could
[SPEAKER_01]: go directly to that company and acquire,
let's say, a hundred different pharmacies
[SPEAKER_01]: with your products?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's important to understand
how the pharmacy ecosystem in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacies are operated by individual
pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only allowed to operate up to four
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there is no huge pharmacy
network or some kind of corporate entity
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could lobby to source products
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an individual business that is quite
intense in terms of building relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: and building trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this time, cannabis was a very
young and new market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We challenged the market being best in
service, best in delivery times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not that much into best price at
this time because we decided to build our
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship by customer service and
getting into a real relationship with the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is important is that there are some
very big, full-line wholesalers that serve
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies up to three or four times a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the route of general
pharmaceuticals towards pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a closed shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really manage to get into this
niche just being a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to focus only on direct sales
to pharmacies in this special portfolio of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you manage to meet the expectations in
terms of delivery time, communications,
[SPEAKER_00]: sales channels, and so on, at this time,
it was quite easy to get into touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmacies because they were
desperately looking for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see in the last few years a significant
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, it is very hard to get into touch
with the pharmacies because there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, 80 importers that always want to
sell just, for example, one product source
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pharmacies today are quite
annoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to get addressed by the
80s or 90s importer that only wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell bedroom cannabis, but they want to
have a single point of contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed over time from someone who
had a problem with a product they were
[SPEAKER_00]: desperately looking for in the beginning
towards a one-stop shop that now is
[SPEAKER_00]: offering everything that the pharmacy
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a transition phase where we
profited a lot from being an early mover
[SPEAKER_00]: at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That leads me on to the next topic I want
to talk about, and it's the European
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, anybody with a bit of sense who
knows the industry, it's got to be medical
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first couple of years,
but we see the rumorings of a recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: market happening in Germany with the
recent elections there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see the European opportunity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think recreational is going to be
here within five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does happen in Germany, do you think
that's going to open the floodgates for
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I see, as you outlined,
a European opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a harmonized European economic
zone or economic market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we see more or less in whole
Europe those two dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first dimension is medical or
pharmaceutical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other dimension is, in the broadest
sense, recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we differentiate in those
segments?
[SPEAKER_00]: First, medical and pharmaceutical is what
we see in Germany, especially as one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leading roles, especially because we
have a cost reimbursement system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This always is the driver for innovation
in those sectors or those pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no cost reimbursement,
it is always hard to bring products in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why Germany is most important in
the medical sphere right now, but we see
[SPEAKER_00]: that other jurisdictions are important as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you look at the production,
it might be Portugal or Spain or Denmark,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the place to go to have your
products or pharmaceuticals grown in a
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I think, is in the medical ecosystem
something that is currently developing
[SPEAKER_00]: over different countries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the first trials in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are experiments in other
jurisdictions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first dimension, medical,
I think there is an ongoing and continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: development towards a more liberalized
approach over Europe towards cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical substance, as a medicinal
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see in the second dimension is
clearly recreational in the broadest
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, as I said, because we observed that
in whole Germany, we have in three
[SPEAKER_00]: different segments the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is hemp, especially fiber,
clothing, foodstuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the development of novel food.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a decision on the novel food
status of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be only the beginning of a
roaring and bursting market because there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a significant demand for CBD products,
even though they are now still in the gray
[SPEAKER_00]: or black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the second part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a holistic development in
Europe that we observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third is anything relating to
THC-containing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany will definitely be again a
leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that if our so-called
traffic light coalition will get to
[SPEAKER_00]: operations and if they constitute the
government over the next few weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be quite obvious that over the
next two or three years, we have legal
[SPEAKER_00]: THC-containing cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will again be a leading role model
for Europe because it will show proof that
[SPEAKER_00]: this system works with view to drug
addiction policy, with view to protection
[SPEAKER_00]: of minors and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leads me into the next topic that I
want to talk about is European imports
[SPEAKER_01]: versus European homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that the place to grow your
product at the moment would be Portugal,
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark have the ornamental flower
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal has a great climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see there being a new nuanced
difference between the warmer climates in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe and the specialized farming
countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say somebody like Ireland,
where I am from, we have some of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: farming communities in the world,
never mind just Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I see it happening when the
regulations fall down, you will have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability for each nuanced country to have
their own individual strain with their own
[SPEAKER_01]: individual benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that happening or do you see
the imports from low-cost territories like
[SPEAKER_01]: South America and Africa imported into
multiple places like that turned into
[SPEAKER_01]: products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which do you see being the future for the
European industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it always depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the whole industry is getting a bit
more liberal, first in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem, then in the recreational
ecosystem, we will see that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: product differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will begin that pricing is something
which is very important to get access for
[SPEAKER_00]: the mass market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the low-cost products,
there will be a significant need for
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive cultivation in Latin America,
for example, in Southern Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you cannot really compete with the
labor costs applied to those products
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, especially in the
recreational ecosystem, it is more about
[SPEAKER_00]: the right brand, the right strain,
the right product claim and product
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still today in the medical ecosystem,
patients are very aware of where is the
[SPEAKER_00]: product coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very aware of is the product,
for example, treated with irradiation or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always topics that are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between non-EU cultivation
and EU cultivation might always be a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between is it indoor or
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producing a low-cost product is then a
huge advantage if you are not only
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating in a climate that is good for
the product, not only cultivating in an
[SPEAKER_00]: area where labor cost is low, but it is
always about do you need all those
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive investments in the greenhouses
that are closed and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a competitive advantage here for
those that cultivate in areas that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: better climate than, for example,
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take Germany as the domestic grown
cannabis, it is still ridiculous that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants have to be grown not only
without sunlight, but in a safe room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can't be something that is here a
benefit for domestically grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider that especially in the
recreational industry, there will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: product need or there will be a demand for
product that have a specific terroir that
[SPEAKER_00]: is more important about where is it coming
from, how is the product made,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is more about having a product
that is like in the vine industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: has an origin, a signature, which is not
only pertaining to a strain or genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but always to the origin in terms of what
is the terroir, what is the climate zone
[SPEAKER_00]: it has been grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this will be a story that is
working when building brands better than
[SPEAKER_00]: when building a pharmaceutical product
because their product quality
[SPEAKER_00]: standardization is more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is always easier in a controlled
ecosystem, controlled greenhouses where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can control all those parameters from
light to water to nutrition and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the medical industry are
going to be able to get that product
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect with the amount of capital and
investment in research and development,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the recreational brands are going
to be the story, as you said, the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint, a number of different variables
that the consumer will go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you, Jacob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk to you all day about the
European cannabis industry, but I know
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a busy man and we have the
15-minute time limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who wants to check out Cansatiba,
the website link is below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommend you check them out and
hopefully we can get to talk again in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future, Jacob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, everybody,
for watching and we'll see you on the next
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
