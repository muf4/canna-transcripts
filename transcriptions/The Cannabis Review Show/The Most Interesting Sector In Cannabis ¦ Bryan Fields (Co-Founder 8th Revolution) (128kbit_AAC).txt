[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be here and excited to
dive into the conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can get some information
across to the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we start real quickly at how you
ended up co-founding 8Revolution and your
[SPEAKER_01]: end point into the cannabis industry
please?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my previous life, I was sales and
marketing for an analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation company where my
responsibilities were to grow and develop
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing channels as well as business
development relation channels into new
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were experienced in oil and gas,
pharmaceutical, food and dev.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the new tasks was entering a
new market where I was asked to explore
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2018, I set off to MJBizCon where my
eyes were wide open and I was ecstatic
[SPEAKER_00]: with the speed and the opportunity of the
industry and fell in love with what was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and decided to link up with one
of the people I met at that show,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kellan Finney, who was actually speaking
at the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, we decided that we wanted
to see the industry a certain way,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was an analytical focus,
and we wanted to bring real-time quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control sensors to the cannabis industry
and decided to form 8Revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wealth information coming from the
sector applies a lot to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe tell everybody a little bit
about the Dime podcast that you guys have?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got great guests on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that these are great data gathering
tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you view it the same as yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Dime is our weekly podcast where we
explore all things cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Dime has been the greatest
unlocker from a networking standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to connect with individuals
and spend time with them and then ask them
[SPEAKER_00]: the why behind they make certain
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of times, especially
nowadays, we rush to make judgments when
[SPEAKER_00]: we see headlines, but we don't really
understand the macro and the why that
[SPEAKER_00]: these executives make certain decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the primary focus on the
Dime is to really understand the true why
[SPEAKER_00]: these executives or these leading
researchers are making specific strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions and how they go about their day
to day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to start off basically asking
you what are two things about four
[SPEAKER_01]: different quick topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got things that you specialize in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first is license acquisition.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody looking to open up their own
business, what's more important for
[SPEAKER_01]: license acquisition, consulting company
like yourself or legal expertise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which step comes first for the
entrepreneur if they're trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves a license?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they work hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think relationships are really paramount
in this space and making sure that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: off on the right foot is really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work very closely with a lot of law
firms where we specialize in this area to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that we work hand in hand with the
clients to make sure that everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: operating at the same speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, the de facto answer is
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one is facility design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there specific architecture companies
that work now specifically solely
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you really find companies that would
find any industrial buildings and
[SPEAKER_01]: complexes are the ones that are for the
cannabis in the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't really hear the end of that,
but I can make some assumptions on the
[SPEAKER_00]: true direction of the facility design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that certain layouts
and procedures help with the optimization
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flow of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just putting those necessary steps in
line allows for the operator to not have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go backwards and to take, let's say,
reverse steps that are more costly and
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive, which could set back a facility
a large amount of money if they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to take certain steps, let's say like CGMP
or to do other profit maximization in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put your if you can't hear me,
just let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this question is on equipped selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is this something if you were setting
up a company as an entrepreneur,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you specifically hire some
expertise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a field working with cannabis or is
it any engineer or a highly intelligent
[SPEAKER_01]: individual could move or understand pretty
quickly what the equipment is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I couldn't make that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just start this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for equipment selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is expertise required in choosing
equipment or is it something on which an
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur could learn to reach?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think an entrepreneur can figure it out
through their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that's special
for us is that my partner, Kellen Finney,
[SPEAKER_00]: has got extensive background in the
various different extraction space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's understanding the variables on
what is the end product and then likes to
[SPEAKER_00]: work back through exactly what the client
is looking to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is possible that an
entrepreneur can get their hands dirty and
[SPEAKER_00]: do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, selecting equipment is
necessary earlier on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making a step like CGMP might be
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if let's say the end goal is
differently from what we are expecting to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce, you want to make sure that the
beginning steps align with that end goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one on this topic is
optimization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those big hurdles a lot of
companies come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, is this something that in-house
talent can be obtained or is it always was
[SPEAKER_01]: going outside of equities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the better and superior option in that
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a great question and really
depends on the operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most important thing that we
found is that data is king and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding which variables are
currently controlling that optimization
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters and allowing insights into real
time in order to maximize your profit is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the driven goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not really understanding
which variables are influencing your
[SPEAKER_00]: output, it's really going to be hard in
order to lock down that optimization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've seen is a big margin
compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's talking about a race to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of figuring out, hey,
let's raise our prices and push it back on
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to approach that is to look
inwards and to figure out what are our
[SPEAKER_00]: costs and where can we make influences to
really drive down our internal costs so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can maximize our profit and
therefore optimization of our process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, which I think is going to be a
bit of information for young entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_01]: there just in that little section.
[SPEAKER_01]: The section I wanted to move on to now is
the most interesting sector of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as we know, technology advancing
rapidly every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see is going to be the most
interesting sector of cannabis now today
[SPEAKER_01]: and in five years time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: At five years time is really hard to tell,
especially with the industry and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it's operating now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be technology again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are going to take an
inwards focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to adopt outside industry
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process analytical technology is one that
obviously with my background, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: confident it's going to move to the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in pharmaceutical, it's in oil and
gas, it's in food and beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the type of equipment that
will help consistency in product line
[SPEAKER_00]: across state by state so that when you do
grab a product in New York, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar or not close or exactly the same
as the one in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see biotechnology overtaking a
large chunk of the cannabis industry once
[SPEAKER_01]: these biotechnology companies have gotten
their cell lines and their large
[SPEAKER_01]: quantities that they can manufacture to
specific price point and exact yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: like virgins, edels, creams, tinctures,
oils, potentially come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger harvests, more frequent harvests,
the price point is going to be lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that scenario ending up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think new methods of extraction
are going to be able to cope with the
[SPEAKER_01]: biotechnology sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: It remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't feel confident speaking on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is outside of my expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would really lead into my partner,
Kevin Finney, or who could expand on
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in this space, the speed at
everything is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really challenging to recognize what
is possible, what is really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in the short and near term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very much agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the most exciting thing of the 12
agents you look for seeing in your
[SPEAKER_01]: territory in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see how New York rolls out
their cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big ask what they're doing,
and it's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the MSOs have shown some
frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're interested to seeing if it's
possible to what they are able to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have casted their
doubts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things that
fascinates me most is that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a live case study on exactly what is
possible and what is not when opening up a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive market and limiting certain the
entrance coming in, and how they plan on
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling out that market in the next eight
to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see mergers and acquisitions being
a big part over the next 12 months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would it only be when legalization
happens that you start to see an activity
[SPEAKER_01]: ramp up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think over the next eight to 12 months,
you might see some mergers and
[SPEAKER_00]: acquisitions, but more of the distressed
assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect to see some of the smaller
operators maybe pass through and get
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired for pretty cheap multiples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with the capital markets
operating the way they are, I think people
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a little more hesitant to deploy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my understanding is that a lot of
these larger companies will look inwards
[SPEAKER_00]: from an optimization standpoint in order
to hone in on their internal efforts so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when the markets do move in the other
direction, they're ready to scale faster
[SPEAKER_00]: again, but they've really honed in on the
internal infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wouldn't surprise me if we saw
outside industry tightness continue to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to migrate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the word on the street right
now is big tobacco, and everyone's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: yes or no, depending on how your strategy
is and if it's good or if it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remains to be seen on how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some may think it's pretty disruptive,
and others may think it's a pretty opening
[SPEAKER_00]: invitation from the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think the current selection of
MMOs in America are going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant forces in a few years' time,
or has the most successful cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: company in America still yet to win?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that one's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a second to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends if the US gets locked into the
US markets, because from our understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, if we haven't federally
legalized it, we will not be involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: global conversations at a world level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are not partaking in those
conversations, the US companies might be
[SPEAKER_00]: locked in and might have to take creative
approaches to outside partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen Chiraleaf do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a couple others expand to
overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, they're pretty much
independent entities, which don't allow
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to operate with the economies of
scale that really what the everyday
[SPEAKER_00]: investor is used to seeing from a numbers
standpoint, as you've seen with these
[SPEAKER_00]: larger companies outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen some of the MSSOs take an
interest in Europe already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiraleaf's acquisition of 420 Pharma
being one of the latest to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that American companies are
looking at Europe with blinker and
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that the market is there for the
taking, or do you believe it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: European cannabis companies not only
thrive, but move to America to take it to
[SPEAKER_01]: that market too?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the companies that we've spoken
with directly on those questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they think there's a ton of meat in the
bone still here in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: With major markets still not opening up
and limited to capital, they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: internally right now on states like
Florida and Texas, Alabama, North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina, potentially Pennsylvania,
and Maryland in the next two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're looking internally
right now with an eye on the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're pretty confident that there is
a lot of meat on the bone internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think they look for a global
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think right now, the focus is going
to be currently on internally expanding
[SPEAKER_00]: locally and domestically with a focus on,
let's say, internationally over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: two to five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had $100 to put on MSSO stock,
where would you be throwing your money?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a couple of people
pretty angry at that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no really good choices to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is my favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Trulieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTI, I'm a big fan of Ben as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still so early in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's certain things that certain
operators do that I like more than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more strategic efforts that I
like that others do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Terracent's got a very
limited footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very, very strategic in the
markets they're attacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe over the next two to five years,
they start to rise in growth and start
[SPEAKER_00]: competing with the bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trulieve is right now dominating Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Florida is a smaller market of its own
in comparison to a global landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Florida turns, Trulieve's numbers
could be massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they open up that market,
then Trulieve's numbers might disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to really feel super
confident on anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the craziest part about the
cannabis industry as a whole is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: way the cannabis industry operates now,
everyone has their cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think of that from a card game
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, federal legalization,
interstate commerce will come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone will have to re-deal their
cards in and then redistribute their
[SPEAKER_00]: assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these vertical integration assets
that are happening now don't allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: economies of scale and don't allow for a
sharing of knowledgeable competence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really driving home price
because we're not able to have one massive
[SPEAKER_00]: hub of cultivation somewhere and then
dispersing the products elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got different states growing
products across the region, which just
[SPEAKER_00]: makes more challenges for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have one master grower
overseeing the entire operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got multiple master growers,
which leads to more challenges and more
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses and more likely more hurdles and
less profits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it seems to be what happened
with Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: The small cultivars and the small batch
operator, the one taking a huge,
[SPEAKER_01]: huge to the share at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the larger Canadian MSOs are the ones
struggling who have fantasized about the
[SPEAKER_01]: size it yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been sold off at a fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the start before I let you go
on cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you think is the best cannabis
tourism company in most of America?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't participated on any of those
cannabis tourism, so I can't speak
[SPEAKER_00]: confidently on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would envision that the one that
involves education and experience will be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that can win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to experiencing
the multiple different ones we've
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewed and the different people we
spoke about that are excited to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tourism to a whole new light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the one thing I see in New York in
such a big market because people think
[SPEAKER_01]: people are estimating how much Europe are
going to go to the museum soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is legal and the amount of
revenue that's going to generate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually had a great chat flying
over our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say this is a very informative
discussion for everybody wants to know
[SPEAKER_01]: more about Ryan's company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link is below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommend checking them out and the
podcast The Dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan, thank you very, very much for the
time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to doing this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time, Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will most certainly catch up very soon
with the next six to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have an update.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
