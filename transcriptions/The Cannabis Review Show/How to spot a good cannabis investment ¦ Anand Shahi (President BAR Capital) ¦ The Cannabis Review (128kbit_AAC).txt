[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined by Anand
Shaheed, the President and the Chief
[SPEAKER_00]: Investment Officer for Barr Capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Anand?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely a pleasure to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're going to shine some great
insights into the few questions that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to basically give everybody a
little background on what Barr Capital are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in the industry and how you got into
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cannabis sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start with my background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a finance person to the bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in various different companies
in the financial industry here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: based out of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked at firms like Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done everything from managing assets
for high net worth individuals to managing
[SPEAKER_01]: risk for Morgan Stanley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that period, as I was doing my
corporate career, I was also in parallel
[SPEAKER_01]: investing in startups and small and micro
cap companies in certain sectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I realized as I was doing that is
there's a lot of value when you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty and you have a deep dive into a
vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what started to happen was I realized
that cannabis was all of those things with
[SPEAKER_01]: a completely new and nascent industry
where it could be shaped and knowing the
[SPEAKER_01]: right people and connecting with the right
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And investing in the right companies could
literally make an impact on people's daily
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a personal purpose, I made sure
that everybody who joins Barr Capital
[SPEAKER_01]: knows that our purpose is to make cannabis
as culturally accepted and common as
[SPEAKER_01]: aspirin or alcohol or paracetamol and
alcohol, I guess, in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that purpose drives me every
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get up early, I go to bed late night,
I talk to people in Europe, U.S.,
[SPEAKER_01]: China, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very much looped into what's
happening behind the scenes in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how Barr Capital has come
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been doing outreach to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very glad to meet folks like
yourself and your program, because we
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's a global industry that's going
to only get bigger and bigger as the years
[SPEAKER_01]: come by right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of gives everybody a little
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump straight into the first
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's I'd love to get somebody
like you to be able to maybe clear some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the muddy water so far in terms of the
overview of the current current investment
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got North America, let's say the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: have state by state only investment you
can't invest across or have companies
[SPEAKER_00]: compete across states.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canadian companies seem to have burned
through so much money now that it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: a fool's errand and buyer beware when it
comes to a Canadian LLP and investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe seems to be technically leading
towards the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, how are you looking at
in terms of investment strategies for Barr
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a separate strategy for Europe
that you do for North America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see it all assimilating into one
industry over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this industry is so fractured.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're in New Jersey as a
company involved in cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts here in the United States or
any of these individual states,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might as well be in Europe if you're
trying to interact with another company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't cross the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that creates is some unique
investment opportunities that are
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate plays or geographical plays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we focus on is the scalable
businesses and the brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wrote a short white paper a year
ago, actually, when COVID was hitting and
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry was in a lot of
trouble and a lot of stocks had kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had other issues from before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wrote a paper called The Bold Shall
Conquer Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we argued for was that you want
to focus on businesses that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: effective in New Jersey or Ireland or UK
or wherever and be able to scale at a very
[SPEAKER_01]: fast level and become a global presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that involves a few key aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is you have to have the right
kind of management and the right kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two is you need connectivity and
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where Barr Capital comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We invest in, we advise, and we do help
raise funding for startups and companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are growing in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our consulting side and our strategic
advisory side, which is connected with
[SPEAKER_01]: players in the UK as well and in Europe as
well, is all about supply chain and
[SPEAKER_01]: offtake agreements and connecting the
right kind of companies to each other so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can scale together and they can
scale up into geography that they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: entered before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be pertinent in North
America, especially in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be pertinent for
transatlantic communications and deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really differentiating
ourselves on that front, because like I
[SPEAKER_01]: was saying before, this is a global story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are not understanding that this
is going to be ubiquitous in our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to be taking different
cannabinoids, different formulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: both for medicinal purposes and for
recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give one quick example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a relative who had surgery and was
prescribed opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suggested they get a medicinal
cannabis license and use that instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were able to get that prior to
the surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used it afterwards and potentially
avoided an addiction to opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's the kind of difference
that's already been made in places where
[SPEAKER_01]: it is legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's a very concise and informative
piece to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is a pretty straightforward
question, but a difficult answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you spot a good investment
opportunity in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: bearing in mind that there are so many
rules and regulations in different
[SPEAKER_00]: territories and everything is so much
different in every different territory
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to want to enter?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way for you to spot an
investment?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spotting a great investment is like
finding your future partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a first date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on how that goes,
you might get a second date.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you start to get a sense right away if
there is a click.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the click comes with management and
how passionate they are about what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's easy to tell because
their lives have been changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their child might have had epileptic fits
all day long prior and all medication had
[SPEAKER_01]: been tried and nothing had worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cannabis came along and made a
difference in that executive's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was able to shape how they wanted to
participate in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's other key things we look for
in management, which is can they handle
[SPEAKER_01]: the hockey stick moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they handle a pivot in the business
because they were trying to build a big
[SPEAKER_01]: capex project and instead now the market
has shifted and they should instead focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on their brand and launching products that
make more sense in the current market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you'll see and you mentioned this
earlier in the Canadian story is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies went public too soon because
that was the only way for them to get
[SPEAKER_01]: funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't able to create brands because
the Canadian government is overly involved
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore they're going to suffer and
we're kind of shorting that market and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at managers that short that
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US story is just beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the multi-state operators are
very, very attractively valued even today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think legislation is going to change
and really change the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to the company and spotting
investments, you have to do a set of due
[SPEAKER_01]: diligence, getting to know the family part
of the dating analogy I was giving you,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure the values line up,
making sure all of those things check out
[SPEAKER_01]: and their backgrounds are solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also getting a real sense for do these
folks have legitimate backgrounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Early days in cannabis, there was a lot of
black market participants that moved the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space to what it is today and
helped it get legalized in a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: geographies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they weren't management, they weren't
quality operators in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's shifted now is veterans from other
industries have entered and so we also
[SPEAKER_01]: look for folks that utilize that talent
pool that's coming in from pharma,
[SPEAKER_01]: from finance, from the legal world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of dream team situation is what
we look for where the pieces are lined up,
[SPEAKER_01]: the messaging, the vision, the mission is
being talked about by each of those
[SPEAKER_01]: members of the executive team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, it's a magical
moment and then we usually then proceed
[SPEAKER_01]: with getting to know the company even
deeper and making an investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's definitely a very exciting
time at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got a couple of the brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that at some stage you're
going to have a Burger King and a
[SPEAKER_00]: Coca-Cola come out of the cannabis
industry and it's who gets to those
[SPEAKER_00]: investments now is such, I think,
a great place to be in as a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: investor as you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the brands in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: do you see being some of the dominant
ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know about Cookies and we know
about the Bangs and Kilcliffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you see kind of rising to the top
of the market when it comes to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe being a global brand within
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two parts to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One part is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is often late to the story and then buys
its way in and then tries to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that interaction between the
different geographies right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe has the medicinal program and it's
got great R&D and IP and other talent and
[SPEAKER_01]: other valuable assets even on the
cultivation front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to continue looking to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know of several of the people you're
mentioning and other big names that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actively doing that and then we all,
of course, see deals like the Cureleaf
[SPEAKER_01]: EMAC deal recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's certainly folks that are well
capitalized and they're going out and
[SPEAKER_01]: laying out the footprint that they need to
continue scaling their brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's such a nascent market.
[SPEAKER_01]: New entrants that find the right
connections and find the right capital
[SPEAKER_01]: flow and really have that brand focus can
do very, very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't predict Coca-Cola or the Burger
King of the space yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, I think several of the people
who are already doing quite well are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't be surprised if a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: European brand emerges or an Asian brand
emerges eventually as we mature more and
[SPEAKER_01]: can then start capitalizing, going public
and getting a lot of capital behind their
[SPEAKER_01]: own growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the next three to five years,
I see it being a very U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: dominate world in terms of the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a focus on California and
Germany, for example, and now Mexico,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in very good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think those key geographies will
continue to play a big role in brand
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's anybody's game still.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of leads me on to the last topic
that I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're saying one of the European
brands are going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're betting on that Ireland is going to
be one of the countries that delivers one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these global brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to maybe in this little
segment convince you as to why Ireland is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the European hope for global
cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you'd agree that a lot of the
investment opportunities and the M&A's
[SPEAKER_00]: that are happening, some of the London
Stock Exchange stuff is exciting industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of the North American
companies are definitely going to position
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves for a European entry at some
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a special place in my heart for
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born in India when I was eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually moved to Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents are doctors and they work there
and I lived there for six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was educated partly in Ireland and
then came to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can say, given where Ireland has
positioned itself, the only
[SPEAKER_01]: English-speaking member right now of the
EU being known for its tax benefits to
[SPEAKER_01]: large corporations that have already,
from other industries, utilized it as
[SPEAKER_01]: such.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a natural, natural landing pad for
the larger companies, for innovation
[SPEAKER_01]: around this area, for brand creation,
for interaction between the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on making a business trip out there
and really getting a detailed sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you've already got a brand in
that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland already has a brand in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's all about how do you convert
that and how do you convince the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators to open up more business around
the cannabis space?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, by the way, is just a snowball
effect happening right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have any kind of doubt about
legalization in the U.S., just think of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that Canada and Mexico are going
to be legal federally and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be sitting there missing out
on tax revenue dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-COVID, everybody wants to address
deficits and any kind of new source of
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue generation is golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always, you know, people in the
industry complain that we get taxed too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a beautiful thing to get
taxed too much right now, because
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually, as the lobbying continues,
as we go towards legalization and beyond,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's then going to start looking at
tax efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ireland's going to be very much at the
nexus of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's going to be a lot of the
services will be based in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the kind of B2B business
operations will be based in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, there might be genetics in North
America, but I still think it'll make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense over time to have greenhouses set up
in Ireland, extraction facilities set up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ireland, logistic companies set up in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's exciting future ahead for
Ireland and North America and Europe in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we get to chat about this
again in the next few months when we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got things to progress about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope your regulators in Ireland are
watching and they make a move in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, part of our capital's work
is to promote and educate people and help
[SPEAKER_01]: find the right ways to open up this
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you, Nan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on the show
and I hope you get to chat again very
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you and thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
Bye bye.
