[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode of the
cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joining this episode
by the old Whitney who is the founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitney economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Beal?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically want to give everybody a
chance to give an overview of the jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: report you recently did there with Leafley
at the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you basically maybe give everybody a
quick little overview of how you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: and how long the report took and the
partnership that you guys have had with
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafley since 2019?
[SPEAKER_01]: So previously to 2019, I had been doing
job reports mainly on the Oregon market
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a little bit on the US market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leafley was being asked to opine on the
job potential in the job market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there wasn't really any data out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at one point, Bruce Barcott from
Leafley reached out to me and we started
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the last three years now,
we have published a report in the February
[SPEAKER_01]: timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it covers the previous year's
employment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's been a great partnership.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a great team there at Leafley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've provided some insights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we meet monthly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk about what's going on in the
United States market and keeps all the
[SPEAKER_01]: data fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my team's really strong as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a great partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the key to any industry is
the collection of data and the explanation
[SPEAKER_00]: of that data and the outsourcing of that
data to different companies to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me what are some of the stats
I hear from the report are pretty crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis in 2021 was the most prolific
job creator in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a job created in the
cannabis space once every two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and you asked about how long this
takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we begin production of this and writing
and research and we do it throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really concentrated in the fourth
quarter of each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do the final analysis at the
end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we publish it, like I said,
in February.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the numbers were stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more cannabis related jobs in the
United States than there are plumbers or
[SPEAKER_01]: bank tellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the job creation, like I said,
once every two minutes, that's 280 a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the fastest growing
sectors in the United States from an
[SPEAKER_01]: employment perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you said, 280 jobs a day,
a 33 percent increase from the year
[SPEAKER_00]: previous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you expect the gains to be in double
digits like that for the industry over the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually over to New York myself on
Thursday to go to New Jersey to visit a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of newly opened facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only imagine what the Eastern
Seaboard opening up is going to do to the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very insightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the growth comes from the new
emerging states that are just deploying
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabis programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a while for each one of these
programs to capture the illicit consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: and convert them into the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes several years, almost half a
decade in order to get full maximum
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the West Coast states in the
United States have already captured a
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the demand and converted that
over into legal space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where the action is now is in these
newly deploying states like New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a firm believer that New York
has a pretty close relationship to Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: just for the amount of people who travel
there just on tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can guarantee your report is going to
cover cannabis tourism when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: New York much more prevalently than would
on the Eastern Seaboard or the Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Seaboard, because generally a lot of
European people aren't going to go visit
[SPEAKER_00]: the Western Seaboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: for tourism, whereas New York for a
weekend is a huge thing with Irish people,
[SPEAKER_00]: with UK people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's going to drive the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that I'm going over on Thursday,
I think, is an example that there's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a number of different other people
like that are curious about the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what is going to pop up over
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not just the advantage of
creating jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of economic development
and economic potential that is derived
[SPEAKER_01]: from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So states are now starting to understand
the economic potential of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're embracing it and they're deploying
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the question is, will they mess it
up when they deploy it and then have to
[SPEAKER_01]: take years and years and years to fix it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or will they deploy the program
successfully out of the gate?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there hasn't been any one state quite
yet that's got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I was reading reports on New York we
know don't open up really till autumn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of all the planning and
acquisitions going on at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But New Jersey opened up and they see that
there was no supply chain issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There didn't seem to go off with a hitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there more information that we aren't
being able to read in the media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've taken a different approach to
analyzing these new market deployments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look at it from a supply
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems every state that deploys
a new program runs into a supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: hiccup, be it from testing, from growing,
from retail access and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been really looking at it from
a supply perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got an assessment of the entire
production of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it by state and by illicit and
legal and indoor and outdoor and
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't surprise me that New Jersey
was running into some supply chain issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't have enough growing
capacity to meet the growing demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will continue up until the point
that they actually add more growers to the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing is going on in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York, they don't have enough
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're reaching out to the hemp
growers in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to backfill some of the supply
gaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another opportunity to invoke and
implement interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's an excess of supply in
California and Oregon on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could easily handle the demand on the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's potential agreements in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there hasn't been anything consummated
quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the stats I've been looking over
recently, and I'm sure your manager knows
[SPEAKER_00]: the statistic as much as I do,
the European versus North American market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that basically there's a lot of
money being made from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York looks like it's going to be a big
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general size of the North American
market, it says at the moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: statistic wise, is 368 million covers
Canada, the US and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the North American companies
already starting to pivot towards Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because from statistics, it's 747 million
in Europe versus the stats that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: over in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you end up seeing Europe as being the
holy grail for a lot of these companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: North America anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the North American market always
going to be able to dominate just in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of retail sales?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've got a forecast, a total
addressable forecast for every country in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe is the fourth largest market by
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia and Africa outpace North America and
Europe, but they just haven't deployed any
[SPEAKER_01]: legal programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a dollar perspective,
Europe is the second largest market
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've deployed medical programs
throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got the emergence of adult use
in Germany and Switzerland, and now
[SPEAKER_01]: they're talking about it in France and
Italy and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there are some pivots going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canadians, for example, they are
looking for new markets because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: excess supply as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're looking into forming
agreements into the European market and
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like everybody and their
cousin is looking at the European market
[SPEAKER_01]: for their salvation because the US market
hasn't opened up quite yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody is pointing their supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canadians, the Asians, Africans,
South Americans, they're all gearing up
[SPEAKER_01]: getting EU GMP certified, for example,
GAP certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all targeting their supply
towards Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if I were to give advice,
which I have to suppliers and other
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs, on other continents,
I would say be very careful about entering
[SPEAKER_01]: into the European market from a business
perspective, because you may see a
[SPEAKER_01]: collapse in pricing once all that supply
hits the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's up to the regulators in each
individual country to modulate the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it could really impact the
domestic producers and operators in those
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of the companies seem to
misunderstand the amount of people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: over in Europe who are ready to kind of be
able to be cultivating and will have
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, grow operations themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Europe, of all the
territories, will have that premium flower
[SPEAKER_00]: price, I think, set in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won't be a better race to the
bottom in terms of what I can buy X amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of ounces for Y amount of euros.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be, have you tasted this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like a wine category or like a
food category where people are willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay that little bit more for a premium
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, just like in the United
States, there hasn't been a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: deployment out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a while for the
European countries to get their legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that the policies that I've
seen are protectionist policies,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is appropriate to protect the
domestic market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they favor the local domestic suppliers
and operators and cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll use the foreign suppliers
as burst capacity in case there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: demand that comes in than supply available
from the domestic basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I agree that there's going to be
a good market in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually going to be speaking in
Germany about this in July at a conference
[SPEAKER_01]: in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be interviewing a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking to Alex when
we're over there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might be able to do a little quick
interview during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be delighted to see you in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in addition, I'll be speaking at
the United Nations on May 5th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just miss you in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're talking about cannabis
economics and mainly from an environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability, social equity,
and in a corporate governance perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so there's a lot happening in
the cannabis space these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot happening indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just coming up on time anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to know more about the
economics, there is the website below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd highly recommend everybody brushing up
their skill set and going and checking out
[SPEAKER_00]: the site because it's very informative
indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, mate, and have a
great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pleasure speaking with you
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope to see you in person in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to see you in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
