[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Paul Finnegan, who's a founder and
[SPEAKER_01]: product director at NatureCan.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Paul?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are one of the stars of the show
in the UK CBD world at the moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it was great to talk to the top
companies in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick 60-second overview of how you found
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself at NatureCan and finding out that
you were a partner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my sort of CBD journey started about
five years ago when I first started
[SPEAKER_00]: looking into the product and seeing that
it was looking like it was being legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe in 2018, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went out there, looked at sort of how
we were going to set up a supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that was going to be a little
bit future-proofed on the THC side because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a bit high over in the US at the
time, the sort of limits and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, still it still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set up a supply agreement over in
Oregon, over in the States, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: luckily met Andy Duckworth, who's my
partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the CEO of MyProtein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he built that business to, you know,
350 million turnover, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fully globalized in all the different
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he jumped on board and we managed to
get into, first of all, the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: then set something up in Germany,
Ireland, expanded into a few more spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually now we're at sort of 45
countries trading CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an incredible old story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've had your hair pulled out
dealing with the Irish last time you got
[SPEAKER_01]: over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't talk too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, we operated in Ireland
from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it was, you know,
a little bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were having issues with,
I think there was a big sort of raid a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago on one of the big high street
stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that made us concentrate our mind on
making sure that every bit of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products were sort of to those
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one thing that we did from
the start where that was always the worry
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you're dealing with controlled
drugs, like the THC element of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that and if you want to deal in all the
different countries, the best way is to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've always developed the product to
keep removing, keep getting lower LOQs on
[SPEAKER_00]: THC because that's the trip up in every
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you go over that limit,
basically, but Ireland especially very hot
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to vary across Europe as much as
they've got the set standard of zero point
[SPEAKER_01]: zero two or three percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland seems to have no holds barred that
it's zero percent to THC completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The topic I brought John, I want to talk
today about is the kind of supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe answer a couple of questions
on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: First one is basically where do you think
the majority of CBD is sourced from
[SPEAKER_01]: currently available on the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it North America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Eastern Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Central Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you think is the main market for
CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main supply, so the raw ingredient is
from the states, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is obviously some supplies in
Eastern Europe as well that built up over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the length of time that
they've been doing it in the states and
[SPEAKER_00]: the competitive price in the price of the
biomass, a lot of it is coming from North
[SPEAKER_00]: America still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an aside from that, I was over in
Thailand just before Christmas because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously that market's all opened up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pricing over there is extremely
expensive still for raw ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biomass is incredibly expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these extractors have just
invested, you know, five, six million into
[SPEAKER_00]: their facility and trying to recoup some
of those capital expenditure from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's incredibly expensive initially in
these markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as they mature, obviously with scale
and everything else, they start coming
[SPEAKER_00]: down in price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think that the US has still
got a good hold because it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: competitively priced, but the quality is
good as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is extraction to the
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: And who do you think are the best
territory in the world when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: the extraction side of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, because the US have been doing
it for so long and, you know, all
[SPEAKER_00]: extractors are definitely not created
equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to sort of 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very close to our extractors,
you know, work exclusively over with IAH
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got machines that are from
Rotachrome, which is a European business,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they deal in absolute specialist
purification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting, you know, to part per
million of each product or phytochemical,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, when you invest in
those types of machines and extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the very front end with cheap
machinery, you know, you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: being left in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't extract the bits that you want,
never mind the sort of control drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking sort of chlorophyll and lipids and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you've got these machines,
which, you know, the seven figure costs
[SPEAKER_00]: these machines to buy, we've got two of
them in that in that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're extremely precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's where I think it
needs to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then moving now to the UK, just a couple
of questions that I think you might be the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect answer on a scale of one to shit
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: How bad is the novel food process
currently at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what this one is?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the difficult one, because I've
got a caveat at all by saying at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start, this has become so big,
so quickly as an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to police it was always going to be
incredibly difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the way decisions that have been
made would not be what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it should be done at
ingredient level for a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you've got a safe raw ingredient,
then, you know, by putting it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate cookie that's been in the supply
chain for two, three hundred years is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be my first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would say is, you know,
there's so many people that have got into
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, you know, over the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people that are looking at
abusing the system as well, where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were one of the first ones
that got to the next stage on novel foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there was 74 businesses or 92
businesses originally on that first day
[SPEAKER_00]: that got across or actually applications
of which we had nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pressure was put on the FSA
from all sorts of different sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: more sort of documents submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to take them through to the
next stage and then let sort of discount
[SPEAKER_00]: them at the next sort of part of the
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a process which was never
how it was meant to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping it's going to be sorted
soon, but I'm also not holding my breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's a case of because Europe
is so heavily influenced by the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that the synthetic and the
biosynthesized molecules are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that they end up going,
well, we know this site, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: replicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be easier for us to
manage than extracted plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that that does make it
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the problem with it is
consumers don't want that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they want a natural alternative
that really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the vast majority of people
in CBD believe in the entourage effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's the raw plan with, you know,
some of the other minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't actually think consumers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're almost not solving the problem
because that, you know, people still want
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy the sort of natural alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's, you know, one of the
things is that the industry hasn't done
[SPEAKER_00]: itself any favors as well by proving a lot
of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of them are massive
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a global study and it's 25
million, that's, you know, a lot of cash
[SPEAKER_00]: to fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some companies doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it's more at the sort
of big farmer end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing at the moment is studies
at universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sponsor PhD courses and like ProfDoc
courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, we do studies about,
you know, urine buildup, how it works for
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sleep with a blind placebo test
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've got to build up the
evidence as well as an industry to show
[SPEAKER_00]: how safe this product is and how well it
works for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the efficacy and the
clinical trials and proven that statistics
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to outweigh just people's
nuanced opinions on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One or two questions on the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: How realistic is the UK going to have an
adult use cannabis market within the next
[SPEAKER_01]: five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think about five years would be a
sort of timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, we're actually in the
process of buying a pharmacy license and
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into MedCan ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the same in Germany, where we've got
a venture set up over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Germany is getting this
recreational market, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully fully legalized in 12 months in
2024 around then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more that I hear about it and the
more as time goes on, it just makes
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute sense where, you know,
we can, there's tax money to be made out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to be the sort of shit show of the
states as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse, excuse the French, but you know,
the federally illegal, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily taxed per state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't move it into state and
everything else to sort of create proper
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think we'll do it, but I think
we're still sort of five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going to be behind the
Germans and watching what they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Czech Republic as well look like they
might even steal a march on Germany with
[SPEAKER_01]: the coalition of politicians they've got
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke about this yesterday, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to be a really
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a facility, one of our partners
over in the Czech Republic that make
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules for us and incredible business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're looking into,
they do a lot of CBD capsules now as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody like that is well-placed in a
market that's, but that should be the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially after we've Brexited and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be the ones that are growing
this with, you know, CGMP farms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: exporting to all these European countries
and exporting now that we've taken it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what I didn't want to Brexit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say as well,
but, especially to an Irishman,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've got to make the most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if this is what we've done,
then we've got to take the laws into our
[SPEAKER_00]: own hands and look at how we can,
this industry is going to be enormous in
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nevermind how big it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're playing the long game here and it's
just going to get bigger and bigger as
[SPEAKER_00]: more places legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't get a move on,
we'll be left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be an importer instead of an
exporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who, you know, aren't making
the cash out of it are the ones who are
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying the cash to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you would have thought with the
Tories being empowered that they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: business friendly and they facilitated the
GW Farmer R&D that allowed the jazz
[SPEAKER_01]: acquisition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Rishi Siddharth just seems to be
the worst possible person in charge at the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst possible time for the cannabis
industry in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and for me, I think it's a vote
winner with the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, without getting too
political, the donors behind the Tory
[SPEAKER_00]: party and everything else, what's their
sort of interests in allowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sort of, have they got alcohol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they got pharma investments?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these types of things where,
and they're the guys that don't want this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharma guys, the alcohol to be pushed
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems to me that Europe is going
to split into its own model where it'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: social clubs a la Spain that will start to
dominate around Europe and it'll be more
[SPEAKER_01]: non-for-profit organizations as opposed to
profit heavy dispensaries like cookies and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other half of the industry is
going to be applied pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients that are going to be,
pharma companies will take control of a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of molecules and create a range of
medicines from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me there will be a massive
divide between the two sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I always say,
you know, Big Pharma doesn't want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your own medicine, do they?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: McDonald's don't want to give you the
recipe to their Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want you to come in and eat the whole
thing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me this, it's nearly a 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the things you're looking forward
to over the next 12 to 24 months with you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys and all the projects you have working
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, really exciting about MedCan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really this year going to be a big
focus for us in the different territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD expansion into the Far East.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already sort of trading in the Far
East, but that's going to be further and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some other wellness products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just got so much good NPD that
we've worked on over the last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: two years that some have been soft
launched, some into different territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to expand that across
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the big thing with that
is because of the way novel foods worked
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else, it's been a bit
restrictive on NPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas we're going to can't do it in the
UK, but everywhere else is going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: some fantastic products coming this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's great to talk to you,
Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can chat up towards the end
of the year and get an update on all the
[SPEAKER_01]: great things that are going to be
happening with NatureCan and MedCan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, thank you very much for your
time and it's a pleasure to chat to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for having me,
Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check us out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
