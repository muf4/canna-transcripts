[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody to this episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this show
by Jasmine Moore.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the founder and CEO of Green Panther
Chef and a newly formed author as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because her book just got released
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Jasmine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I am amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on the show now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people in Washington, DC would
know about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be the premium cannabis
connoisseur cooking up delights over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that territory, can you maybe give
everybody a little overview on where you
[SPEAKER_01]: came into the industry and how you kind of
started Green Panther Chef?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started Green Panther Chef in 2017,
but I actually started cooking with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis years, probably like a decade
before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had got diagnosed with Crohn's disease
right after I had graduated from culinary
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so through the process, I had dropped
down to around 84 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was put on five medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was told this was supposed to be my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got introduced to a doctor who
introduced me to cannabis and just cooking
[SPEAKER_00]: with plants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 13 years later, I am not on any of
those pharmaceutical medications and I
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively use food and cannabis for
happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've had a great journey to get to
where you are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of some of the kind of events you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys do kind of curated cannabis events?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is some of the best things you guys
have worked on over the last 12 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our book as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we definitely do a lot of private
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of catering and then private
events just for an elite clientele in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can see infused dinner parties
being a huge thing when it comes to Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give the audience a little
overview of the best methods for cooking
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it kind of butter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is hash better than flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be some of the top,
let's say, three tips that you give to the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer who's watching the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know how to create
repeatable results, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to know your numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't have to go into knowing the
percentage of THC or CBD, but just knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to work with your
endocannabinoid system is that one to five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, that five to ten milligrams
and then upward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as well, cannabis is allergic to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to extract and get the
most out of your cannabis is in something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is fat soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oils and butters, coconut oils as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want something that doesn't have
such a drastic smoke point that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to degrade your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the most out of
your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for those extra virgin olive oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for those coconut oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the butters as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the best and something
that's fat soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no vegetable oil or canola oil or
anything like that to extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on now to your recently book
that just got released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give everybody an overview of the
story of creating the book, how you got it
[SPEAKER_01]: out and some of your favorite pieces of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually just launched our pre-sale
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to share the link with your
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's called More Than a Cannabis
Cookbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about two years to do that or to
write it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it demystifies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to bend perspective away from my
sugar retreats, you know, into like a more
[SPEAKER_00]: holistic approach of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of clientele who just want
approachable recipes and they want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: how they can just cook for health and
happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of spurred this book,
More Than a Cannabis Cookbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has cookoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a hundred recipes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's broken into seven parts to target
the certain ailments or the common
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments that people are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gastrointestinal anxiety, insomnia,
migraine, and how you can align like your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, your terpenes and your food so
you can get the most out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can everybody expect to be able to
order that worldwide from what date?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are actually going to be worldwide
December 15th of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we definitely need your support by
clicking that link.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: GreenPanterChef.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can see the link down there to
be able to go and pre-order the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd highly recommend checking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move on to some of the more
talk about edibles in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and nationwide in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you see as kind of some of the
premium brands leading the way in properly
[SPEAKER_01]: curated manufacturing edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some local brands that are
inside of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Fruit Chewy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name is drawn a blank to me right now,
but it has really great quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using plant sustainable products
like they're definitely leading the way
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to like packaging and all of
that good type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is more on the sweet side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like to explore the savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so using like a building after a plant
pantry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the items that we have are
like the honeys, the hot sauces,
[SPEAKER_00]: mayonnaise as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just like use those throughout
the day through like in multiple uses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and just not like one dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gets repetitive and kind of
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we have a Chef Jazz line of
products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming around the corner now soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we do have two, but we are
expanding it all out as a companion with
[SPEAKER_00]: the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you heard it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your favorite recipe out of the
book?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you recommend if somebody was
starting off with their first recipe to
[SPEAKER_01]: cook with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a snack in the afternoon for
watching a movie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a brunch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something with eggs?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you maybe suggest somebody to
dip their toe into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been cooking with this or not even
cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the raw cannabis flour and
I've had so much success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This drink is called Sexy on the Inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has basically using raw cannabis
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of green goodness inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have that at least four times a
week, you know, and I've just had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my other favorite recipes is
our vegan seafood paella.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're using oyster mushrooms in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using a lot of the umami flavor,
the capers, the tomatoes, and it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and dosage is a hugely important part
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Mara Gordon on there last week to
talk about the art of dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important it is and how long does it
take you to kind of get the exact dosage
[SPEAKER_01]: right for the different consumers that are
coming through your doors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dosage does take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took me in my beginning in my
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of trial and error around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to ask yourself,
and we break down this in the book in
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, but ask yourself five questions,
really, and primarily just knowing your
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of your THC, knowing your
carrier fat and the units of measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to lead you in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the book, we actually give you a
table so you can plug and play and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to create those repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really comes down to like knowing
those percentages, the numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really isn't that difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know what to plug and play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I suppose it's about sourcing the
perfect strain of flour, first and
[SPEAKER_01]: foremost for users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a process that you go to if
you're creating a snack?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it isolating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the flour I'm going to use because
it contains this profile of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the flavor is going to be X,
Y and Z out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I am picking or choosing a
strand as well, it's like, what is my
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing when I'm working
with a client, how do I want to feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I always talk about myself when I talk
about because I had a gastrointestinal
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really do look at strains or
cultivars that are higher in beta
[SPEAKER_00]: carotene, you know, and because the reason
being is because that interacts with those
[SPEAKER_00]: gut receptors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for something if I'm dealing with a
little bit more pain management,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's higher in mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need a little bit of boost,
I'll look for something like limonene as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really pay attention to the terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also second is like the THC and
CBD content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think terpenes are becoming a
thing with the cannabis connoisseurs in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market that they're starting to know
their things and want those little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: extra bits of information on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are you going to see the Eastern
Seaward of America shaping up now that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got New York pretty much coming to
market next March?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the anticipation for there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are definitely coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's been a few years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little bit behind the West Coast,
but we are coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are some great
consumption lounges, there's some great
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are talking to politicians to
push forward the legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and I've been asked to speak on a
board just so they can kind of navigate
[SPEAKER_00]: the language around how are we going to
introduce cannabis to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal legalization, I'm not going to
give a date on that, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people who need to be in the room are
finally starting to discuss it and being
[SPEAKER_00]: taken seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see consumption lounge as being
one of the focal points of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody to expect, especially
tourists that are going to America,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, Vegas, these kind of
territories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any reason why people are
willing to pay 10,000, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars for bottle service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they won't pay the exact same thing
for premium broads that was grown in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hills of Nepal or whatever it is they're
going to come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, and a music curation
combined with that environment and that
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere I think could be as big,
if not bigger, than an alcohol field of
[SPEAKER_01]: bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to take education as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just being more than a cannabis
cook, being more than just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard so we can break stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more of acceptance and,
you know, and just opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just have to learn a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's slowly marching on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll end up happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tilt it to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me the top three songs that you
listen to when you're in the kitchen
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this artist named Alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love a little bit of reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love my top 40, like in the EDM as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love pop music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw a little bit of Beyonce in there,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I love like a little bit of EDM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's those two worlds seem
to marry together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well, the cannabis industry and the
music industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there'll be so much more to cover
in those two aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I highly recommend everybody
checking out the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to the GreenPantherChef.com
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chef Charles, I hope we can talk again in
the near future and we'll see how the book
[SPEAKER_01]: has gone down.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I will share the link,
but you will see a big banner on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of Green Panther Chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just smash that button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get all the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommended to be cooking away in
your own kitchen in no time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chef Charles for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for watching,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
