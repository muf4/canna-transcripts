[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by fellow Irish man and one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: successful Irish man to ever set foot in
the cannabis industry to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is basically the president and founder
of multi-jurisdictional vertically
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated family of cannabis businesses
that are involved in cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also established Patients Care
Collective in Berkeley in 2001,
[SPEAKER_00]: making it the oldest continuously
operating cannabis retailer in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a wealth of multitude of
experience that we're hopefully going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to drench from in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Martin O'Brien.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for having me on,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was doing the tags, even the name,
I was like, what title I'm giving him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got so many different things that
he's been successful at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to be able to chat here and
hopefully spread a bit of education to the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience watching these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
little overview of how you ended up over
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry in California
going from music into that scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically around 95, sometime around
then 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually they say 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had started a clothing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Communion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first ever clothing company on
the Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was organic hemp back when you couldn't
even wear a full hemp t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to be a mix of cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met this group called the Cannabis
Action Network in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing a booth on the street
every weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: My partner at the time, Mike Mattel,
he met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's an artist and he ended up doing
some art for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we ended up helping with a
concert that they did in Golden Gate
[SPEAKER_01]: Fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ended up helping them with Cannabis Cup
over in Amsterdam for five or six years
[SPEAKER_01]: from like 95 to 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did a lot of activist work for them
basically for the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started doing, because we have
a rave promoter, we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in putting on events and
dealing with cops and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of leads me on to the first
topic I kind of wanted to jump into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got such a long story because we're
only 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and rush different things
along at certain times because I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: could give you three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we cover so many things over a long
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just jump straight on to the PCC,
the success and the longevity of the PCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you start it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the key to the longevity and
success of the PCC and how can people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and Ireland learn from the
successful things that you've implemented
[SPEAKER_00]: over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started PCC because we were empowered
by cannabis and that it's the government's
[SPEAKER_01]: lying to you about it not having any
medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we decided we would go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in April the 4th, 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were, I think some of the stuff that
kept us open is that we were political.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always had some kind of like flyer to
give out to people that they could call
[SPEAKER_01]: their representative or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always took care of patients,
like really took care of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't just in it for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the big things was that we
didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proposition 215, which is what a lot of
dispensaries were based on before the last
[SPEAKER_01]: change in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proposition 215 was 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very gray area type thing in
regards to what you could do, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty clear on a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't have retail and have
dispensary or you can't have a dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: and cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't cultivate ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone that did cultivate and had a
dispensary, pretty soon the DEA would come
[SPEAKER_01]: along and fucking lop your head off.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there were some of the reasons
why like patient centered, political and
[SPEAKER_01]: being aware of the environment and the
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can people in Ireland learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The politicians are not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're self-serving the vast majority of
them, not unless the people of Ireland
[SPEAKER_01]: actually want it and actually forced the
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Writing to your TD or Senator,
coming to one of the PFSA protests,
[SPEAKER_01]: sending an email, joining PFSA,
keeping an eye on the European news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, do you want your mother to have
access to medicine when she gets older and
[SPEAKER_01]: she needs it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or your father?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or someone who gets cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's pretty real.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to Foxworth Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the objective with theirs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the laws allowed you to change
that you can have a separate entity that
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed cultivation and you want to
basically ensure that the patients had
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and a very high quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you'd have to add energy to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like the positivity and the
energy to plant is like whatever you give
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant, plants going to give back to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to make sure that it's not
only grown correctly, but curing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is growing is about half the battle,
curing, getting all the gases out and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to the state where it's like
stable and it's the best medicine you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get is a lot of a lot of people still to
this day, even more now these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: skip that step.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't burn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for the patient,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to be able to control that to
a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not as if PCC, it just carries
Foxworthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got hundreds of products,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a certain amount of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was for PCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also there's a lot of dispensaries
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we started our own distribution
company called California Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm jumping ahead there for you,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason we started that was so we
could distribute our own cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the law has changed, you can't be a
farmer and then sell directly to a
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when to the first of January 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to as a farmer sell to a
distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the retail, we had the farm,
then we started the distribution company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're vertically integrated and we
don't really need like anyone in that
[SPEAKER_01]: regard to get ourselves to a certain
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, one of the things I'm very curious
about is when it comes to the logistics
[SPEAKER_00]: and the shipping of the product from point
A to point B, is there a specific license
[SPEAKER_00]: that the driver is required to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there specific insurance that goes
with the trucks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it basically just if nobody asks,
nobody says?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been shipping weed and moving weed
around California for a long time before
[SPEAKER_01]: it was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like one of my favorite things about
legalization is that you have a shipping
[SPEAKER_01]: manifest, an effing shipping manifest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cop can pull you over and
you're like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going from point A to point B.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a beautiful thing about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to have it's also on a thing
called metric, M-E-T-R-C.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an acronym by the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tracking program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, every gram is tracked
everywhere it goes, whether it's from the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer to the distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A distributor can sell to a distributor
and then what's called the final mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The final mile is like from the
distributor to the retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of that's insured.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can insure your product these days,
even though it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your vehicle's insured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's more, everything's more
expensive for your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it is these days anyway,
you know, because it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be legal at a state level,
but it's still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So insurance and all of those type of
things, they sting you pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a highly valued commodity as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a number of untoward
characters who have their eye on that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So security detail in licensing and
insurance are all required to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: ship from point A to point B, including
the final mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I want to jump onto the main
topic that I wanted to bring you on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically patience for safe
access in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been instrumental in the
founding and the energy behind this
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, the non-for-profit
organization in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about the
group that set it up and what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary objective within the next 18
months for PFSA?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself, Kenny Tynan, Alicia Maher and
Martin Condon started Patients for Safe
[SPEAKER_01]: Access a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met on Zoom for a long time through
COVID, started the organization,
[SPEAKER_01]: filed for the non-profit, got the bank
account and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were planning an online conference for
a while, but then COVID opened up,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we ended up aiming to do our first
conference there, and that was in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal of the first conference was to
unite the disparate groups, cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: activist groups around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the main goals,
to get all of these people into the
[SPEAKER_01]: same...
[SPEAKER_01]: My chicken's outside, Rooster.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal was to get all these people into
one room so we could all see we're on the
[SPEAKER_01]: same page and unified, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they used... Nowadays,
CRAN, Major Group for a Farm, Tom Curran,
[SPEAKER_01]: Amy Brown, Peter Reynolds, all these
people now are a larger part of Patients
[SPEAKER_01]: for Safe Access.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a weekly meeting every week,
and it's a larger group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking on larger things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was it started?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen cannabis help a lot of people on
the way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no cure for stage four cancer,
let's be real, but it can give a person a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of dignity on the way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a key thing that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If used properly, it can help to stave off
cancer and be held efficient in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it cure cancer time and time
again, obviously not stage four.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother died of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's why I'm a little more
connected to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends have died of cancer,
my dogs have died of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck cancer, man, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis really, really helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen it first hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone, come along, challenge me,
see what you can... Nah, I've seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: first hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the man with the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the person with the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the politicians in Ireland,
not to see that... We need to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians in Ireland see that that's a
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: A reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the people of Ireland need to
have access to safe medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just for the three conditions they
have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one is draconian, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: MS, they're saying that you can... If you
have MS, we recognize you're sick,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's only if you're really,
really, really sick and about to die that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get cancer, that you can get
access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's draconian.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor's number one rule is do no
harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's Stephen Donnelly in all of this,
except for denying it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an old Ireland and there's a new
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to appeal to both Irlands,
because the new Ireland wants it as a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the old Ireland don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're afraid of priests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're afraid of their doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be real about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's our timeline in the next 18
months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize medical cannabis in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add more conditions, chronic pain,
endometriosis, psychological things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot it can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bring in industry in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would challenge that... You look at my
fridge now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Barry's tea in my cupboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Kerrygold in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bottle of tea in Irish stuff
that Irish people and other people buy
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's way more Kerrygold sold around the
world than there is in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't Irish people have the right to
grow cannabis, to have an industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a distributor, to be a retailer,
to be a manufacturer, to be a cultivator?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just provide for the general
public in Ireland, but also like Germany's
[SPEAKER_01]: got a problem right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have enough access to cannabis,
to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I couldn't... It's very empowering,
I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically getting chronic pain,
neuropathic pain, number of conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: added to the end cap and bolstering and
allowed a much deeper world of patients to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to access these medicines and much
wider range of pharmacies and doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, I think, we're all on
the same ball, regardless of what company
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in or what church you're in in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the objective for us all
now to get going over the next 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely amazing talking to
you, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll have to do a part two and a
part three, which is where we can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would need to say one more thing,
if I could, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctors, that's the blockage,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like right to your TD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you listening to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right to your TD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call your TD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit your TD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them you want the end cap program.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's under review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minister Donnelly was brought up by two
politicians a couple of days ago on the
[SPEAKER_01]: dial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he answered that it's under review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put pressure on your government to change
the end cap program, to allow cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: access for chronic pain and for
endometriosis and other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the first steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's tied in on a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, if you're a person that
wants to change your sexuality in Ireland,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a 10-year waiting list.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland's health system is down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's draconian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be a third world country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things need to change in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be just consultants which you
wait years and years and years to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors have got to be able to general
GPs, like in Denmark and in America,
[SPEAKER_01]: have got to be able to have the right to
prescribe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see your doctor, talk to your
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them what you believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to empower, take our empowerment
and spread our empowerment to our
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians and our doctors and our health
officials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mate, absolutely brilliantly said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking time on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll definitely be doing a part two and
being able to bring more information to
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, mate, you have a great
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to chatting to you
again very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much for having me on,
Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks very much for doing the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
