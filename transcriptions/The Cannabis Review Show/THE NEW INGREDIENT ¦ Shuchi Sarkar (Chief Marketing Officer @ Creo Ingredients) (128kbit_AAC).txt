[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everybody, to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking all things
synthetic this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm delighted to be joined on this
episode by Suchi Sarkar, who is the chief
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing officer at Creo, one of the
biggest companies in the world in this
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Suchi?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to chat with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through all my research, I've come
across the Creo seem to be one of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: players in the game in this new,
exciting industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview on your background?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a lot of success in business so
far today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What drew you into Creo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've been in tech all my
life, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was looking at the next chapter
of my life, I wanted to do something
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different after having worked
for a series of large companies in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tech space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was looking for something
that, you know, was really creating
[SPEAKER_01]: something from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a new industry where there was true
innovation disruption, I was looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunity of building something that
is purpose driven, that I feel could
[SPEAKER_01]: really help the planet, help humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Creo, I kind of found this
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in biotech, something I had never
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The technology is truly disruptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel the benefits of, you know,
of this technology can help every
[SPEAKER_01]: household in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I joined it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very exciting new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you actually look at it from a
global kind of perspective and take the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flower out of the whole game,
the new ingredient is going to be the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of huge component of this factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the capital markets will
put their money, because politicians will
[SPEAKER_00]: back it and science will be able to prove
that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of the new ingredient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see this being a multidiscipline
disruptor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see it going across makeup and
beauty, health and wellness, food and
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to have that much of a big
reach?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that the beauty of,
you know, CBG and many of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients, especially CBG, which is the
mother cannabinoid, is the extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: versatility in terms of the benefits and
the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So primary research indicates that,
you know, CBG has lots of benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only in terms of, you know,
skin care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's already, you know, called the
cannabinoid, but also, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: other industries like, you know,
health and wellness, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you a calming experience,
helping you with in in foods and beverages
[SPEAKER_01]: and nutrition in, you know, pet food or
pet treats applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think because of the properties of
this ingredient, you know, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: related to either anti inflammation or
and, you know, the rich moisturizing
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities, the oxidation properties and
many other things that we are discovering
[SPEAKER_01]: every day literally as more and more
research is coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be here to stay for the
next, you know, whatever you can predict
[SPEAKER_01]: the next decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we've I've already talked to
Ilan Sobel, who's the CEO of Bio Harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: over in Israel, and they managed to create
glandular trichomes from a bioreactor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a first for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, another potential ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a couple of IP processes
through the process of yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also researched there's algae and
a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the IP process has been
saturated so far in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is there still so much room for growth
that you see a couple of other operators
[SPEAKER_00]: entering into the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't use yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use another bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that one of the advantages
that Creo really has is that because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, we have a very what we call freedom
to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our technology is slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our IP is slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: From many of our competitors for the
reason that we don't use yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think this market is going to attract
more and more players and investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you look at the larger picture
around what is happening in bio
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing and vertical farming and
everybody trying to do things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: that are more sustainable, that are more
protecting nature, that are more pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will find that more and more people
will get attracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some stage, I'm sure there'll be
consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be, you know, it'll go through
that whole maturity phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think at this phase, we are where
more and more people are going to come in
[SPEAKER_01]: and get attracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the possibilities for blends
and formulations of the multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic molecules is gonna it's almost
like a chef's recipe now at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many types of bread can be made from
flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in the next few years,
you're going to see a lot of combinations,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people combining different kinds
of cannabinoids, people combining
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of compounds with
cannabinoids, other ingredients with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see such a fusion, you know,
I don't know, tomorrow you could think of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fish oil with cannabinoids or
something else with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a lot of fusion,
a lot of customization and
[SPEAKER_01]: personalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, more and more consumers
are wanting things that are customized for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, variants and different
kinds of new innovations and formulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to happen in the next few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want some few big brands to
take that leap of faith and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: start investing more in the research side
of this category as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's all ready to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're only at the starting stones
of what will actually be the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: generator of capital in coming from the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move on to the next topic and
it's something you're an expert on and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern day marketing for firms in this
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find it restrictive or are there
specific innovative ways that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: bring your brand to market that don't
cross over any of the, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: online digital rules that are happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think for us, because we don't
specifically do THC, it's been a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an exercise, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when we started advertising,
you know, whatever it was, all the social
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms and channels were not very open
to us doing any kind of content or paid
[SPEAKER_01]: especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was able to leverage my contacts
from my previous roles and actually meet
[SPEAKER_01]: with these digital platforms and
communicate to them how our process is
[SPEAKER_01]: very different and that our products are
pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of which we were able to
actually get a lot of these brands to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow our content and our marketing to run
on their platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there are ways, you know,
to do this in a cost effective manner to
[SPEAKER_01]: both not only educate your prospective
buyers as well as end consumers on exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what these products are, what they're
going to do, but also use other ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to use your digital and social and
search, but the other ways are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, webcasts and podcasts and,
you know, participating in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: events where your consumers are going to
be industry specific events.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use other modern marketing
tools like, you know, using syndication of
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think today, any customer before making
any kind of decision, especially in B2B,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to visit and look at a lot more
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, each of these in the modern
day customer journey and content journey
[SPEAKER_01]: has a place, be it your social digital
search, content syndication, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: webcasts, podcasts, being in the right
events and really producing engaging
[SPEAKER_01]: content and putting it where your customer
is and would be ready to consume this
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's definitely a lack of
companies with innovative content
[SPEAKER_00]: campaigns out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be all just crying wolf over
the lack of Instagram and Facebook aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing them to put their stuff on board
for it is a number of different ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: market your product in this modern day and
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: This even, for example, I started this a
year ago just with a curiosity to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: the business side of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the media side of things I
think is very overloaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, LinkedIn is pretty open in terms
of what you're allowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you have webinars,
you have, you know, link to all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: trade media, as well as all the big shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a big digital footprint as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have email marketing,
which, of course, because of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: privacy rules, you have to be really smart
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be really smart about doing it
and making sure that you are optimizing
[SPEAKER_01]: keywords and subject matters and things
that people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you invest in those things and make
your content searchable and make your
[SPEAKER_01]: content engaging, you can't bore a
customer into reading what you want or
[SPEAKER_01]: into watching what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do create content that is
compelling and meeting their needs and is
[SPEAKER_01]: really mapped to the customer journey,
I think you can you can do a lot in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the world is not only about
Facebook and Instagram as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: marketers might want to believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the easy option for
them to be able to sell to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas a bit of legwork and a bit of
elbow grease will get you a lot further
[SPEAKER_00]: than a couple of hundred euro on an ad
campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to touch on is a
strong strategy and a clear vision in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, specifically the jewelry and the
kind of biotech synthetic industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's of paramount importance,
I would assume, to be able to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual ingredient before brands start
getting created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the cannabis industry,
it might be more brand focused and brand
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be the strong strategy and
clear vision for that industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there a different way that you
recommend companies in that territory set
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that there is a dual role
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is a role to educate the
customer and, you know, really build
[SPEAKER_01]: thought leadership and awareness and then
the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think whatever you're trying to do,
you need to be very clear on how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to achieve both these two purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not necessarily mutually
exclusive, but you need to have a clear
[SPEAKER_01]: vision of where you're trying to where the
category is going, where the brand is
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly are you trying to achieve for
us personally in Creo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vision really is to bring cannabinoids
to every household, partner with our
[SPEAKER_01]: customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are an enabler to help our customers
create new and innovative products that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can bring to market across different
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, how we do that while we're
still protecting the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we do that in a manner that is
credible, that is something that our
[SPEAKER_01]: customers can rely on for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one huge task of making our vision
and our brand pillars communicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, how do you build
thought leadership in this category?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you really grow this nascent
category?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I talk to people about
cannabinoids, all they think is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a whole exercise of telling
them this is not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, the plant has so many
different other compounds that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having that, you know,
having your strategy and your vision clear
[SPEAKER_01]: of what you're wanting to achieve,
but recognizing that this is an emerging
[SPEAKER_01]: and nascent technology, which is also
stigmatized to a certain extent and
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing all those barriers in a manner
that you can really achieve your goals is
[SPEAKER_01]: really important, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I couldn't agree to more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely brilliant talking to
you, Shuji.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could actually talk to you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the 15 minute time limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody wants to know more about
Creo, the website is down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see it down on YouTube and
Spotify and all the places that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to join us on this episode, Shuji.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we get to touch base again
in the future and catch up on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: great things Creo might have accomplished
by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Owen, for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, any of your speakers,
they're welcome to reach out to us anytime
[SPEAKER_01]: if they want to learn more either about
the category of Creo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you again for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to talk to you and be highlighting
such a great new forward thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until the next episode, guys,
we'll chat to you soon.
See you next time.
