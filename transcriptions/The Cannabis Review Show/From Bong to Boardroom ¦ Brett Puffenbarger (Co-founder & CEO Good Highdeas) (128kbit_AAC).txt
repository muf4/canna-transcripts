[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Brett Puppenbarger,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is the co-founder and CEO of Good
Ideas over in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all right, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Busy day, but can't complain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Busy is always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks very much for taking your time
out to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might give everybody a quick overview
of how you got from Bong to Borek.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your journey into the cannabis
industry quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't really discover cannabis until
I was in my mid 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm a veteran of the United
States Marine Corps and I came to it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a little while,
I realized that it could also be a career
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity because I'm a big believer in
you never work a day in your life if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do something you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just became a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a marketing and public relations guy by
trade before the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, military owned a couple of
karate schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was a director of business
development at Harley-Davidson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, there's a lot more
similarities to working at Harley and
[SPEAKER_00]: working in cannabis than most people would
believe, because it's a lifestyle first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a product category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I try to treat it and look
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've got it right in the nail in
the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis is going to fit right
into some of the normal industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be food and beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be lifestyle, as you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the current industry is going
to be able to adapt cannabis into their
[SPEAKER_01]: current strategy and profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I want to talk to you
about is consulting and advising in an
[SPEAKER_01]: ever changing landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty myriad of rules and on top all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just in the States or Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody's dealing with a
changing list of rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it like over in the States?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any more clarity towards federal
legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you guys go about advising your
clients state by state and product by
[SPEAKER_01]: product?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's 38 different cannabis
industries in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus there's probably double that in
different countries who have some level of
[SPEAKER_00]: framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually working with clients in
a couple of different countries right now
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that I think is kind of
important to note is that consulting and
[SPEAKER_00]: advising are actually different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people kind of put them
together and we try to differentiate them,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So consulting is going in and getting
inside of the company and working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals within the company to develop
plans and strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas advising is kind of being an
outside observer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being there as a resource for advice
or to offer direction but not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: being involved in the day-to-day
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've found is that advisory
services are actually more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as a consultant or an advisor,
at least in my belief is, is that my goal
[SPEAKER_00]: should be to make myself obsolete sooner
rather than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to teach you the skills to do what
you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something we do that's kind of unique
at Good Ideas is we like to empower the
[SPEAKER_00]: internal team members to do the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be there as a safety net.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be there as a helping hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be there as the person who can help
you kind of navigate the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want you to be the one to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at it more of a, I guess you would
call it a mentoring relationship though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very reticent to call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my big focus these days is if you look
at my resume, I look like any other
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate cannabis guy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you look at me as a person,
I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look very much more like a legacy
cannabis guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is to blend those two worlds
together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking bridging the gap to bomb
the boardroom, I mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean it in that order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to help the small legacy
operators, the medium sized companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who are intrinsic to the
culture, compete with the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those aren't the same thing as
much as people would like to believe they
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have you guys found, have you got
clients across the whole state and are the
[SPEAKER_01]: different rules sets and advice and let's
say consulting at the points of rule that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd use different depending on the East
or West Coast or is there a kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: synergistic strategy that you use across
the whole of the North America?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of it could be broad
strokes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A big chunk of it is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're getting into cultivation or
extraction or things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are going to work the same way no
matter where you are at geographically,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's going to grow the same no
matter where you're at minus some
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in climate and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And little things, but a plant is a plant,
a machine is a machine, a product is a
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the marketing,
public relations, business development,
[SPEAKER_00]: those things, each state has its own
approach because each state has its own
[SPEAKER_00]: license structure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would suggest a company do in
California is very different than what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would suggest a company do in Florida
because particularly because we do
[SPEAKER_00]: business to business stuff and a lot of
our clients are primarily business to
[SPEAKER_00]: business clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those strategies going to change when
federal legalization happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in that little group of people who are
kind of like Chicken Little right now who
[SPEAKER_00]: are going, you guys do realize that
federal legalization changes the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the big players now will not be
the big players then because their
[SPEAKER_00]: business model isn't set up that way,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the large multi-state
operations, if you look at the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: operate, they operate in primarily East
Coast states with limited license
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, regulatory capture,
forced vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the West Coast states,
I think they're better prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legalization because what's going
to happen is traditional unit economics,
[SPEAKER_00]: producer and consumer states.
[SPEAKER_00]: The places where cannabis grows well
naturally are going to do better at
[SPEAKER_00]: producing products than the places that
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this in almost every other
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't mind the steam seal the
same place you smelt it into a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't harvest the stuff and then put
it into a factory right next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it gets moved as a raw product and
then it gets processed and then it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to completely upend
the cannabis industry at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And truth be told, the thing I'm most
excited about is the public relations
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising marketing side of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had to come up with some very unique
and interesting ways to approach those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to be able to do what
everybody else does, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like run Google ads, run TV
advertisements, run anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think will be huge because right now
it's a game of attention and there's very
[SPEAKER_00]: few ways that other industries have to
gain attention that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've kind of had to make up our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest with you, I'm really
tired of retrofitting things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of reinventing the wheel every
time we need to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be fun to watch us
kind of grow because we started as this
[SPEAKER_00]: like post prohibition industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've kind of grown into what we
think is an adult functioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrant industry worth billions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still kind of a toddler,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still kind of a little kid and we
need to start growing through these
[SPEAKER_00]: phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really excited for the next
couple of phases of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: older childhood, the teenage years of the
cannabis industry and then eventually get
[SPEAKER_00]: to what we all hope it's going to be where
people can go to college and get a degree
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, where it's no different than
saying, mommy and daddy, I want to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyer or a doctor or I want to work in
space or I want to work in this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're that's way off,
but we're taking the steps to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next topic I wanted to kind of jump on
to this, I know you could run something
[SPEAKER_01]: around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've just mentioned there were right
where young kids were only grown up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a little teenager, even at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So corruption in cannabis, we're seeing a
lot of headlines of CEOs, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Canadian companies taking obnoxious
annual salaries and looked like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: almost killed from the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you tell us about corruption
cannabis that you guys are working on your
[SPEAKER_01]: Project Mongoose operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Project Mongoose, in short, is the ability
to give someone else a platform or to use
[SPEAKER_00]: our platform to kind of talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I experienced in the early
days of my cannabis career is that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of suck to work in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can kind of be difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all bong rips and high fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of pivots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you've been in cannabis for a
little bit, you kind of realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on an island, that most of your
friends also work in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're your peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work at this company or that company
or they work in a different state than you
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something I realized in just my day to
day conversation is that we were all
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing a lot of the same problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter what state or country we
were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter what industry segment we
were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something we really wanted to do is
provide that platform for people to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this traditional water cooler talk in
public because we really want to effect
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to make the industry
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't hide this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't act like it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't turn a blind eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to address it head on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to talk about it openly and
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to drive for accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And truth be told, if people really want
to understand what's going on in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to understand a simple equation
that we use in the public relations world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that image plus identity
equals reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a little more complicated than
it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But image is what other people say about
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And identity is what you say about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your reputation is the combination of
the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have in cannabis is a whole bunch
of companies with amazing identities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at nothing but their press
releases, their website, their marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, they look like the greatest company
in the history of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can point at a whole bunch of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at their image,
they have awful glass door reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have terrible customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a simple Google search of a lot
of the major MSOs with a basic term like
[SPEAKER_00]: scandal, lawsuit, corruption, union.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start pairing those up,
you see a very different story than their
[SPEAKER_00]: identity tells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem that needs to be
addressed because it's not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian CEOs pilfering the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the American MSO executives
and their spouses getting popped for
[SPEAKER_00]: corruption charges or getting sued out the
wazoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all of that at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not what we need as an
industry to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, it's hampering our ability to
grow up in a lot of ways because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: here doing exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pilfering the companies or they're
living off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And truth be told, I think it's actually
one of the most condemning pieces toward
[SPEAKER_00]: our future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the large cannabis
companies, whether they're US or Canada or
[SPEAKER_00]: even some of the European ones,
all of them kind of have this idea or they
[SPEAKER_00]: at least position themselves as thinking
we're going to get bought out by the big
[SPEAKER_00]: boys, the proctoring gambles, the Johnson
and Johnson's, the Coca Colas of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to buy us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they are anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would they?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are scandal ridden, losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing any of the things they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those companies like the big
guys are looking at that and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: playing a much longer game plan than the
company like the major cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_00]: realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because we're corrupt and we're
broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see it in the pay packages and all of
the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as I said, we've only got a short
show that we do for each of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could talk all day and continue
on, but we'll definitely have to catch up
[SPEAKER_01]: at a further date to do part two and see
how Project Mungus is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Brett, thank you very much for coming
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody wants to check out good ideas,
I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The website is there below.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode will be up very shortly and
we'll chat you on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it easy.
