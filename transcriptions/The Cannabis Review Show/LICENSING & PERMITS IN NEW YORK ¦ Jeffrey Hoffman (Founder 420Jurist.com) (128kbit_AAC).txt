[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Jeffrey Hoffman who's the founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: 420 Jurist and a leading lawyer based in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you keeping today, Jeffrey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing outstanding, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking at a lot of your segment
live streams on LinkedIn and doing my
[SPEAKER_01]: research and you seem to be a man who's
going to be able to bestow some knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: on the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick little overview of what's happening
on the internet?
[SPEAKER_01]: A quick overview of how you came from
graduating law school to opening up 420
[SPEAKER_01]: Jurist and your space in the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a twisted journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in law school here in the United
States in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you that remember that
time, that was also when the internet was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually started my career in tech,
started a web development studio,
[SPEAKER_00]: was in a couple of sustainability startups
that use technology, was always doing law
[SPEAKER_00]: in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those entities, I was a
general counsel or otherwise was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: other some legal things.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis legalization really started
rolling here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: California started doing medical in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally in the early 2010,
specifically 2012, Colorado and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were kind of hoping New York would as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started screaming very loudly about
we got to legalize, we got to expunge
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's records.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get all the nonviolent cannabis
offenders out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for various and sundry reasons,
New York did not get around to legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: until 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once New York did that,
this really became what I started doing
[SPEAKER_00]: full time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping that the delay with New
York is an ability for them to learn some
[SPEAKER_01]: lessons from the mistakes that have been
made in other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully that's the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: First topic I wanted to talk to you about
was your Ask Me Anything live stream on
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's become very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that set up basically just as a way to
help bestow information on, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: young entrepreneurs who might not have
access to a lawyer of your caliber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just those individuals,
but frankly to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a big believer that information
deserves to be known, that we in the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: profession and people in other professions
do a disservice to the community writ
[SPEAKER_00]: large if they don't share information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that everyone has to take
on every client or do everything they
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can in 24 hours in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is important to me that information
gets out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's information about what's
going on both in the state as far as the
[SPEAKER_00]: progression of legalization, as well as
the expungement information and the
[SPEAKER_00]: justice information, which I mentioned
briefly before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, I just started doing it because
I'm a longtime fan of the website Reddit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is the website that really
brought the concept of an Ask Me Anything
[SPEAKER_00]: to the public consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on Reddit, then experts in all
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, these days, people perhaps
aren't experts, but anyone that wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up on Reddit and do an Ask Me
Anything can do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then very similarly to what you're
doing with me today, LinkedIn started
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling out their video feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stream Yard is one of what you're using is
one of the ways you can connect to
[SPEAKER_00]: LinkedIn and stream video for any type of
presentation or discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, hey, nobody seems to be
talking about this in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take the Ask Me Anything from
Reddit and use the technology which
[SPEAKER_00]: LinkedIn now has to do live videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's do that every week at 420 on
Wednesday, obviously, 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows why that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just here in the United States,
and I'm sure most other places,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday is the day that most people are
at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday and Friday are the days you might
take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started doing it Wednesday at 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's been absolutely brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any young entrepreneur looking to get
into the industry, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: watching along the sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll learn an absolute good amount of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing I wanted to talk about was
basically your own practice 420 jurist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that strategically set up with a
specific aim in mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know you specialize in licensing
and permitting and strategy negotiations
[SPEAKER_01]: and contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did this just all flow organically or did
the 420 jurist name come from somewhere in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I needed something that the URL
was available for, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in the United States in
particular, and I guess worldwide now,
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 is just the code for cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it dates back well into last
century, and it's funny to say that these
[SPEAKER_00]: days, where this term, 420, 420 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day, 420, April, we in the
United States do month and month and then
[SPEAKER_00]: day, so April 20th is 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another day that has pretty big
significance in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, that was some nomenclature
that made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, usually the word lawyer or
attorney is taken if you want to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: a domain name, but jurist, which has the
same root as juror.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a juror is a person that sits on a
trial and makes a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: A jurist can either be an attorney or a
judge or a person that works in the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: profession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 420 jurists just made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it flows off the tongue,
mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, it's all about that domain
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get that catchy, easy domain as
half the aim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me this, the licensing and permitting
that you excel at, do you think that the
[SPEAKER_01]: New York authorities have managed to get
licensing and permitting correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we noticed that even from over in
Europe, you can see that one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: states that kind of really set out to do a
social equity program, a lot of the others
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of gave it a little bit of fluff,
but nobody really executed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they delivering on their promise from
what you can see?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it designed properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most regulatory schemes that we have
here in the United States, it is either a
[SPEAKER_00]: license or a permit that the organization
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually quite fascinating to me when
you look at different industries where
[SPEAKER_00]: when the license is the important thing
and when the permit is the important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to work in the mobile vending
industry here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the food carts that you see on
the sidewalks everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that industry, interestingly
enough, it's the permit that's important
[SPEAKER_00]: and the license is something that anybody
can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The permit is the thing that's difficult
to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis industry, it's almost
exclusively licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing at the moment that they're
calling a permit is what is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the labs that confirm there's
nothing wrong with the cannabis that you
[SPEAKER_00]: grew, that the the THC level is what you
say it is, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the licensing, we are right now
getting ready to roll out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, on Thursday of this week,
depending on when you air this today is
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday the 22nd that you and I are
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Thursday the 25th of August,
the state is going to roll out the first
[SPEAKER_00]: retail license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that license will only be available to
individuals that were previously convicted
[SPEAKER_00]: of a cannabis crime in the state of New
York or were arrested for a cannabis crime
[SPEAKER_00]: and then convicted of something else that
came out of that cannabis arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, they also must demonstrate
that they were an owner, at least a 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: owner of a business that was profitable
for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that there's going to be
somewhere around 100 or 150 of those
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses given out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, the state is actually
going to build the dispensaries for those
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state has raised $200 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entity in the state that controls the
real estate portfolio of the state here in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is going to be responsible for
this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no other state has even remotely come
close to some kind of equity program such
[SPEAKER_00]: as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, literally, depending on where the
dispensary is going to be built in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, you're looking at somewhere between
an $800,000 to a $1.5 million asset that
[SPEAKER_00]: the licensed recipient is not going to
have to build themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state is going to build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the licensee will simply rent
that from the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, and some of the other
licenses that we're going to see coming
[SPEAKER_00]: either later this year or early next year,
what I call the nine standard licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is cultivation, processing,
distribution, retail, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be the ability for certain
individuals to apply is what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: calling a social and economic equity
applicant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be minority owned business,
woman owned business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in New York, we have a concept known
as distressed farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be able to apply and also
service disabled veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are members of our armed forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were disabled while they were in
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the state's goal is to give half of
the licenses to individuals that would
[SPEAKER_00]: qualify as social and economic equity
applicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get all kinds of other
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have reduced or waived
licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a loan pool from which
they'll be able to get low or no interest
[SPEAKER_00]: loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they come to the application process,
they're not going to have to have a right
[SPEAKER_00]: to property.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only going to have to have a plan
for a right to property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to unpack that for you real
quickly, in many other states that have
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized, there's typically been a lag
between when you applied and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually get your license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most of them, you had to have this
right to property when you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you either owned the building
where your business was going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you already had an active lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see people sitting on a
lease for three, six, 12 months,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even more, without being able to open
the business, simply having to hold on to
[SPEAKER_00]: that lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the regulatory authority was waiting
to approve their application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, as you could imagine,
could be tremendously expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are just really fascinating
benefits that the state is going to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: to these social and economic equity
applicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you include this first license
that's only going to convicted
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, all of the things that I just
mentioned, there's no state here in the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: that has even remotely come close to what
New York has proposed and is proceeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really is amazing to see the more
people I talked to from New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more kind of positive news you see
that they seem to be doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, it might have been a case
that the delay that New York did has
[SPEAKER_01]: actually been beneficial that they've been
able to structure this property and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're humans and humans are really good at
doing two things, blowing up bubbles and
[SPEAKER_00]: making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be what we are really good
at as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are going to be problems as
New Yorkers as New York sets up its
[SPEAKER_00]: program, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be mistakes and
frankly, they're going to be very big
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think you should be judged on how
you address those mistakes once they get
[SPEAKER_00]: identified, not whether or not they
happen, because I assure you they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, New York has done a reasonably
good job of addressing problems when they
[SPEAKER_00]: have come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we've only given out two
conditional licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a conditional cultivation and
the conditional processing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went to people that were already
in the state's hemp program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This application that we're about to open
later this week is going to be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: one where we're letting people into the
program that have not been part of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with the state, either hemp or
cannabis previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rubber is really going to meet the
road with this first application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, as I mentioned,
when we get to the nine standard licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are called for in the law,
which legalize cannabis, my hope is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they start rolling out those applications
either very late this year or probably
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely in the first quarter of next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look, there are going to be problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be hiccups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we will be judged is how we get
over those hiccups and mistakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we address them and how we roll out
the program as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one last thing before you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were over in New York just in May there
and there was the trucks were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis trucks that have recently
been pounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a case of the license and the
permit did not match for what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was that just a concerted effort to
clean up the, let's say, the retail side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look, I actually just over the
weekend did about four posts on it on
[SPEAKER_00]: LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I previously did, I mentioned I
was very involved in the mobile vending
[SPEAKER_00]: scene here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly what it is related to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this was not an enforcement
action related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may have been a fallout component
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why these trucks were seen
and seized and there have been two
[SPEAKER_00]: incidents of it, one several weeks ago and
one just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one several weeks ago is because the
trucks involved had about two hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars worth of parking tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got two hundred thousand
dollars worth of parking tickets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of excuse me, the city of New
York is going to grab your vehicle and
[SPEAKER_00]: extract that money from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the incident that happened a
couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that happened just now here in
New York City, every region of the city is
[SPEAKER_00]: divided up into what we call business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not every region, but a lot of the
the commercial regions of the city are
[SPEAKER_00]: divided up into what we call business
improvement districts, bids, BIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these business improvement districts
have a lot to do with keeping the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of life and the traffic and all of these
types of things at a nominal level for the
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and the residents that are
within their particular district.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of the trucks that were selling
cannabis here on the streets had the
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember, we said previously
that in the mobile vending, it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: permit that is the critical piece of the
puzzle that literally you can't get in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to buy one on the black
market, it's literally twenty thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars for a two year permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of these trucks had one of those
permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, they were all illegally
vending regardless of what it was they
[SPEAKER_00]: were vending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very easy for the bid to
communicate with the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the police came in and said,
this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was specifically the time square
business improvement district that did
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reached out to the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, let's do an enforcement action
against these folks that don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: required permit to be vending by parking
there at the curb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they seized 19 trucks and
those trucks will be given back to their
[SPEAKER_00]: owners once they come and pay the fine for
vending without the vending permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be my guess that you will see
that enforcement spread to other business
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement districts around the city now
that they've seen this initial one be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really recapture that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the time now and I know you're a
busy man today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to let you go for everybody
wants to check out the services you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffrey, you can check the website link
below to be posted in all the places that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is posted for.
[SPEAKER_01]: For now, Jeffrey, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can touch base in maybe 12
months and see how New York has kicked off
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would advise you to come back maybe in
three to six months, because like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: this first license is going to roll and
we're hoping the first couple of stores
[SPEAKER_00]: get opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've promised before the end of the
year, so late December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think turn of the year would be an
interesting place to check in and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've met the grade there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for your time,
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll chat to you very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh.
