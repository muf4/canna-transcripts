[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of the
cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Deborah Borchardt, who's the co-founder
[SPEAKER_01]: and executive editor at the renowned Green
Marker Report.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Deborah?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm absolutely delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most perfect sources of
information in the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: the Green Marker Report, so I'm delighted
to get the chance to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we maybe start with giving everybody a
little overview of your position in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and how you came to be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background is actually Wall Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked on Wall Street for over 15 years
and had several securities licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I got really burned out on the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I did enjoy
when I was working on Wall Street was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to New York University and
got my master's degree in business and
[SPEAKER_00]: economic reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I went to work at the
street with Jim Cramer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was there, it was really when
we started to see cannabis stocks come to
[SPEAKER_00]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really sketchy back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of companies that would just
put the word marijuana in the title of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company and change the ticker,
make it look like it was this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: company when it really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great news picking, lots of
drama, lots of shady characters,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of stock fraud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started covering cannabis back then,
and then I went out on my own,
[SPEAKER_00]: was freelancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wasn't the places I was working
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really seeing the kind of
coverage that I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt like there was this opening in
the market to have a website that really
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted financial news for the cannabis
industry and really treated it like any
[SPEAKER_00]: other industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the stuff we saw at that time was
really cultural and lifestyle types of
[SPEAKER_00]: publications for cannabis, not so much
business news that was really focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: the financial world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why Straight Green Marker
Report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been online for seven years this
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe we're still online for
seven years just because it's tough in
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a hard place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always like to joke with people
like, I don't know what's harder,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Crane Communications acquired us
in October 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're part of the Crane Communications
family now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been great partners and really
invested in us and really want us to
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed in the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you guys are definitely one of the
most highly revered sources of information
[SPEAKER_01]: in the market, especially when,
as you said, there's an amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation and fibs that get told in
this industry over the last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that North Star, like the Green
Marker Report, has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: advantageous for real entrepreneurs and
business people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual story behind the Green Marker
Report, who was it that co-founded you
[SPEAKER_01]: with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there the first couple of years at
Tuftslog?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the exact trajectory for the Green
Marker Report?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my partners were Cynthia Salaruzada and
Vince Petetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they left the company when we were
acquired by Crane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, our focus has been on
events and digital advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some plans to do some different
types of things, hopefully by the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really feel like there's an opportunity
to present more information on these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas right now, it's kind of broken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking for financial
information on these companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different websites that focus on
different pieces, maybe acquisitions and
[SPEAKER_00]: deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one might focus on something
more like the legal news.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to hopefully try to create
some kind of research center where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: pull all these things together,
just because we feel like it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: fragmented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the comment on the
journalism, because that's really been our
[SPEAKER_00]: North Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main mission is to deliver good
journalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cannabis companies that
would prefer to just have us take the
[SPEAKER_00]: press releases and run with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do a little bit of a deeper dive
into the earnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always go into the filings and see
what's really there, because the earnings
[SPEAKER_00]: announcements themselves tend to be a lot
of very positive spin, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, I think the investors
and people within the industry want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the truth and whether it's good or
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the cornerstones of
your guys' operation is the open source
[SPEAKER_01]: insights and analysis and how important
that is from, as I said, an investor and
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur's point of view to be able to
actually have real and correct
[SPEAKER_01]: information, because we've seen whether
it's product being lab tested and the THC
[SPEAKER_01]: content being inflated or whether it's
financial returns and people basically
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to pump and dump the stock,
even to a degree reports being generated
[SPEAKER_01]: by so-called consultancy companies that
are given these valuations of $50 billion
[SPEAKER_01]: a year for this market and 20 for this
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having you guys provide this open source
insights and analysis is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the core objective from the
outset is to ensure, OK, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide the most up-to-date and correct
information for everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do take a little bit of criticism for
doing this type of work, because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: first started doing this, I was considered
negative and I wasn't an advocate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't consider myself an advocate,
nor do we do advocacy reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just do reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the best people I've met
have been in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been one of my favorite beats to
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, you're still dealing
with an industry that ultimately is
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have a lot of shady characters
still roaming around the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that struck me early on
in my reporting was how many small
[SPEAKER_00]: investors, retail investors that lost
maybe all their savings investing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies because they read
something that they thought was true when
[SPEAKER_00]: it really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really felt for these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing is, is that that investor
that invests five hundred dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand dollars, maybe even ten
thousand dollars, they're just not given
[SPEAKER_00]: the same attention by mainstream media
because they're not they're not big
[SPEAKER_00]: investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are penny stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no one really covers them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that was something that kind of
became my mission was I want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that if companies were ripping people off,
that we expose that so that they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to do this to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a real focus of mine and
something that we get emails all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: from readers saying, I'm so glad you
published that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to work with so and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I see they're not paying their
bills or right now I see that they con
[SPEAKER_00]: people out of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for letting me know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's been something that makes
us feel good about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The investors, especially a lot of them,
if you're a consumer of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in the culture of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very distinct market that if you're
in the culture of cannabis, you want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do see these smaller retail
investors putting in a couple of hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: euro, a couple of thousand euro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be a huge chunk of their
savings and ensuring that those people are
[SPEAKER_01]: protected is is definitely a bonus for
everybody in the industry, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: because nobody wants to burn the small
retail retail investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be fair, there are some companies
that are performing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do highlight those, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also really focus heavily on female
owned companies, you know, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to make sure that the female
executives and female owned companies also
[SPEAKER_00]: get their fair shake in the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not having an equal balance
in any industry is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never enough so the cannabis industry
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be just a select few get to
profit off this industry when the culture
[SPEAKER_01]: is so wide and diverse and touches every
demographic and every nuance of the human
[SPEAKER_01]: race.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on to the next thing I want to talk
about, which is big news for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be that there's these three
big things in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the safe banking act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third one was the Florida
recreational ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard yesterday that this was
successful and that a vote will happen in
[SPEAKER_01]: December.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not mistaken, actually,
November, it'll be in November when we
[SPEAKER_00]: have our big presidential election.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to tell us all about what's
happening in Florida, why there's reason
[SPEAKER_01]: to be positive and what the ramifications
could be for the nationwide industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Florida right now is a medical only
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So medical cannabis is legal in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some some big players like
truly has over 130 stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical market, but they have been wanting
to transition to an adult use legal market
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fully legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've really kind of struggled with
getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time they have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Supreme Court in that state said,
yes, it can go on the ballot for the
[SPEAKER_00]: voters to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caveat, though, is that they have to
get 60 percent of the voters to approve
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pretty big number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This market is anticipated to be a six
billion dollar market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already at one point eight billion
for medical only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three times that puts it about six
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's considered a fairly large
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while people think there are quite a
few stores already compared to Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: and Massachusetts, it's actually
understored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see continued expansion in
that state and maybe even a lot of mergers
[SPEAKER_00]: and acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's there's a lot of focus on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of focus on it,
not just from the business aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the cultural aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a state that's gone heavily into
conservative politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have gone heavily into culture wars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're curious to see what happens
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will these mostly Republican voters
vote for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will it drive more Democratic voters to
the ballot box to vote for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a toss up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one really knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that there's a lot of focus on
this to see what really happens with this
[SPEAKER_00]: vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, in addition to the
presidential vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's it's it's a it's a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's not mention the presidential
vote now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a whole new discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of earnings reports have
been out and are still due.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we seeing the upward trajectory of the
cannabis industry now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know a lot of investors got in
two, three years ago at the highs and
[SPEAKER_01]: those earning or those investments would
be down substantially.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be around plateauing or
getting close to what the original values
[SPEAKER_01]: that people invested are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see what do you think you think is
going to be the biggest catalyst for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis stocks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be schedule three
rescheduled?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be safe banking act?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be positions that,
let's say, North American companies have
[SPEAKER_01]: taken in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the likes of Canopy have seen
their growth happen with Germany's news
[SPEAKER_01]: lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the catalyst that
retail investors could look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will really focus on the
scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving cannabis from a schedule one
drug, which in the United States right now
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it as dangerous as heroin,
which is insane and also makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it bumps down to three, that takes all
of that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens the companies up to better
funding and it also takes away the tax hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've had lately with 280e,
which means they can't take business
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses as a deduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard for them to make a
profit with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safer banking is another piece of
legislation that would basically tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: big banks, hey, you can bank with these
companies and we won't go after you for
[SPEAKER_00]: stealing in an illegal substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looked like it had a lot of promise,
but we're hearing more out of Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: that, again, Republicans are starting to
push back on that safer banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's looking less secure than the
de-scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that we are starting to see
valuations pick back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in a two-year bear market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think between the hope for schedule
three, which seems much more doable than a
[SPEAKER_00]: safer banking, the hopes for that are
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this summer we'll see something
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen a lot of companies really
get their houses in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing out of this earnings
cycle, more companies paying down debt,
[SPEAKER_00]: more companies cutting back on expenses,
really getting their house in order versus
[SPEAKER_00]: just hinging on this whole schedule three
thing, which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to see so that they're
really fixing their balance sheets and
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that they're taking the right
steps to clean up these balance sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a really nice thing to see
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the investment community
is starting to reward those companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting their house in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: One quick last thing before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does schedule three mean that we're going
to see a lot of biotech and pharma money
[SPEAKER_01]: come into drug discovery and development
and actually flesh out a range of products
[SPEAKER_01]: because that surely is the big opportunity
for large corporations is these
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations and the drug discovery and
being able to create these products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are gone through clinical trials and can
be prescribed by a doctor seems to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: big, huge opportunity in the industry for
people who aren't already established.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for sure you'll see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll also see a lot of interest
from beverage companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll see a lot of interest
from big tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big tobacco has been losing customers
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a dissimilar product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a leaf product that gets often rolled
into paper and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their business has been going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had to stay out of it because of
the legal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look at the alcoholic beverage
side of the business in the States where
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has been legalized, alcoholic
beverage sales drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they certainly would be happy to have
that clientele or those sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're going to see a little
bit more on that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the biotech side,
yes, will be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that they kind of got their
sights set more on the psychedelic side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're still continuing to see
advances in cannabis, medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure, in different areas, I think that
the excitement there is not as strong as
[SPEAKER_00]: it once was, which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it will definitely open up that
side of the business for more research and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully more medicinal uses for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been phenomenal talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just at our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who hasn't been checking out
Green Marker Report or isn't subscribed or
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't read their news, I don't know what
you've been doing, but the website is
[SPEAKER_01]: below.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be adding this to your tabs and
checking this daily because it's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: up-to-date, best source of financial
information in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deborah, for now, thank you very much for
taking your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a joy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
