[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Rhys Cohen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhys has delivered a number of consulting
projects for a lot of the Australia's
[SPEAKER_01]: leading cannabis companies at his own
previous consulting agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is now the Senior Corporate
Communications Manager at the Massive Can
[SPEAKER_01]: Group and he also sits on the
non-executive advisory board of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Lambert Initiative for Caterpilloid
Therapeutics at the University of Sydney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the editor-of-large was previously
the editor-of-large of Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia's largest B2B industry magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping, Rhys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grand, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a beautiful afternoon here in
Melbourne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lovely sunny morning here in
Dublin, so glad that our times was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you got to the
[SPEAKER_01]: position you are in the cannabis industry
and maybe your dissertation that you did
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually done a couple, funnily
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got started in cannabis in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my honours thesis in the politics
and economics of cannabis legalisation
[SPEAKER_00]: with a focus on Colorado at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis got legalised in
Australia just a few months after I
[SPEAKER_00]: finished my degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started calling myself a consultant and
built myself a website and went from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a few different incarnations over
the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, I'm on the non-executive
advisory board of the Lambert Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also used to work there for about a year
and a half or two in a sort of project
[SPEAKER_00]: management capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also previously run Fresh Leaf
Analytics, which is Australia's most
[SPEAKER_00]: prominent sort of market intelligence
company for the medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent some time working with Martin at
Cannabis and I was very sad to see him go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, as of a few weeks ago,
I've joined Can Group as their senior
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate communications manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking and writing and working on a
bit of commercial strategy as well is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a complete in-depth knowledge you seem
to have of Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The topics I wanted to talk to you today
about first and foremost was the politics
[SPEAKER_01]: and economics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the politics in Australia,
did you find that the right wing side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the government were against the
legalisation of cannabis and it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: Democrats and the Greens, shall we say,
driving the initiative forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see that as is that the same
template that you see around the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you starting to see the right leaning
parties swing into the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, clearly there's very different
conversations to be had about medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: versus non-medicinal cannabis and the
politics around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So medical cannabis was legalised in
Australia under a Conservative government
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2016, but it had unanimous political
support from every party of every
[SPEAKER_00]: political spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one in Australia who's in politics
disagrees with the legalisation of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's some dispute about how
exactly it should work in practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has comprehensive support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's reflected in the general
population as well, probably around 85,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 per cent of Australians support
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about non-medical
cannabis, popular support is closer to 50
[SPEAKER_00]: per cent of Australians think that
cannabis should be legalised for
[SPEAKER_00]: non-medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, it depends how you ask the
questions in the surveys, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the moment, neither major party
supports any change to cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, like you say, the parties
further to the left, the Greens and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason party and other left wing parties
that support such a move, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardcore libertarians, which we tend to
associate more with the right wing of
[SPEAKER_00]: politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of weird coalition of the
left wing, far left wing politics and
[SPEAKER_00]: hardcore libertarians is something that we
see in many other places around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, Colorado and many US states
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been an unholy marriage of those
political forces that have pushed through
[SPEAKER_00]: non-medical legalisation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not, you know, further cannabis
law reform and Australia is not really a
[SPEAKER_00]: topic, a big topic of conversation,
although we had our federal elections over
[SPEAKER_00]: the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was encouraging and interesting,
at least to see that the legalised
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis party of grassroots movements
with no real sort of resources to put into
[SPEAKER_00]: campaigning managed to get nearly seven
per cent of the Senate vote in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of Queensland and between two and four per
cent of the Senate vote in our other
[SPEAKER_00]: states and territories as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's maybe becoming more of a political
issue, but we'll have to wait and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so seven per cent would have to be a
good chunk of change of voters that would
[SPEAKER_01]: actually go out of their way to give their
number one vote to a party dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically just to cannabis
legalisation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting to me in
particular was that it was Queensland was
[SPEAKER_00]: the standout state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know about Queensland with
regards to cannabis is that about 50 per
[SPEAKER_00]: cent of all of the approvals to prescribe
medicinal cannabis in Australia are
[SPEAKER_00]: currently issued by prescribers based in
Queensland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not quite sure that also
correlates to patients because people get
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribed with prostate lines and that's
becoming more and more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really know where the
patients are, but the prescribers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic networks and the pharmacy networks
that they are that they work within are
[SPEAKER_00]: based in Queensland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something's in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so basically in terms of the medical
industry, you've got, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: 70, 80 per cent favourability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it gets down to recreational,
it seems to be around that 50 per cent
[SPEAKER_01]: mark seems to be the kind of magic number
worldwide, whether it was New Zealand's
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation that they had, it'd be the
same over in Europe to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that number shifting with the
economics that the medical industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: providing for Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they starting to see a little bit of
income come into the government where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, actually, hold on a minute,
we'd like 5x or 8x this kind of revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: for our tax covers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, the medical industry is
growing really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, best estimates suggest that last
year the industry made maybe 200 million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars worth of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year it'll probably at least double.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the money's coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that is what's changing people's
hearts and minds, I'm not so sure about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at popular support for
non-medical legalisation over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has increased a couple of percentage
points every year for many years,
[SPEAKER_00]: which predates medical legalisation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it has more to do with the
reduction in stigma and the normalisation
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: More so than people seeing dollar signs in
their eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is an opportunity here,
there's a commercial opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not easy work and it's not
enormously profitable right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the R&D that needs to be put
into this industry will scare a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies away when you see the kind of
capital, how extensive it is and how
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly the cash burn rate can be in some
of these companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it gets pretty real pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Can Group that I'm now part
of, you know, we've just finished the
[SPEAKER_00]: first stage of a really massive
construction project for our sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically integrated cultivation and
manufacturing facility in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost of that's, I think,
somewhere around 120 million dollars at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've also just earlier this
year launched a full phase three placebo
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled randomised clinical trial to
investigate proprietary CBD capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: product to investigate whether it can help
people with sleep disturbance and which
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously we're trying to get that into
the over-the-counter CBD channel in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you only took those two
expenses, that'd be more than most
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies are prepared to put
into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, there's all the money
that we've spent over the years on staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, R&D, developing new new genetic
lines in our cultivars, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not it's not for the faint of
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I think if you have the
overview of the industry, that's the one
[SPEAKER_01]: place Australia can see the genetics and
the specific seed types that you guys can
[SPEAKER_01]: create and then export all over the world
is going to be the current moneymaker,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, from that territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think I think we get to two
places where I think will play really
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is at the plant end of the spectrum,
like you say, because Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're a we're a banana republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all we do is dig up and send up
and send out coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do primary produce really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, wheat, cotton, rice,
we put as a country a lot of money and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of focus over a lot of years into
improving those sorts of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have this great R&D machinery
that can now be put towards cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really accelerating some progress
there in some really exciting ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one would be at the pointy end
of the clinical end, because we do punch
[SPEAKER_00]: above our way globally in terms of in
terms of clinical trials in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's comparatively quite quick and easy to
conduct clinical trials in Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the US or Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our regulatory standards for
therapeutic goods and for clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research are at a level where,
you know, it's it's it's not like doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial in in like in a country
whom I won't disparage as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we are comparable in terms
of the quality of research that we do with
[SPEAKER_00]: with North America and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next topic I wanted to jump onto is
industry analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know you've got a lot of expertise
in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody, let's say,
two good sources that you think are places
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can see good industry analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we talked just before coming
on, there's a lot of places that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: literally seem to be making up numbers to
tell each other how great this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: could possibly be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas a real financial breakdown
analysis of some of these sectors would
[SPEAKER_01]: not deliver the numbers that some of these
guys are producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess it depends what you mean by
industry analysis and which industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in Australia, for example,
there are very few sources of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: One has been fresh leaf analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other, I would say, in terms of
cannabis coverage would be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do exceptional coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I would say that I'm
conflicted, but I really recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm excited about actually is more
mainstream pharma, the business
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence companies serve starting to
service medicinal cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing that now, like,
you know, companies that have been set up
[SPEAKER_00]: that are monitoring, say, for example,
retail sales of medicines through
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies in Australia for big pharma
companies in order to provide them with
[SPEAKER_00]: insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now also capturing information on
medicinal cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a classic cannabis
thing, right, to assume that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: build a cannabis specific solution for a
problem from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in actual fact, people are doing
this sort of stuff all the time already
[SPEAKER_00]: for other industries, and there's an
opportunity to piggyback off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globally, though, I would say,
you know, MJBiz, obviously, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition Partners have been getting a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the challenge is, you know,
all forecasts are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some forecasts are useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry is still really a,
you know, how long is a piece of string
[SPEAKER_00]: operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try as best I can and avoid
forecasting out any longer term than 12
[SPEAKER_00]: months, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabis industry is almost
like a golf shot at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think you're going to hit the same
shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might look like the exact same shot,
but the chances of you being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: replicate the exact same shot over and
over again are pretty much slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a general piece of advice,
I'd say, like, the sources and the
[SPEAKER_00]: forecasts that I trust the most are the
ones that are the most transparent and the
[SPEAKER_00]: most comprehensive in disclosing their
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can have a wild forecast
that's, you know, adolescent field,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's too conservative or people
think it's too ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so long as you've got your methodology
and you're explicit about it, people can
[SPEAKER_00]: argue with the methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a fine argument to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arguing with the end number is kind of
pointless unless you're actually talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the nuts and bolts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last topic before I let you go,
I just wanted to get a quick little
[SPEAKER_01]: overview of everybody of Australia that
some people who might not know the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and understand it, it's medical
only, no recreational, a couple of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leading companies that you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see Europe being an actual
realistic market for Australian companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we see Little Green Farm up in
Denmark at the moment supplying the German
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we've got all the
Canadian companies supplying the German
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to burst our bubble, but there's
going to be German companies who are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to supply the German industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you see that playing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, we we've got our own
situation here at the moment in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: oversupply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's over 300 products that
are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be prescribed in Australia at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those are imported from overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those are of questionable quality
and compliance standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm really excited about is earlier
this year, the Australian government
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented new rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go into effect in about 12 months
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from June next year, we are going to
require all products that are imported to
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia to be manufactured to the same
quality standards as products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: made here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Australia is a signatory to the to the
international sort of GMP, the PICS
[SPEAKER_00]: convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have mutual recognition
agreements in place with Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any medicinal cannabis product that's made
in Australia is already head and shoulders
[SPEAKER_00]: above any product that's been manufactured
in a GPP facility or in a GMP facility in
[SPEAKER_00]: a non-MRA country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a shot at exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at servicing the international market
will need more than just Germany and
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany's medical market to sustain just
the Australian companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: exporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we see more countries opening up
and markets continue to grow, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: future of the industry is pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Australia is part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're outside of North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Australia, Germany and Israel are
the only meaningful markets for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription, medicinal cannabis access
globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, there's all of the
CBD stuff going on in the UK, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a different kettle of fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be an interesting
couple of years now to see how all the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces fall on the cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you.
