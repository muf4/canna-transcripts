[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Mike Hennessy as the VP of Innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: at the world renowned Wanna Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am absolutely fantastic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody your
little run through between 30 and 60
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds of how you ended up coming into
the cannabis industry and your position at
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanna Brands?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I got involved in the industry in
2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a roommate in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously was consuming cannabis for
personal use back then and found it
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never felt like it should be something
that was illegal, but my roommate had
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy and I was able to realize what
medical benefits it had for him and that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was really able to prevent his seizures
and it really just inspired something in
[SPEAKER_01]: me and catalyzed me to want to get
involved in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I moved out to Colorado in 2012,
got involved in the industry in 2013 and
[SPEAKER_01]: then started working with Wanna Brands
early in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Wanna Brands have become one of the
staple top tier brands in the North
[SPEAKER_00]: American cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to talk to you about,
and I'm sure you're going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information for the audience, is
innovation in edibles at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different things that
I'd like to touch on that are under that
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella of innovation in edibles because
over in Europe, we see a lot of the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you'll see in media is going to
be a synthetic edible that comes from a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug dealer that's done some sort of
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to be able to explain to the
audience how advanced this industry is and
[SPEAKER_00]: what exactly you guys are up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, the technology
involved in making edibles, for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who doesn't understand, what is this
simplified process?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've given to you, what's your way?
[SPEAKER_01]: The simple process in edibles is taking
the plant, generally the flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds, the inflorescence, and
extracting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cannabinoids and terpenes being
lipophilic, you're usually using solvents
[SPEAKER_01]: like butane, CO2 or ethanol to create an
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can purify and post-process
it with distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that extract is then infused into
products like chocolates, gummies,
[SPEAKER_01]: other edible forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's generally taking the plant,
using extraction methods, cleaning it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then introducing it into an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the introduction of it into any
product per se, is there specific
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and equipment that gets used
for, let's say, obviously, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be easy to be done by hand,
but if they're a large company like
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves, is there certain technology
that is given the exact dosage per the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact gummary every single time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what does the manufacturing line look
like at a company of your scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the interesting thing with
cannabis in the United States is how
[SPEAKER_01]: state-by-state specific regulations and
market sizes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, we have multiple different
methodologies on how to do the infusion,
[SPEAKER_01]: from something as small as using lab kits
and measuring devices into things like
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally cook in pots at very
small scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way up to full automated
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the full automated equipment side,
there are API dosing devices that can
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately measure inline dosing for the
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really just depends on the
methodology of cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the product range you guys got is
pretty extensive and some very advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations in your blends and form is,
for example, the new quick product you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys brought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give an example of the
technology behind bringing that product to
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, in the early days,
cannabis edibles really just were extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: of a specific strain or a specific
chemovar of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, we are looking to make more
effect-specific products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that this plant has a
multitude of benefits and a multitude of
[SPEAKER_01]: different effects it can elicit depending
upon that chemovar or chemical variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the formulation of cannabinoids
and terpenes that elicit different
[SPEAKER_01]: effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that people use cannabis for
effects like relieving anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: calming effects, sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our newest formulation called Quick
Calm uses a functional blend of just one
[SPEAKER_01]: milligram of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a very intoxicating dose,
very low dose of THC, but combines that
[SPEAKER_01]: with 10 milligrams of CBD and 10
milligrams of CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also additionally, the formulation is
50 milligrams of L-theanine, normally
[SPEAKER_01]: found in green tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all enhanced with 30 other
botanical terpenes for a calming,
[SPEAKER_01]: relaxing effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all fast acting, so it takes
about five to 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think the future of all our
cannabis products are going to be these
[SPEAKER_01]: highly formative products where instead of
guessing what the strain might feel or
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, we're formulating them so
consumers can rely on the marketing and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, I know this product is going to work
for me for the effect that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that kind of leads me perfectly to the
next topic I want to discuss, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the research and development that happens
in edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mentioned there your own unique
blend and formulation of ingredients that
[SPEAKER_00]: created the Quick Calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see, is this one of the most
innovative parts, the most cutting edge
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the edible industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there big money being pumped into R&D
and the creation of blends and
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations as a unique, IPable component
for any organization?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is and there isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is a little bifurcated in the
way that it's doing R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are a lot of brands that are
sticking towards very simplistic R&D,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is throwing whatever the new hot
cannabinoid is, taking some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: phrasing off of places like Leafly and
spitting that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there are companies like Wona and
others that are actually doing consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: research on the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to understand how these
products make people feel, how the
[SPEAKER_01]: different formulations work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also have a third piece,
which is pharma is getting into this in
[SPEAKER_01]: actually new synthetic cannabinoids that
they're formulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rafael Mishulam and his team in Israel
have started to formulate a variety of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: like molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not found in the plant,
but they are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do activate cannabinoid receptors and
are being formulated for very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments and for effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bit of a different approaches
from very unscientific to very scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the biotechnology companies
that are now able to biosynthesize these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules in large scale batches,
completely clean for size, replicable over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see them take a market share of the
ingredient side of things, let's say from
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant slash fraction model?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on where you're located.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about synthesis of
cannabinoids, there's a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that we've seen growing a lot in
Canada has been fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're utilizing bacteria and yeast to
produce, you actually genetically modify
[SPEAKER_01]: these organisms, add ingredients and in
their metabolic processes are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert raw ingredients and molecules into
cannabinoids because they're genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: modified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing that for things like CBG
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also seen ways to take the actual
biomechanical machinery of trichomes where
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and cannabinoids are made in the
plant and you can isolate those and put
[SPEAKER_01]: them into reactors and these reactors are
able to replicate the environment that
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes would live in and have them
produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's always just synthetic
production in labs where you're taking raw
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbons, synthesizing them with
reagents and producing them in labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these processes end up producing
very pure, very isolated forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take for that process to
work in each market, the working with
[SPEAKER_01]: governments and other institutions to
prove that the method is safe,
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable and producing very pure isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the long term, these will likely be
more environmentally friendly,
[SPEAKER_01]: less cost and providing pure ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do see a path forward for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, right now,
without FDA regulation, I don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be a path forward for
those soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in other markets, particularly in
Europe, I think governments are working to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to regulate, understand these
processes and provide a supply chain for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got to be an interesting few
years ahead for the edibles market,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in Europe and in North America,
to see how both markets evolve and the
[SPEAKER_00]: different ingredients suppliers,
whether they're one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whether we have one company has to have
two different manufacturing outputs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to suit the two different markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the one area that we need to
understand better when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: these isolated products is what Rafael
Machum and Ethan Russo and others have
[SPEAKER_01]: been suggesting is that the idea that
there's an entourage effect that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants produce, that THC alone or CBD
alone are less effective than the two
[SPEAKER_01]: combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or combined with CBG or CBC or other
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we're looking at isolating and
purifying single molecules, we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that there are other components
that likely synergize together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we strip everything apart and have
isolated compounds, we need to be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at how the plants are naturally producing
these compounds and seeing if we can mimic
[SPEAKER_01]: and learn from strains that are known for
pain relief or anxiety relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or benefits for sleep and trying to
replicate those blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get to a pure pharma model where
it's one molecule, one receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: we start to lose some of the benefits of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I do think that a lot of the
future will be driven by these new
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic isolated forms of cannabis,
I think that they also need to be combined
[SPEAKER_01]: in structured ways that are formulated
based off the plant and also shown and
[SPEAKER_01]: tested in research for efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been validating it in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the holy grail is that if
they can isolate the different molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: and as I said, create their own recipe
that is almost replicable to an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but they can repeat it a billion
times over in a safe and conductive
[SPEAKER_00]: manner, maybe the opportunity that's out
there for the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing I want to touch on before
you go is the distribution battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys see distribution in the
States?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's state by state at the moment,
but compared to Canada, what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution like for a large scale brand
such as yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the distribution battle is really
outside of even the industry itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the United States, the fact that
there's no really ability to ship across
[SPEAKER_01]: state lines, with it being federally
illegal still.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is is a patchwork of different
markets that are all regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: differently, utilizing different seed to
sale tracking systems, using different
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution models.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do in one state is very
different than what you can do in another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that there is no real model for
how this works in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be figured out within each
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some markets are, I think, better
regulated, better set up than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about distribution,
I think one of the really big red flags we
[SPEAKER_01]: should be looking at is what's happening
in California, where there are
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution centers that are pushing out
and diverting product into the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a significant portion of
what's being produced in California is
[SPEAKER_01]: going through distribution centers,
being sent to lesser unregulated markets
[SPEAKER_01]: of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work to be done on the
distribution model in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure, unlike Canada that has a more
regulated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were over in New York,
about 10 months ago, there was every
[SPEAKER_00]: California brand under the sun was in all
the illegal dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would wonder with a cross-state
competition or transactions how these are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever see a scenario where,
before federal legalization, let's say two
[SPEAKER_00]: states that cross-border with each other
come to an agreement to come to a deal
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're going to be allowed
cross-border commerce?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: California has actually already floated
that idea of partnering with states like
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is neighboring, also has a legal
regulated system, and setting up their own
[SPEAKER_01]: state-by-state interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen that move forward yet,
and it raises really interesting questions
[SPEAKER_01]: on how the federal government would view
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not see a situation where states like
California and New York set up a system
[SPEAKER_01]: for interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many states in between that
haven't legalized yet, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a hard path forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think the real holy grail that we're
aiming for is federal regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fingers crossed that 2023 is the year
where we get a little bit of gain on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground because, yeah, we've all got our
fingers crossed, and it seems to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: logical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like with things in life, the logical
thing doesn't normally get the most
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, thank you very much for taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we get to chat to you towards
the end of the year, and there's more good
[SPEAKER_00]: news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for anybody who wants to check out
Warner Brands collection, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend going to their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are literally a phenomenal brand and
one of the best product ranges that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, WarnerBrands.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, thank you again for your time,
and until next week, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
