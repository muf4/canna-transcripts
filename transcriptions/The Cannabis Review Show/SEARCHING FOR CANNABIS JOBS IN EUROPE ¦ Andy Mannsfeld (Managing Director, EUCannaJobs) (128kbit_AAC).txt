[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Andy Mansfeld, who's the managing
[SPEAKER_00]: director at EU Cannajobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Andy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing, Owen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just back from Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of why you guys set up EU
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannajobs and your position in the
industry up to date?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, big latchet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started EU Cannajobs because we
noticed a couple of years ago that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: really difficult to find talent in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were working on a separate cannabis
project here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking for staff and just found
it difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up having to go through Indeed
and other places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The talent was spread out all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we tried listing jobs,
also it was not really working finding
[SPEAKER_01]: people that were familiar with cannabis
and just decided that that needed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also knew from back in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are a lot of different types of
cannabis specific or cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: specific jobs platforms there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we decided that that was a good way
to go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just try and help the industry and
help individuals trying to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be an opportune time
that you guys have set up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry growing at the rate it's going to
grow over the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hiring talent is a specialty in any
industry, whether it's cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
when it comes to searching for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys partner up with the
various brands and how do you guys find
[SPEAKER_00]: the employees looking to find these jobs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know, initially for
partnering up with the companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was good old fashioned sales calls,
reaching out to the companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were lucky to find some big
companies and a lot of small companies who
[SPEAKER_01]: are interested in partnering with us early
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, at Mary Jane, we found a
lot more companies that want to join the
[SPEAKER_01]: platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the companies, it was just,
you know, reaching out, explaining what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, almost everyone was
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone said, yeah, we definitely need
something like that, which also helped
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage us to keep pushing forward,
which sometimes it can be when you face
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges, it's always easy to want to
give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of just seeing the vision
and pushing forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding the candidates is, of course,
a little bit more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't just reach out to the
hundreds of companies or reach out to
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates like we do to the hundreds of
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using social media, whether it be
through the internet platform,
[SPEAKER_01]: through LinkedIn, and also going to events
like Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been to several others over the last
year or so to really just reach those
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are at these events since
they're obviously interested in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary Jane, it was interesting to see how
many candidates or potential candidates
[SPEAKER_01]: were like, oh, this is a great idea or I
can work in the canvas industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, of course, they need
workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't come from anywhere from
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very good response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're continuing with just the
social media strategy, trying to reach out
[SPEAKER_01]: and get the word out to those candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could imagine the amount of interest
that there would be from regular people
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanting to get jobs in this industry,
especially if you've got a look for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis already.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the current jobs that are
out at the moment, does it seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and cultivation are kind of at
the forefront of this at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it business development and
advertising?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you seeing as the most popular
jobs currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the industry, because the runway for
growth is not exactly clear yet for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you see as the most
advantageous route for people to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the three top kind of categories that
we're seeing right now are marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: sales and IT, which kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, IT is involved in everything
nowadays and marketing, sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of what your product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not selling it or getting people
interested in it, then there's no point in
[SPEAKER_01]: being in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three biggest categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation is actually a fairly small
part of it, which also kind of makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, it's really important that
people just see what they're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: and not necessarily say, well,
there's a lot of marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I need to become an expert in
marketing and change what my interest is.
[SPEAKER_01]: With any career, it's really important to
think about what you want to do and then
[SPEAKER_01]: try and see if that what your interests
are fits with the jobs that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of people who are just starting
off, maybe they're young and maybe they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still in school, a good way to go is by
doing internships so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually go work at some of these
companies and get to learn a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more about the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they might be able to find their
path in the industry that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of times we just don't know
exactly what we want to do till we start
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of doing things and then we kind of
find our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a certain territory out at
the moment that is kind of posting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the main jobs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Germany or are there other
territories around Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you see, let's say in the next
five years, as being the most advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: territory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right now, definitely the majority
of the jobs are in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany currently has the biggest medical
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the medical markets, of course,
have their issues with patient access and
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're different in each country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Germany still has the biggest medical
market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's where the most jobs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will probably continue over the next
five years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany is kind of pushing the
legalization envelope right now the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they expect to have cannabis social
clubs and home growing in the next year or
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, also have different types
of research projects, they're calling
[SPEAKER_01]: them, where you'll be able to have
legalized sales in individual cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: How those details will work, no one knows
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point being, Germany is probably
going to continue to be the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other countries like the Czech Republic
are looking at legalization, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of things can change the
dynamics very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Czech Republic were to do full
legalization before Germany, then of
[SPEAKER_01]: course, that's going to increase jobs
there dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have Portugal, Spain,
France, the UK, everyone's discussing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the bigger countries and smaller
countries are discussing different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of legalization pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that can change with politics so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who will really be the biggest market
in five or 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't really say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, it looks like it's going to
be Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the jobs, do you see the
UK as being a bit of an outlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: With Brexit happening, I would imagine
that the extra certification or the extra
[SPEAKER_00]: immigration level that's going to be
involved for employees, let's say if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in the European continent,
going to the UK and surely being taxed and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other different hurdles that are
coming to fruition from Brexit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the UK as one of the markets
that's actually going to be lacking when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to people applying for jobs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if there's an option between
Portugal and Spain and the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to have a lot of
people choosing the European continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think there's two sides to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one side, sure, if someone's in
Czech Republic or Germany and they see a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow opportunity or whatever type of
career opportunity in Portugal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's super easy for them to just go down
there and start working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the European continent,
that's going to be easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it does allow, the advantage for
the UK might be that everyone in the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: then kind of their jobs are somewhat
protected because it's more difficult for
[SPEAKER_01]: someone from the European continent to
come over and take those jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was part of the Brexit argument,
I think, all along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some sense, that might actually help
the UK market develop on its own and be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more self-sufficient and
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the UK does have a medical market
already and they're working on their
[SPEAKER_01]: different or having their discussions
about what legalization could potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it all depends on those
politics and what really happens with
[SPEAKER_01]: those legalization discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the UK were to somehow all of a sudden
do legalization, then the market would
[SPEAKER_01]: explode there and you would probably see a
lot of people trying to move over there to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think with the politicians
currently in the UK that there's any sign
[SPEAKER_00]: of legalization coming in the next few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the certain territories
around Europe, one of the things we see in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland that Ireland is very well
positioned for is being the entry point
[SPEAKER_00]: into Europe and offering services such as
law and finance and taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've obviously then got the likes of
Portugal and Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the climate for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've obviously got places like
North Macedonia and Romania doing
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the Europe is going to be
broken up into those little segments where
[SPEAKER_00]: this territory excels at this and this
territory excels at that and it all then
[SPEAKER_00]: gets moved around Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see each individual territory
having their own extraction, their own
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, their own finance?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your outlook on the European
industry when it comes to those
[SPEAKER_00]: segmentations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think in the short run,
you're going to see individual countries
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like you have in the US with
individual states having to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: have their own industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to see that in the
short term in Europe, too, because right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, for medical purposes, you can do
import and export.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for recreational purposes,
you're not going to be able to do any type
[SPEAKER_01]: of import export, it looks like,
based on the current EU regulations and
[SPEAKER_01]: the way the EU is kind of sticking to
those regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the medium to long term,
five to 10 years, you're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: those regulations be changed or
re-imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be interpreted or something
to where you're going to see regular
[SPEAKER_01]: import export between the countries,
even for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until we get to that point,
probably you're going to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, homegrown type industries,
at least for the recreational side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the homegrown side of
things, we look in Europe, it seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking into a pretty clear and concise
industry that pharmaceutical and biotech
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be taking care of drug
development and potential ingredients for
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmetics and beauty and various other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have a homegrown
rule and the kind of a social club model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the cultivation expertise in
Europe being able to grow from one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of the homegrown rule and the
social club model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that the likes of low cost
flour from Colombia and other destinations
[SPEAKER_00]: are still going to be imported into the
EU?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think that's really hard
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already have import happening from all
over the world into the EU, fully legally
[SPEAKER_01]: through some few different distributors,
importers who kind of found some
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting ways to interpret the import
rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in the long term, you're going
to see people wanting certain quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, people many times prefer
something that's more locally grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it be for environmental reasons or
nationalistic or pride reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: they want something that was grown here at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always have some imports,
but I think there's always going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: room for good quality products grown right
here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think Canada seems to be a good
model that not everybody wants the low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, huge MSO production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small cultivars and the craft growers
seem to be taking a large market share
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would imagine that if you live in
France or you live in Ireland or you live
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany or Czech Republic, that they're
going to be a little bit of national pride
[SPEAKER_00]: towards choosing the product that gets
made in your own individual country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you saw that, you know, you saw that
with craft beer, craft distilleries and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other types, these other
industries where you always have the big
[SPEAKER_01]: players who have a huge part of the market
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's room for those smaller growers
or smaller suppliers for those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where, like you said, it's quality,
it's interesting cultivars, it's playing
[SPEAKER_01]: on the national pride, different things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will always be room for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll see that also with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you're seeing it in Canada
and the US now already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it took a long time for the
craft beer and craft distillery industries
[SPEAKER_01]: to develop from the bigger industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think with cannabis, you're seeing
that kind of accelerated much more quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: just because of the other industries that
have already kind of spawned those types
[SPEAKER_01]: of craft movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one last question before we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking forward to seeing the
most happen in Europe over the next 18 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there one thing that you think will be
a domino effect or is there one personal
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you would love to see happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could see the legalisation in
Germany continue forward, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be through the individual
cities doing research projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that could get kind of ironed out,
including, which I think is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely important, having the import
allowed somehow for these research
[SPEAKER_01]: projects, which should be allowed under
the current rules, then I think you will
[SPEAKER_01]: see a huge development of those individual
city markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will, of course, then I think
really start to change the public
[SPEAKER_01]: perception of cannabis even for
recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will show people, just like it did
in the US and Canada, that it is not evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recreational or legalisation for adult
use is not going to bring all these
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible consequences and actually brings
a lot of positive consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that can get kind of sorted
somewhat in the next 18 to 24 months and
[SPEAKER_01]: start to see some data come out of that to
start changing public opinion further and
[SPEAKER_01]: hope political opinion in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy, it's been actually great talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can touch base towards the
end of the year and we've got some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements in the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any company or employee who's looking
to get into the industry, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend going to EU Cannabis Jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find them on social media, on LinkedIn and
on Twitter and give them a follow because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be at the forefront of
employment in this multi-billion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: industry over the coming year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me and I
hope you have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure and we'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a million, Andy, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that went well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it and have a great,
great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you too, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're muted.
You're muted.
You're muted.
You're muted.
You're muted.
You're muted.
You're muted.
