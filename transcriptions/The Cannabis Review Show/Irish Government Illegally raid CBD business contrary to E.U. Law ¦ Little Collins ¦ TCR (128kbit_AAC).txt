[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great show for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man has been in the news a hell of a
lot over the last couple of weeks and has
[SPEAKER_00]: been grinding great momentum in the Irish
cannabis industry and getting some good
[SPEAKER_00]: backing after some horrendous actions by
the guards in some of the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to welcome JP O'Brien,
the owner of Little Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, JP?
[SPEAKER_01]: G'day Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, mate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everybody's been looking to talk
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last couple of weeks with all the
stuff that's kind of happened here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into all of that kind of
stuff, do you want to basically give
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody just a little overview of the
story of Little Collins, how you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: started and how you got to where you are
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, Little Collins is a family
company formed by myself and my wife,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ida.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both health-driven people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're non-drinkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sort of vegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, our story is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved from Australia to Ireland to
start up this business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 17,500 kilometres and my wife's
Irish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Australian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just believe in providing people a
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a choice between a pharmaceutical
product, which is great, that everyone can
[SPEAKER_01]: get from the chemist and that's perfect,
or a natural product, a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wraps in nicely to our overall sort
of life ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been open since November 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've moved into 2018 and we're into the
start of 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the two stores and the online
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of gets everybody up to speed
of where we are at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of give what has it been like
for you guys over the last couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with all this nonsense for those
who don't understand the situation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of legislation difference
between Ireland and the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little Collins are selling CBD flare,
which is completely legal under EU law
[SPEAKER_00]: that was passed last December.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irish law just hasn't caught up with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it been like dealing with this kind
of nonsense now when you're in the right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, Owen, it's excuse me,
one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply frustrating because we
wouldn't have, you know, we did do our
[SPEAKER_01]: research and we did touch bases with all
the relevant authorities before opening
[SPEAKER_01]: the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think our solicitor actually summed
it up quite well when I first met him
[SPEAKER_01]: after the first raid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, Sean, you know what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the goalposts have shifted,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now just to catch people up,
the product that we sell is herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, excuse my dodgy hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I injured it last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's herbal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it has zero point two percent or less
THC, the psychotropic molecule compound in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant to make it legal in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we provide that as a natural
supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe in the natural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is legal throughout Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irish Island is the only member state
continuing with their kind of aggressive
[SPEAKER_01]: action towards the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the frustrating thing is that two and
a half years ago, for all intents and
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes, this stuff was legal in Ireland
as well, because I had conversations and
[SPEAKER_01]: emails with a number of authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the solicitor said, you'd hardly be
a criminal if, A, you move 17 and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand kilometers off across the world
to start your criminal organization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then B, you decided to tell the police
before you did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after verbal conversations and this,
we were assured at the beginning that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was legal in Ireland, but there is still
legislation to be amended to get Ireland
[SPEAKER_01]: in tune with the European law.
[SPEAKER_01]: European law does sit above Irish law in
this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact of that matter is,
yeah, there's a bit to work out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, yeah, that's kind of where it sits at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunate because there's so much
potential in the industry, but the Irish
[SPEAKER_01]: government does is just lagging behind a
little bit in terms of legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems a whole a whole lot of
pointless exercise for something that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows you're in the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any lawyer who looks at this legislation
properly would be able to, in a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: judge on your side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about these guys catching up
with what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways you can understand to a
degree if this is a one-solve,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas if police just saw a flower and
they don't know the difference between 0.2
[SPEAKER_00]: percent, but consistently for it to be
done when they know they're being proved
[SPEAKER_00]: to be wrong seems to be just a fool's
errand at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Owen, I'll just actually go on there
because the flower itself, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know it's hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the first six, 12 months,
we still explain this to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very confusing for us to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's just remember that hemp and
cannabis are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a difference between a
non-alcoholic beer and an alcoholic beer
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want a really generalized,
simple analogy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hemp that is legal in Europe is
cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole plant is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a whole plant philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would, to be honest, mate,
if it was a situation where over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: two years we were receiving public health
complaints and we weren't busy as a
[SPEAKER_01]: company, we weren't growing exponentially,
the Irish public wasn't accepting hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis into their lives with with glee,
quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that wasn't the situation, we'd
probably walk away because we'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, the products are a bit iffy and the
people don't want it and the law is a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: iffy anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But quite the opposite is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Irish public are screaming out for
natural alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product market fit of cannabis to
Ireland is 100 percent symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, we just feel like the
government aren't being quite transparent,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, in their communications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unfortunate that smaller
retailers like ourselves and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other retailers I'm sure you're about to
you've mentioned before, you might even
[SPEAKER_01]: mention here have been targeted to
essentially try and crush the grassroots
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that sprung up in the last two
and a half years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fair because the grassroots
industry has only one thing in mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is to create a cannabis industry
in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to send this stuff
overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to siphon profits
overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing A, B and C.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want hemp and cannabis to grow in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want local retailers selling the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want local farmers growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want adult conversations,
not opaque government that does raids and
[SPEAKER_01]: then won't even comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, they don't even say
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, where's Stephen Donnelly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Stephen Donnelly talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Except a few tweets every now and again,
like, where is the guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent in 100 copies of the proposal for
how an industry would look in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we received replies of pretty much
everybody we sent it into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single one of them directed it
back to Stephen Donnelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the only person that we haven't
received a reply from yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know whether it's lack of
education on his behalf or what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it's a lack of, it's certainly a
lack of speech, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come here, tell me there's a question on
the Delta 8 and Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen the huge increase in sales
of Delta 8 over in the states where the
[SPEAKER_00]: territories where hemp is legal because
they're getting around the laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't actually looked into that,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, have a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basically, Delta 8 is basically
synthetic version of Delta 9 THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Delta 8 has now been copied and they're
selling it at any territory where hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowed to sell Delta 8 and it's
psychoactive because it's synthetic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it was just one of those ones I
thought you might have come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell me this and tell me tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry in 10 years in Ireland,
how do you see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see in 10 years time full
dispensaries in the corners like in
[SPEAKER_00]: California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see it always staying as a
medical and pharmaceutical grade industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you one thing that will happen
and it will happen to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what degree, but it will
happen to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland will follow other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland will follow other countries,
but we are here and the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_01]: is here in Ireland to make sure that we
set our own path to a degree as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's no point just following in
other countries, because let's face it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the world's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do our own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I see it in 10 years is a very good
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told you before the show that I
think of an answer and I still haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mates, it's really hard to say in a
decade from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will tell you how I'd hope to see it
in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would hope to see, let's say,
a flourishing and growing Irish cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that is fully regulated retail
for adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over 18s can purchase THC products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no reason why in 10 years we
can't have a large manufacturing sector in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of hemp cannabis and cannabis in
this country, both large growers and small
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to see micro markets in Ireland
in terms of not sure if you've seen with
[SPEAKER_01]: the breweries, you have the large
breweries that pump out a lot of beer like
[SPEAKER_01]: Guinness, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got a micro brewery scene
where they use select ingredients and sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of high quality practices, this sort of
thing to create a really high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in Australia, where I come from,
mate, the microbrewery industry has grown
[SPEAKER_01]: larger than the main industry because
everyone loves the microbeers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're tasty, they're made with
good ingredients and ETC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing can happen with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing can definitely happen with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's blue sky horizons with cannabis in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason why Ireland can't have
the next Guinness on its hands in 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that Guinness is a cannabis bud and
it's a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an Irish strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this country can stamp its place on
the international scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need people in charge who are brave
enough and clever enough to lead this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of new frontier because any frontier is a
new frontier and it's the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although cannabis was very legal on
this planet just a few hundred years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and although cannabis grows freely on the
side of the road in places like Bhutan and
[SPEAKER_01]: the pigs eat it, we do live in a state of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of bushes to sort of
whack through to get to this sort of 10
[SPEAKER_01]: year goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need the right people in charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to all be on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to all be trying to achieve the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're not trying to achieve the same
thing, what will end up being achieved
[SPEAKER_01]: will be just a mix and match of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it won't be any good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all need to be on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, mate, the first thing we
need to do is the government need to start
[SPEAKER_01]: communicating with the industry on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now a large company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're opening a store in the heart of
Dublin this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's three cannabis dispensaries in
Ireland before, hopefully, before the
[SPEAKER_01]: government can even get the legislation
sorted out, make a simple amendment to the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1977 misuse of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick up the pen, get it done, and we can
move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, there's a few roadblocks in
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel like we're at a critical juncture
right now at the start of 2021 in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we urge everyone to continue pushing
and to continue speaking and educating
[SPEAKER_01]: about this plant because the future is
bright if we hold them to account.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's all about keeping up
the pressure now for everybody in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and realizing that we're very
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: To being able to have somewhat of an
assembled, legalized industry over here
[SPEAKER_00]: without going too overboard with full high
THC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC, there would need to be a cap,
in our opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a cap at the beginning,
at the very least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we actually set out a few
thoughts there on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something we should get on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got great people like
yourselves, of course, working hard on all
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of thing in Geno.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's done safely and correctly,
there's no reason why everyone can't win.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you very much for taking
your time to chat with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much appreciated you coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we can talk to you again in
another few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a good, happy progress
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe Stephen Donnelly might have
stuck his head and replied to somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: email at some stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be brilliant if he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lock in another chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the judicial review is a bit further
down the track, Owen, we'll have a chat
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bring you to it as well the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to chatting to you about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks a lot, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day, bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
