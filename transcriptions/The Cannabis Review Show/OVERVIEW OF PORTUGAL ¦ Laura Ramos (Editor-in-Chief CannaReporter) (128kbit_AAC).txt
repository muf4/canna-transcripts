[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of The
Canada's Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Laura Ramos.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the editor in chief of Canada
Reporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for the invitation and
good morning to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're one of the top leaders coming out
of Portugal at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't had an expert on to give
everybody a quick overview of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Portuguese market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick little overview of I know you were
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the founding members of the PTMC
and of Canada Reporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you guys have a big event coming
up with the PTMC this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick little overview of what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: PTMC it's in this third edition this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have an event on June 16 and 17 in
Lisbon and then on October 26 and 27 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Madeira Highlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an event dedicated to the scientific
part of cannabis and also to the business
[SPEAKER_00]: and networking investments on the second
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first day which will be more doctors,
researchers talking about the advances
[SPEAKER_00]: with medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the second day it will be more
dedicated to the business, the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will finish the event with a
beautiful party on a boat aboard the
[SPEAKER_00]: Targas River.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Madeira Highland in the ocean
just to party and to meet and to network
[SPEAKER_00]: and to relax a little bit to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like one to put on the calendar for
everybody watching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give everybody a quick little overview of
the Portuguese market and how everything
[SPEAKER_01]: stands over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know medicinal is legalized and you guys
are pretty much at home for cultivation in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
overview?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Portugal right now we have 18 licensed
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if my internet got a little
bit, but I will try to keep on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal has now 18 licensed companies by
InfoMed that are allowed to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational, the adult use is not yet
legalized, but I think it will be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, the 18 licensed companies,
we still have more than 80 that are
[SPEAKER_00]: awaiting an InfoMed inspection to be
authorized also to produce medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes Portugal the center,
maybe the center of excellence to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate, the professionals,
highly skilled professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe all the environment in Portugal
makes it the perfect conditions to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Portugal will be the center of
the world for cannabis, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, it's already, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know what you're talking about,
you see the money and the investment
[SPEAKER_01]: that's already gone into Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're a couple of years ahead of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark has their ornamental flower
industry, but I don't think they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: the scale that Portugal has grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be able to deliver to the European
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they don't have either the 300
days of sun, which I think makes quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have an expensive electricity bill
trying to keep up with the Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me, is there Portuguese
centered companies that have gotten a
[SPEAKER_01]: foothold early on, or has it all been
North American companies that have come
[SPEAKER_01]: over and set up facilities here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's from all over the world,
even Israel, Canada, United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: even China, Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that many countries are looking to
Portugal as the door to enter the European
[SPEAKER_00]: market and the perfect place to grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the institution that oversees
the industry over there is called
[SPEAKER_01]: INFARMED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they a governmental organization or
were they set up as an independent
[SPEAKER_01]: organization outside of government?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean INFARMED?
[SPEAKER_01]: INFARMED, yes, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, INFARMED is the regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the government and it's the
health authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are the ones who authorize
companies to produce cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you look into other markets like
hemp, it's another department.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it's INFARMED.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because we've been going around the
world and there's the various different
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory councils that are popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over in Portugal, you've got INFARMED
deals with the medical cannabis side and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's another hemp organization
that will deal with the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do those organizations fit underneath the
Department of Health or are they specific
[SPEAKER_01]: independent organizations within
government?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they are from the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So INFARMED, it's part of the health
ministry and the Gov, which is the general
[SPEAKER_00]: directorate of food and veterinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a part of the agriculture ministry
and that regulates the hemp part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have you been looking around Europe
now in terms of the next topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk about its logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know Portugal kind of grows a good
quantity and the exports have risen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 percentage year on year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the logistics, is that
something that you see a specialized
[SPEAKER_01]: company in Portugal dealing with the whole
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see that actually being a
competitive space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can imagine that the likes of
some of the smaller countries aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow their own product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The logistics side of this in Europe has
actually been a big component of the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, distribution, it's a big part
of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have special authorizations to
distribute cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there is a big company
doing this in Portugal, Logista Farma,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and they are working on this side
of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very into the, I know they are
doing this, but that you need a special
[SPEAKER_00]: license to distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like everyone can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also a little part of the market
that small companies are entering,
[SPEAKER_00]: like security, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years ago, we would never think that
security companies would be working with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have security companies in
Portugal organizing small conferences to
[SPEAKER_00]: give more information and workshops for
security professionals to enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens with so many professions
that before they couldn't even imagine one
[SPEAKER_00]: day they would be working with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the more industries that
start touching off the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: and realizing the money that's been
generated there, the more normalized it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to end up coming in due course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many will come because, as you might
know, the cannabis industry is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: will generate more employment in the
future, more jobs in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think many people that they don't
even think they could ever work with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will in the future be working
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of recreational legalization in
Portugal, you were saying that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a couple of years away.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your best estimate on when you'd be
able to go, let's say, on a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: tourist to Lisbon and be able to enjoy
like New York is just legalized for
[SPEAKER_01]: September over in New Jersey a couple of
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has dispensaries and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes now a bit of a selling
point for going somewhere on a vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's a lot of hypocrisy
all around the recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in Portugal you can smoke
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not that's why I say it's
hypocrite, because you can get cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have many people trying to sell to
tourists in downtown Lisbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, legalizing would be just
regulating this market because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening every day, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since cannabis was decriminalized,
it's not a big problem if you are smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or using cannabis anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that there's a lot of
prejudice.
[SPEAKER_00]: People still think that the people who
smoke cannabis are the drug addicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to break these myths and break
the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know from some sources inside the
parliament that it's like the taboo
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to start discussing
cannabis because there are still a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that based their arguments on myths
and psychosis or it's like a gateway drug
[SPEAKER_00]: to other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should have a serious discussion so
we could regulate to minimize also the
[SPEAKER_00]: risks, especially for youth people,
because many people don't know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cause for overdoses, the biggest cause for
overdoses in the youth people here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So teenagers are dying from alcohol coma
and they wouldn't die with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you talk with deputies or members
of the parliament, they are afraid they
[SPEAKER_00]: will die from cannabis or they will get
psychotic or schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it should be a very
serious discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: An informed discussion, not based in
myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, I think we are a little
bit far away from this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope that this will happen soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe after other countries start to
legalize in Europe, like Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, I would love to see Portugal
going in front, being the pioneer again,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we were with the criminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, I don't think we are at
that point just because of prejudice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of
misinformation on the other side and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's people fighting to keep it illegal
as much as people are fighting to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a battle that I think will go on
for another couple of years before we have
[SPEAKER_01]: a united Europe industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing I want to talk about before I
let you go is the European industry
[SPEAKER_01]: leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just roughly, I don't want you tell me to
pin your career on whoever you pick,
[SPEAKER_01]: but who do you see as having the best
companies at the moment in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Germany with them on the crisp of
the election?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Portugal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Denmark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the Netherlands?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you see as being the leader at the
moment in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, cut a little bit the connection
with the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I got the rest of your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was basically asking is which
territory do you think has the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: companies in Europe at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Denmark, the Netherlands,
Germany, Portugal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody specializes in one specific
element of this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you see has the best collection of
companies at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany is ahead for obvious
reasons because in terms of medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use and prescription and the
market is more advanced to the final
[SPEAKER_00]: users.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of production, I would say that
maybe Portugal because we are the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are producing the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, Portugal exported around 30
tons of cannabis, which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year in 2022, on the first
quarter, we already were over,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was over 20 tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will maybe probably double or more
than that the amount of exportation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in terms of production,
maybe Portugal is far ahead, but not in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of, you know, market, cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany or I don't know,
maybe the UK, because they regulated the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD now, they are far ahead Portugal,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of those 30 tons that got imported
last year, what's the percentage share of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there one dominant company that
exported 50% of that or is it spread
[SPEAKER_01]: across, let's say, 10 or 12 different
smaller operators?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked these two informants, but they
don't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just say it was 30 tons and they
don't reveal who exported the most and to
[SPEAKER_00]: where.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know some countries they exported to,
but some information they say they cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: reveal for, you know, commercial reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know who's exporting the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great to chat to you,
Lara.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who is looking to look at the
Canada Reporter, you can see the website
[SPEAKER_01]: is there at the bottom of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend checking out the
journalism over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's top grade stuff and very informative
if you're looking to learn about the
[SPEAKER_01]: European industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lara, I hope you have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Eoin, and see you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: you
