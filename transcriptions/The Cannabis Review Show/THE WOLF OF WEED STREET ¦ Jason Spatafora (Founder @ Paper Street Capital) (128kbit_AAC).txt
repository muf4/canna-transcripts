[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Jason Spadafora aka the Wolf of Weed
[SPEAKER_00]: Street who is the founder of Principal
Street Capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing Jason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic mate, thank you very much for
coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk all things investment
and the great profile that you've built
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up over the couple of years and
now kind of dominating the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: investing space on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just jump straight into
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we'll go from the first topic,
which is penny penny stocks to unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give everybody a little
overview of where the game started in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian kind of small shares and where
you're kind of at at the moment with the
[SPEAKER_00]: MSOs in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I actually started in 2013 and
this was when then Attorney General Eric
[SPEAKER_01]: Holder had given a statement that the
Department of Justice was not going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: after states that had marijuana laws on
the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a newer investor and I was like,
wow, cannabis are like pot stocks a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went and Googled it like anybody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found like 10 companies on this
website and I ended up buying one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my first penny stock I ever bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went up like 50% two days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two days later, I was like,
oh my God, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I find?
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I discovered fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two days after that, it dropped
50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up losing 150 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of hooked from there and
just kind of trying to look for these
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even Canadian companies,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple, but not too many.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is before Canopy, Aurora,
Kronos and all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really was a crap shoot in the early
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and from there, then Colorado
went legal and you didn't even really have
[SPEAKER_01]: unicorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had like stables of unicorns because
you could buy something at a half a penny
[SPEAKER_01]: back then and watch it go up 10,000 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which to put that in perspective,
if you bought a million shares of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stock at a half a penny, it would cost you
$5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it went to 50 cents, that's a half
a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were making money like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem was a lot of people just
thought it was gonna go higher and higher
[SPEAKER_01]: and higher and never took money off the
table and then watch it just go right
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the discipline in the early days was
something that you were forced to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that we still have
trouble with today in 2022, eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting that money off the table at
the appropriate time is the key to this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole game, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed a kind of let's say an
underground world or Reddit forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis investors now that are starting
to get pretty substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked to Roger Forsberg,
aka Puff Daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the show last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm starting to notice this little cult
gathering and crew happening on Twitter
[SPEAKER_00]: and on Reddit that's basically tearing the
cannabis MSOs apart and building up the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of first tier cannabis MSO,
shall we say?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I love that,
you know, cannabis has always been a cult
[SPEAKER_01]: sector, always, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've always had our, you know,
call it like our teams, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna, you know, fight it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got all of these teams
basically, you know, like fighting the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that own the arenas, you know,
called the exchanges and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, these people that were
adversaries at one point are a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: galvanized to kind of like team up and are
forced to explain like to everybody else
[SPEAKER_01]: why this is still a meaningful investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the sector has just been
absolutely hammered, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of from like a capital markets
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the businesses, on the other hand,
have been thriving, which is very hard for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's a point that I always
make that the business like you could like
[SPEAKER_01]: a strain of marijuana from one of these
companies take like a MedMen.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like MedMen is a great brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's very visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stores are nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a capital markets perspective,
like a public company, it is AIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is as close to stock market AIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if AIDS and Ebola had a baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what MedMen would be from a capital
markets perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to understand that going into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you see a lot of these people on
the Reddit forums, Twitter, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain that to all these people that it's
not so much a problem with the companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem with the exchanges that
they're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem with that there's only 95%
or there's 95% retail ownership and only
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% institutional, which basically means
that all these stocks are being priced in
[SPEAKER_01]: by complete morons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I and I say that all the
time that I think pot stock investors you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, 90% of them are probably the dumbest
people in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's a lot to be left to
the imagination if you can't read a
[SPEAKER_00]: balance sheet or read a profit and loss
sheet or even see what kind of cash flow
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these companies have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what seems to be happening
is that the vast majority of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: investors have no nuanced financial skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody basically been able to
explain to them, look, this is why this
[SPEAKER_00]: stock is Man United and this stock is Real
Madrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of value and I think
that's going to be the next, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: wave of financial gain in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it as the media and the influencers
being able to have a direct voice to these
[SPEAKER_00]: large consumer bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, some are true leaf,
some are cure leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a little tribal situation
that seems to be happening in the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: investor market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's also there's a little
bit of nuance in there as well as being an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you always and I'm sure
you've seen it where I think that people
[SPEAKER_01]: that dollar cost average in cannabis are
always going to get killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning like they have a budget and I'm
going to buy some here, I'm going to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: some there and then I'll buy some a little
bit further down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it goes down, I just buy some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's never worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've always been somebody that
core trades position, meaning like I have
[SPEAKER_01]: a set position that I buy usually in the
summertime and I have like call that 80
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with that 20 percent on the
upswing, I do trade it as a means to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire position, but also take it as
almost like a dividend, meaning like I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: give you a quick rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say I buy a thousand shares of the stock
at ten dollars and then it goes to eleven
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I sell two hundred and fifty shares.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that's twenty five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now it goes back down to ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rebuy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just buy back two hundred and fifty
shares.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pocket the difference, which is a two
hundred and fifty bucks and I save it for
[SPEAKER_01]: a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that served me, you know, also like
going into February to the summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the back half of the year and
that time period, which I call the Ides of
[SPEAKER_01]: March, like you're not buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not taking on size.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market has sucked since 2014 from
March to summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's when you're you're not
increasing your exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're decreasing it and you're waiting
for that that summer low to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy stuff back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like my last and final rule is if
anything that I own ever hits an all time
[SPEAKER_01]: high in February, which is right before
that March start, I sell 30 percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: position no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's at a minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in February of twenty one, where
everything hit an all time high,
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing that saved me a lot of grief
across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there is some nuance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't, you know, you have to remember
these are all speculative companies at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day in a sector that is going
to be wildly different 10 years from now
[SPEAKER_01]: than it is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you go back to when
Prohibition ended, there was like 300
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now there's 10 and maybe you can
name five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of information and data and I
think you need to be consuming at your
[SPEAKER_00]: level that people aren't just going to be
able to pick the right solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a huge amount of data that
needs to be consumed on a daily basis to
[SPEAKER_00]: make those nuanced decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump on to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the Wolf of Weed
Street, the moniker you have on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that just come out of the movie and
you put one and one together and got two
[SPEAKER_00]: or was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I would say that's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was engaged at the time and my fiance
went out with a bunch of her friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just so happened to have off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing something completely different
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, nobody's home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm going to, you know,
smoke a joint and watch some TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw a trailer for the Wolf of Wall
Street and I was like, haha, Wolf of Weed
[SPEAKER_01]: Street, that would be a funny name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I bet somebody on Twitter
already has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to Twitter and nobody had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, just make a goof of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put like a Photoshopped head of a
wolf on Leonardo DiCaprio's body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just a goof to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, I can talk about all
of these companies that I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're really scammy anonymously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like no recourse, like I could
just say whatever I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were really, you know,
responsive to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just kind of like show things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, at the end of the day,
like we were all kind of in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was not a lot of information out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I did was I was
using people, you know, via Twitter to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if a lot of these early companies were
real or if they were P.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would send somebody up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, hey, does anybody live in,
you know, like Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody be like, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you 100 bucks on PayPal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go to this address and if
it's a P.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: box, just take a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not, here's some questions to go
in and ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding a lot of companies that were just
P.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, from there, that developed
like the Wolfpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and I had a small amount of
followers and Colorado had gone legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of my friends who,
you know, called me randomly one day and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's like, I want you to sell all of your
pot stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, why would I sell?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, there's a thing,
there's an article coming out on
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloomberg, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, and I'm watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, there's like short positions,
like building up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I was like, OK,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I got a Bloomberg terminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what's a Bloomberg terminal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I get off the phone with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my account is at an all time high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just tweet his warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, sector takedowns
in effect, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get up, you know, 30 minutes later,
hour later, the whole entire cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is January 10th,
2014, dropped 60 percent in an afternoon
[SPEAKER_01]: in an afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember my account was at like
seventy five thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, it closed at
like twenty nine thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because I've been looking at the
sector so hard, I had a pretty good idea
[SPEAKER_01]: where like what the good companies were
and where it would bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of divided what I had left into
these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, everybody just kind of
followed along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the wolf just kind of got bigger
and bigger from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's not following along,
I should highly recommend that you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: get over to Twitter and follow the Wolf of
Wall Street and Weed Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last thing before we go, I want to
just touch on the true trading group that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give everybody just a little
overview of that organization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, during like this is something
because, you know, when we were going back
[SPEAKER_01]: and I talked about that first website that
I went on to find pot stocks, that was
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana stocks dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a site that myself and my two
other partners, Mike and Adam,
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up buying, which was kind of like
full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then True Trading Group was an idea
that Adam had to basically get out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: investor relations world and make it like
an educational platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it like Netflix, but for trading
where you pay one price and then you get
[SPEAKER_01]: all these things, you know, like all the
content, all the courses, the tests,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything all in one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during and then COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I honestly like I really
didn't want much to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was I was already doing it on
Twitter, like telling people what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just found like all these people
were really ungrateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became a moderator there and now part
owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we basically started with like 300
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're at 10,000 with the whole idea of
like, there's a lot of things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a whole
psychological aspect to investing and
[SPEAKER_01]: trading that nobody talks about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so True Trading Group has really
just become like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This monster of a platform where people
can can learn and listen to people that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have done it, are doing it,
plus have the benefit of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, five thousand other eyeballs out
there with all these things where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you don't want to trade real
money, we've got you can paper trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like simulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, you know, live squawk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get news as it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, really, it's just a place
where you can learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we make you take tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to like learn options,
OK, well, we have a whole course on
[SPEAKER_01]: options and you've got to go through it
and take a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you know that you're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set up a reward system, you know,
through there.
It's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people can try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For like three bucks for a week and you
get some courses and then you can also
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to us like throughout the course of
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about like getting alerts
and somebody telling you what to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that that doesn't that only works
so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to make your own
trades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, that's that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people stay for the ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd highly recommend everybody
checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the details we posted to the links
below for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not following Wolf of Wall
Street, we three get it sorted now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason, thank you very much for joining me,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure chatting to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to chat again in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start keeping an eye on the
European stocks for you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be lots of opportunities
coming over here with Germany legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: now, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm involved in a company in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we'll have to talk about that
one day, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will indeed, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great day and thanks again for
your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
