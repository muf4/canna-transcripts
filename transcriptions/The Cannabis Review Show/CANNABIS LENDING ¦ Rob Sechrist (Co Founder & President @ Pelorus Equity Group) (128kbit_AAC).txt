[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by a financial
powerhouse in the industry, Rob Seacrest,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's the co-founder and president of
Polaurus Equity Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Rob?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man,
so we'll keep this as brief as we possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to give the audience an
overview on what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis lending space at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of the Polaurus Fund that you've set up to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal specifically with cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polaurus Equity Group was the first
US-based domestic lender in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We entered the space in about 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since that time, we've done about 69 deals
for about $430 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking that lending platform and
we're starting our initial due diligence
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at the European market and other
markets to bring that same lending
[SPEAKER_01]: platform to provide debt to cannabis use
property owners across the country and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically now in Europe and some other
countries as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically bringing the state of finance
to the European industry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading about your Java's 11.8
billion round of funding that you recently
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the metrics you look for in a
good investment opportunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the top two things that you at
the Polaurus Fund would look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regardless of what country that we're
lending in, we're always going to look for
[SPEAKER_01]: a very experienced cannabis operator who
may or may not be the owner of the
[SPEAKER_01]: building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically they are what we call an owner
user.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next most important thing is we want a
strong sponsor to support that
[SPEAKER_01]: transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the transactions that we do are
value add, meaning that we are providing
[SPEAKER_01]: the capital to acquire and build the
facility as a bridge loan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, they're going to
refinance that loan with a lower cost
[SPEAKER_01]: lender once it's fully built.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that model, we need an extremely
strong sponsor that has the personal
[SPEAKER_01]: balance sheet income and credit to support
the size of the loan that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: borrowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's somebody that's trying to
borrow like that $11.8 million
[SPEAKER_01]: transaction, we need to have somebody that
can support that, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual or corporate guarantee to do
that transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing is, is that we require
a commercial piece of real estate,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning that we'll do commercial buildings
and or greenhouses, but no agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes there is land tied up with
the commercial buildings, but we're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: our value to the buildings, not the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys have seen, I see you're at
the ICBC in Berlin next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing Germany as the kind of
first step into Europe for you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have you been in discussions in Malta
or Denmark or other territories in this
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so preliminary right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just returned from the ICBC in
London a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're trying to get comfortable
with is how does any of the European
[SPEAKER_01]: market work if you can import from other
countries that don't have to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: the same ultra high building compliance
and employee expenses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And electric expenses and all the other
expenses that are so high in the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Union, let's just say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have countries that are able
to import.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get our arms wrapped
around how this is going to work for these
[SPEAKER_01]: countries if they're going to build their
own facilities within their own country or
[SPEAKER_01]: within the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first thing that we're
trying to really get our arms wrapped
[SPEAKER_01]: around to make us feel comfortable if
we're gonna do any lending in the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in Europe, if you could import at a
lower cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think what will happen over
in Europe, you'll obviously gonna have the
[SPEAKER_00]: low cost import options that are gonna be
available, but we're renowned for farming
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see genetics and different strains
being created in each different country
[SPEAKER_00]: over here that's gonna be unique to this
part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll almost be like wine to a degree
that special farmers are gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: create specific genetics that make their
industry that little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're just a couple of years
away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see Germany, obviously at the moment,
it's now a race to who can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheapest flour in like it kind of does in
a lot of the industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you're gonna start to see once
the agriculture and farming grants or
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies allow this, you'll start to see a
huge amount of talent flow into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're anxious to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the same thought process as you
comparing California markets, which has
[SPEAKER_01]: the brand name and the strains and for the
rest of the country and thinking that
[SPEAKER_01]: those other states across the country
would not be able to compete with strains
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had to evolve that thinking
process after I've toured many facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in emerging states that now
already have the caliber and quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: high end product that would compete easily
head to head with California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to understand, is this
going to happen here in the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Union?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to think about,
okay, how long does it take to start the
[SPEAKER_01]: importation process when you're importing
into Germany or wherever it might be from
[SPEAKER_01]: the day that paperwork is submitted until
that product lands in the European Union?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that product going to be able to
compete directly with something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: grown domestically within the European
Union?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the things I'm trying to
learn myself about while we'll be there
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll be touring some facilities and
looking at what's happening there and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to understand the pros and cons of
what might happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the legislation is still not
decided, it's difficult to start making
[SPEAKER_01]: bets and trying to see how it's going to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, nothing has really
happened for quite some time since the
[SPEAKER_01]: most consequential legislation passed
there, which was the Robach or Blumenauer
[SPEAKER_01]: Amendment that defunded our Department of
Justice for prosecution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Hemp Act, which doesn't really
apply exactly to what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you said at the start of the
show as well, operators are one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you look for in an investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to be the case over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realistically, California has got a maze
in Florida due to the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia and some of the South American
territories in Portugal, to a degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: can compete with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you understand HVAC systems,
environmental control systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really just need an amazing operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're going to be able to
compete because realistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're comparing 24% THC to 26% THC,
the consumer doesn't really know that they
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the flavonoids and the terpenes
and the flavors and smells that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get out of the plant and what
it's going to look like compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: strength, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a process for the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, as new markets emerge,
they're willing to take inferior products
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting about that is that
typically, the illegal products are
[SPEAKER_01]: superior in quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually, hopefully, those legal
products will get to the same quality that
[SPEAKER_01]: the domestic consumers are going to
appreciate and look for, those premium
[SPEAKER_01]: high-end brands that make sense to grow
them domestically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another market I'm looking forward to
seeing is New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on board in September now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the genetics that the hipsters in
Brooklyn are going to be producing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, is going to be pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of these genetics, it's one thing to
have one that's an amazing brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you have to have it be a consistent
genetic that can continually reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's more to it than just having a
one-off product that you can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at this amazing strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: To produce that consistently is a
challenge that every brand goes through to
[SPEAKER_01]: make chairs that they have a consistent
quality of product at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you see Denmark are
probably the leaders in Europe at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment when it comes to cannabis flower,
just from their ornamental flower industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fact that they have government
backing in finance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just jump on to the next
topic before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's how to value a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, everybody's kind of seeing the
Canadian nightmare that's happened over
[SPEAKER_00]: the past six to seven years with the
billions of dollars that have been wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the core metrics for evaluating a
cannabis company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that's a year in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have to have IP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an IP to rating?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the core metrics for a man of your
level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So us, unfortunately, it's a case by case
scenario for every transaction that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first part for us is that we're
not valuing, per se, the value of the
[SPEAKER_01]: company for the cannabis operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not our job because we're not
utilizing the cannabis company or the
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprise value of the cannabis company
as our lending basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're purely evaluating the cannabis
operator on their level of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically that might shake out in
their performance of how they've done thus
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not always necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see that that cannabis operator
has the experience and capability to
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not trying to learn how to
cultivate already.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already figured that part out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for us, when we're looking at a
facility, we're looking at we establish
[SPEAKER_01]: our lending basis off of the value of the
facility, the tenant improved the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment and the equipment that are going
into that facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's a lot more easy to
extrapolate what the value is because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're only lending off of the real estate
basis and not off the enterprise value of
[SPEAKER_01]: the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so pretty much anybody in the
manufacturer and edibles can fit into this
[SPEAKER_00]: category because the equipment and the
property they're going to have is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be of value same way as pre-roll machines
and facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of fit into every facet of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most of the time people are going to
come to us for larger builds is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in our domestic program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, being that cannabis is
going to be is legal in each of these
[SPEAKER_01]: states federally, the banks will be able
to lend there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have a smaller facility
that's that's extraction or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you might be able to get a
traditional loan on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to see how that plays out to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically the banks are not going to
value these properties the same way you
[SPEAKER_01]: would a typical commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's usually where we become a
lending advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand how to build these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand how to process the draws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all that infrastructure in place
and we've competed in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: against banks for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no way they can compete with
us on a value add or construction type
[SPEAKER_01]: loan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that facility is fully stabilized,
meaning that's cash flowing on its own,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can start looking to traditional
banks to refinance that debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're very busy, man, so I won't
take up too much more your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at ICBC in
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for taking your
time today, Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the next time episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
