[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to another episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Marianne Zandies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marianne is the head of medical cannabis
at Malta Enterprise and for those who've
[SPEAKER_00]: been keeping up to date on the news,
you'll have heard that Malta are making a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of moves with the medical cannabis
industry in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a new tech startup and Malta
Enterprise by all accords are going after
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry with Augusto and it's great
to be joined by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping Marianne?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're keeping very well here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to chat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see Malta Enterprise making
such innovative moves in this industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of lessons to be learned by
the rest of the European governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we basically give everybody just a
quick overview of how you ended up at
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta Enterprise and the cannabis industry
in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malta Enterprise has been pivotal in the
setting up of this industry from its very
[SPEAKER_01]: first inception.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when two years and a half ago,
almost three years ago, we started
[SPEAKER_01]: conceiving of a legislation which allows
for the use of cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes as well as research purposes,
Malta Enterprise has had a central role
[SPEAKER_01]: both in establishing the legislation as
well as attracting the top companies in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sector to start setting up their
activities in Malta.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we have gone along throughout these
three years, we have not only continued to
[SPEAKER_01]: attract key companies to start working
from Malta, but have also supported them
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the implementation of their
setting up stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because we've spoken to a couple of
the people that you have over there like
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Pateras from Materia Ventures,
Deepak who we spoke about and then we had
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonas Simerman on two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you seem to be developing and
cultivating a lot of the top talent in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry are making Malta their base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things I think Ireland are
well behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see Europe in the next long term
overview, I see Malta and Ireland being
[SPEAKER_00]: two of the premier destinations for your
corporation with the incentivised tax
[SPEAKER_00]: rates, with the highly skilled workforce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Malta have just gotten out of
the blocks so much quicker than Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the leaders over here aren't
as forward thinking as the guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you have in charge in Malta.
[SPEAKER_00]: First topic that I'm going to move
straight onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I hope to see on a lot of
packaged products in the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry over the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the made in Malta sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell all the audience a little bit
about this and what's the strategy behind
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The made in Malta sign should be a synonym
of high quality pharmaceutical grade
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm using the term pharmaceutical on
purpose and not medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason being that the regulator in
Malta, the Malta Medicines Authority is
[SPEAKER_01]: making it a requirement that all the
facilities are EUGMP licensed as though
[SPEAKER_01]: they were producing a fully fledged
pharmaceutical with a marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: authorisation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even these are medical products and do
not require a marketing authorisation or
[SPEAKER_01]: do not as yet have a marketing
authorisation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One can rest assured that the process is
as rigorous and as restricting as the one
[SPEAKER_01]: where producing a fully fledged
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only, but the ownership of the product
by the producer does not stop at the point
[SPEAKER_01]: of batch release from the production
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ownership continues up to the
stage where the distributor releases that
[SPEAKER_01]: product on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the distributor releases the
product on the market, the ownership and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore the responsibility and the
liability are still held by the producer
[SPEAKER_01]: in Malta.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously indicative of the very
high quality and how seriously we are
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the sector and how not difficult,
but how rigorous and thorough we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical cannabis sector in Malta
builds over decades of experience in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is not something that everyone
is aware of, but Malta has a very
[SPEAKER_01]: important pharmaceutical cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very well consolidated cluster with
renowned names operating in the sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals,
for instance, operate from Malta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has made it such that Malta has
not only the right environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are the right skills,
we have the right regulatory expertise and
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a consolidated and established
cluster, which is enabled also by a very
[SPEAKER_01]: robust ancillary industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, when you consider the
cluster, the cluster has its own dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: printing press, which is dedicated to
printing of foils, vignettes, labels and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other materials related to the
pharma industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have precision engineering companies
which provide the industry with the
[SPEAKER_01]: tooling, for instance, tableting machines,
encapsulating machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are companies which are specialized
in automation lines and therefore they
[SPEAKER_01]: come in very handy for the packaging lines
and the automated bottling lines and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a very, very healthy cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it came to evolving into the
medical cannabis scenario, it was building
[SPEAKER_01]: up on all of this expertise and this has
facilitated the industry in various ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: These last two days I've been touring
around the facilities that are currently
[SPEAKER_01]: setting up in the medical cannabis sector
and all of them boasted of a team which is
[SPEAKER_01]: highly skilled and highly operational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these companies were enabled to set up
so quickly in Malta, mostly because they
[SPEAKER_01]: found the right skills, the right
regulatory environment and the regulator
[SPEAKER_01]: which is highly competent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Malta Medicines Authority is in fact
one of the most highly reputed authorities
[SPEAKER_01]: within the EU and it was one of the first
seven which were also FDA accredited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this goes to show how highly reputed
the Medicines Agency is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the Medicines Authority as the
regulator of the sector gives more
[SPEAKER_01]: credibility, more reassurance to anyone
who is going to use the made in Malta
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing that made in
Malta brand grow now over the next couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a phenomenal idea and as I
said, I think when you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of Europe, it's got to be Malta
and Ireland that can sell the services and
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific sectors for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're never going to be the mass
cultivation operator corporations but like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys have done, the extraction,
the distillation, the packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can all be done in a country that has
a great corporate tax rate, a great
[SPEAKER_00]: skilled workforce and I think most global
corporations when they're finally in this
[SPEAKER_00]: space in Europe, it'll be between Ireland
and Malta as with the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Pfizer and the likes here and
you guys have Moderna and a few others
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an amazing to see and I know
again, you've got so much talent that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about what it's like attracting
the talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific, are you guys pitching
to companies or are you guys having
[SPEAKER_00]: companies come to you and you're setting
then the specific terms and framework that
[SPEAKER_00]: allows them to basically grow their
companies at the best rate possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously three years ago, we were one
of the first movers and we had first mover
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we didn't make it too easy in
that we adopted a process which is a two
[SPEAKER_01]: stage process and the first process is to
apply with Malta enterprise for a letter
[SPEAKER_01]: of intent and that gives you the green
light to start implementing your project
[SPEAKER_01]: and then eventually you start working with
the medicine authority in order to obtain
[SPEAKER_01]: the license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our application process is very,
very rigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to, in the first years when we
were attracting the top companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were three main criteria namely the
financial viability of the project that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking into, obviously due
diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important in all sectors,
but in cannabis, it was even more
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even the most minor of glitches could
result in the non-approval of the project
[SPEAKER_01]: and third but not least, we were looking
at experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the beginning, we wanted to make
sure that anyone who is operating in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sector has an established record of
producing cannabis and dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in the sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that meant that the first companies
that were attracted to Malta included the
[SPEAKER_01]: big names like Afria, like MGC,
like Amac Life Sciences, we have Panaxia,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Materia, we have Cauchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was being first mover and having
this process, this transparent process in
[SPEAKER_01]: place, obviously attracted the big names
into coming to Malta.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this stage, however, we are also
looking and hence for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tech4Can, we are also looking at adding
depth and layers to the industry by
[SPEAKER_01]: opening up to startup activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Startups bring energy, startups bring
enthusiasm, startups bring innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you have a healthy cluster of
startups operating in any sector,
[SPEAKER_01]: you cannot guarantee that you are going to
have research, innovation and development
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our next phase where we are
looking at key startup activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are finding ways how to support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tech4Can is, and I can say the name
because they have rendered it public
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, are very eager to start up
their tech accelerator activity from
[SPEAKER_01]: Malta.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the first medical
cannabis accelerator in all of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the industry is not only attracting
just the top companies, but also adding
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, depth and interest by having these
other companies joining in the cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the proper direction
as opposed to focusing on just one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: of the large corporations cultivating a
sector that provides a multitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: services will ensure the longevity of the
Made in Malta brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can touch base again in towards
the end of the year and see where Made in
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta has grown to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you very much for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marianne, I hope you have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for inviting me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
Oh.
