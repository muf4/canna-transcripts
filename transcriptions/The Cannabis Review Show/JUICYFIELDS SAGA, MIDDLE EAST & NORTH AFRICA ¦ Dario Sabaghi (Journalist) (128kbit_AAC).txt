[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Dario Sabagi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dario is a renowned journalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's internested in international news,
human rights and cannabis and he's written
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of the world's top media
publications like Forbes, High Times,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rolling Stones and Middle East Eye to name
just a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping Dario?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is fine, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been putting out some amazing
content across a multitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be great to have you on
and help introduce the audience to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the big stories that are happening at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: covering cannabis as a journalist and what
brought you into the space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically I started covering cannabis like
two or three years ago and working with an
[SPEAKER_01]: English publication with Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started covering cannabis from Italy
about some stories from Italy because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the country where I come from and then I
started to collaborate with other news
[SPEAKER_01]: media organizations including High Times,
Forbes but at the same time I cover Middle
[SPEAKER_01]: East news from the Middle East regarding
politics and economics and regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis I also be an editor-in-chief of
the Italian edition of with Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called with Word Italy for one year
and a half and then now I'm working as a
[SPEAKER_01]: freelance journalist covering both
cannabis and international news with a
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've subscribed to your Middle Eastern
newsletter and I highly suggest anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who hasn't subscribed and is interested to
learn about that territory of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: check it out on his website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can subscribe to everything there but
moving on to the first story for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast that I wanted to talk about it's
the Juicy Field story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a big news at the moment in
the cannabis industry how a group of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: created an investment platform that turned
into a Ponzi scheme and ran away with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody your expert
overview of that scenario in that case so
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get people up to speed on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well yes I started to cover a Juicy Field
story just a few days ago actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other publications such as a Yario and a
Space Pin and Zero covered this topic for
[SPEAKER_01]: months because of this alleged scheme
Juicy Field basically was a crowdfunding
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis platform where people could
invest to buy a plant to be cultivated,
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest and sold and but at the same time
it was discovered that it could be a Ponzi
[SPEAKER_01]: scheme in the sense that the website is
not working more actually and people just
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot withdraw their deposits and now
there are some private investigation about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on there on Juicy Field
platform and actually there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyers working on it basically it seems
that the owners of the platform belong to
[SPEAKER_01]: three people with Russian passports and
they just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the CEO of the former CEO of Juicy
Field said he didn't know anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: that but of course the investigation are
ongoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no official news yet of the
developing story and basically a Ponzi
[SPEAKER_01]: scheme is based on the fact that the early
investors get the money from the newer
[SPEAKER_01]: investors so in that way the Ponzi scheme
is functioning for the owners to collect
[SPEAKER_01]: all money possible and disappear suddenly
and Juicy Field was mainly focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation but investors most of
them were from Latin America, Spain and
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe with some users also from Asia and
North America but as the coverage suggests
[SPEAKER_01]: to me that most users were from Germany,
Spain and Latin America and but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: also like Italian or British users so it
was a very huge platform in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry because it counted about
500,000 users according to Juicy Field
[SPEAKER_01]: official records but at the same time you
know the cannabis industry is a very new
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is a very volatile and stumps can
happen like in any other new industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah no I agree there's I think this won't
be the last opportunistic company that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see preying on people's investment and
people's money because as you said it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still unregulated there's still a lot of
black holes to the to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest article you wrote we reposted
on the cannabis review was about
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland legalized medical cannabis and
imports and exports do you see those that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know Spain legalized and they're saying
within six months they're gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis program up and running do
you think Switzerland are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: within that time frame or within 12 months
or is it still too too early to tell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well cannabis was already legal for
specific conditions and but now from 1st
[SPEAKER_01]: of August it will be fully legalized which
means a patient won't have authorization
[SPEAKER_01]: to the agency but simply a physician could
prescribe cannabis for them and also
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis would be with a high level of CBD
although the THC should be cut at the 1%
[SPEAKER_01]: but probably it could be more we have to
see about that about the implementation of
[SPEAKER_01]: the law and of course could be a very good
news for European countries which are
[SPEAKER_01]: lacking of supplies for example in Italy
most of the supplies come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands and other parts of Europe or
Canada through Aurora Cannabis company and
[SPEAKER_01]: but also all the other states have lots of
cannabis supplies so there are many
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that's depends on what kind of
condition the legislation allow to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis and also for Spain which
has recently legalized cannabis although
[SPEAKER_01]: I've interviewed some experts in the field
of Spanish cannabis industry which have
[SPEAKER_01]: been told is the very limited legislation
which won't solve the problem at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah we had Dr Dan Celas-Kioga on the
episode recently and he was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: outlining that six months is a little bit
ambitious for Spain to think and even the
[SPEAKER_00]: the language used in the ruling is still
unclear which are whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized physician or he was even
saying that it's a doctor with no conflict
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest is the one who has to
prescribe but as I said trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out that web of knowledge will be a tough
one for the Spanish regulators I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically move on now to Middle East North
African cannabis and the various
[SPEAKER_00]: territories in there basically there's a
lot of countries and I wanted to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: cover them all so I've got a list of all
the top countries in this space and I
[SPEAKER_00]: basically want to run through them and I
want to give you get you to give them an A
[SPEAKER_00]: or an F depending on how good their
cannabis industry is okay so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: unfair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right so first one is Algeria where does
Algeria stand A or F?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well except if we talk about regulation of
cannabis or all the recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: all the Middle East countries are which
means nobody legalized cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use and so Algeria is
included on that although there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal cultivation some legal
trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay perfect Bahrain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bahrain the same the same also even CBD is
considered illegal because it's a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant which is considered
illegal there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's what we think Bahrain is one
of the strictest ones Egypt anything
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in Egypt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Egypt has a long history of a cannabis
culture since the 18th century they were
[SPEAKER_01]: or even before there was largely consumed
by the population which is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: populated Arab country and but still is
illegal there are trafficking between
[SPEAKER_01]: upper Sinai and with a border with Gaza
Strip and but it's illegal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Iran and Iraq I'm pretty much going to
put together presume it's as highly
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal there as it is in Bahrain that
there's not even a CBD market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean Iran is even I mean drug
trafficking could be punished with death
[SPEAKER_01]: penalty as well so Iraq I'm not sure about
that penalty but of course it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah some of the countries seem to be
you know Israel we know of obviously has a
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving medical industry at the moment
and export industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Israel is a different story Israel we
can is has no legalized recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medical cannabis could be used
for certain usage but at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: what's interesting about Israel is the
research we don't have to forget that THC
[SPEAKER_01]: was isolated there in 1964 by Mecholam Dr.
Rachel Mecholam in 1964 was isolated there
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's a long history with the research
and also recently is one of the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: import of cannabis I think even more than
Germany actually and it started to export
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to the US recently a couple of
months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so Jordan is there any movement in
Jordan they seem to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: forward-thinking king now?
[SPEAKER_01]: No Jordan as well same legislation on
other countries previous it and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kuwait illegal as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lebanon was the first country to legalize
medical cannabis on 2020 to with the hope
[SPEAKER_01]: to to contain the economic crisis that
started in late 2019 however has not been
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented the legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time so there is just a loop
but there's no preventive no companies
[SPEAKER_01]: working with it no farmers as well at the
same time Lebanon has long history with
[SPEAKER_01]: the hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lebanese hashish was one of the top-notch
hashish in the world along with Moroccan
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish and it exported legally with
dropping vote to Middle East country and
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I've just finished a book about the
Phoenicians and hashish and Lebanon pops
[SPEAKER_00]: up a little bit in at the the kings of
trading in the Mediterranean a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago so how about Libya then is there
any action in Libya?
[SPEAKER_01]: Libya there is no legislation as well
everything is legal regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco we we know that there's a movement
happening there to a degree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Morocco legalized medical cannabis
and industrial half in 2021 and to contain
[SPEAKER_01]: also the drug trafficking there and help
farmers from the region to go legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time Morocco is the first
supplier of hashish in the European
[SPEAKER_01]: continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recreational cannabis still continue to
be illegal although there is some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: the tourism regarding the legal cannabis
and cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So European western tourists goes to
Morocco also to see to have a tour in this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of in these farms in a rich region
and other parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so I'm gonna bunch Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
[SPEAKER_00]: and Yemen in together no laws pretty much
not a chance of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone even regarding CBD some months
ago or seven years ago I don't remember
[SPEAKER_01]: well but a British citizen was jailed for
for carrying on CBD oil in United Arab
[SPEAKER_01]: Emirates as well so it's a strict deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Palestine, anything happen in
Palestine?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Palestine also it's legal and also
there are it's widely consumed in all this
[SPEAKER_01]: country you just mentioned so including
Palestine is a cannabis consumed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got Syria, Tunisia and
Turkey anything happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah all the country are illegal cannabis
there is legal Syria have some cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: as well that could export something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turkey is illegal as well and what's the
other country you just mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunisia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tunisia as well they have good hashish
quality they have some crops they export
[SPEAKER_01]: something I believe as well but yeah still
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay yeah I think it's been very
informative I love learning about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different territories that are happening
at the moment for anybody who hasn't read
