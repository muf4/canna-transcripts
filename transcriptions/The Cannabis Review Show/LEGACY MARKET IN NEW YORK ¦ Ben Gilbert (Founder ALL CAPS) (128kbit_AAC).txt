[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Ben Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben is the founder of a New York media
company called All Caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's previously a digital journalist for
the likes of Business Insider,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now he specializes in ghost-writing PR
and event promotion for the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, how are you keeping today,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little rainy, a little dreary here,
and I think that means fall has officially
[SPEAKER_01]: started in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll go back to being hot,
but I've been better on the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is going great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the same over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me when everybody goes back to
school, the rain starts to fall out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavens over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're having one of those days as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm delighted you could join us on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to help inform everybody
about all things New York as much as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can, of which you know a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
overview of how you came from Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Insider to set up All Caps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent the last 13 years or so in New
York media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for, believe it or not,
AOL for many years for a website named
[SPEAKER_01]: Engadget, a tech website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prior to that, I worked for a video
game publication and then eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: Business Insider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was that for the last seven or so years
and decided approximately across the last
[SPEAKER_01]: year while doing a little coverage of the
cannabis market here and legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: happened here in March of 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ever since then, really, I mean,
to be totally frank, going way back,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a cannabis user for 20 plus
years, daily user.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a big fan of using cannabis as a
part of vacation where I go to California,
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to Amsterdam or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of love for the culture of
cannabis personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was watching it a little bit as a
journalist, covering a little bit as a
[SPEAKER_01]: journalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I covered cookies a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I covered some of the local growers in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really just seemed like a great
moment to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was ever a going to be a moment
that I was going to switch careers from
[SPEAKER_01]: journalism into something else,
something else I was really passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about, this was the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really been the driving force
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped working as a journalist in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started my company in mid July.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we launched the New York Growers Cup
soon afterwards, me and a couple of local
[SPEAKER_01]: growers in late July.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really been, you know,
out of the frying pan into the fryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, long time consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I love the part that you used
to go on holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I was over in New
York in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went over with my wife and another
couple of friends and we couldn't believe
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my buddy were like seeing weed
trucks everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like a kid in a candy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that's been taken away because
of the parking fines and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: policy unions that happen in Manhattan to
be able to take care of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't wait until the days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I go back over there towards the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started next year and there's real
proper dispensaries that I can go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a full scale consumer experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say even right now there are a lot
of dispensaries operating in the gray
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be totally honest, it's frankly
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not necessarily the gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely just straight up illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, there's levels of discretion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some places that are just
operating as storefronts that are straight
[SPEAKER_01]: up operating a dispensary like you would
see in a legal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some places that are
operating like social clubs or consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: lounges where they also have dispensary
within them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are a little bit more discreet a
lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's really like a very I think
that it's referred to often as the gray
[SPEAKER_01]: market here right now because there's some
level of the state looking the other way,
[SPEAKER_01]: the city looking the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned briefly that some of the
trucks had been towed, had been fined,
[SPEAKER_01]: were receiving parking fines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another number of trucks that
were fined for having edible sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were fined for essentially selling
food without a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that did happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some enforcement measures on
that, but the city is still rife with
[SPEAKER_01]: trucks and people literally setting up
tables and selling off tables on the
[SPEAKER_01]: street.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to visit New York City,
there's still plenty of options for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned from my 420 jurist,
the difference between a license and a
[SPEAKER_00]: permit when it comes to New York is a big
difference between keeping your business
[SPEAKER_00]: and not let's jump on to the first topic
that I kind of wanted to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the legacy market in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, is there a good legacy market product
in New York that's going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, do you see, let's say,
brand names that used to be big in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy market in New York coming back to
the fore now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like what Night Gaddy does,
McDonald's, the brand name is what the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer generally will move towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York is a very particular place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm speaking specifically in New York
City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, New York is a very large state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very different market upstate
than there is downstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York City, though, has traditionally
been a distributor market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis comes in from other states and
it gets sold here, usually at a markup,
[SPEAKER_01]: largely from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still the case for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a ton of California product
here that's being sold and a lot of brand
[SPEAKER_01]: loyalty from the most hard core,
the biggest weed nerds in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of loyalty to large
California brands, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You still see a lot of that stuff and a
lot of that being sold and used for cloud
[SPEAKER_01]: online and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, in terms of legacy growers in
New York, there's certainly a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are just now having a chance to
really rise to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in varying levels of readiness
for the legalization when they are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply for cultivation licenses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because New York legalized in March
2021 does not mean that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses are available yet, as you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a cultivator in New York
state, if you've been growing as part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the legacy market indoors, there's no real
way to legally apply for a cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: license yet because the state hasn't
started that process yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a number of people,
though, who are longtime cultivators who
[SPEAKER_01]: are part of the legacy market,
some of which I'm working with on the New
[SPEAKER_01]: York Grower's Cup, who are really,
really ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who have investors, who have blueprints,
who have facilities that they are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of starting leases on and really
ready to go and ready to jump into the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market in a legit way the moment
that they are able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely see a lot of opportunity
for especially for growers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot harder, though, if your if your
business is being a delivery service for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 20 years and your product is
largely based on California brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still illegal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a company to bring cannabis from one
state to another in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's it's it's hard to know what
the legal path is forward for a big
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's certainly some of the biggest
brands in New York are distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the one of the things I'm looking
forward to most in New York that we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to other guests is that the melting pot of
cultures over there and ideas in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: is like getting nowhere else in the world
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as he said, I'm sure there has to be
some guy who's been growing weed in Brook
[SPEAKER_00]: land or something for the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the greatest weed in the state
and hasn't been able to expand that into a
[SPEAKER_00]: business until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a scenario with they're going
to use, let's say, ECS and HVAC systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's all indoor or is it going to be
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously the climate doesn't
allow for more than one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivations, I'm sure, during the summer
in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's been some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first licenses that were given out
in New York were all for outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were hemp farmers that were allowed
to essentially have like a turnkey
[SPEAKER_01]: solution where they turn their farm
directly into a cannabis farm from a hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: farm because the hemp market had the
bottom fell out for the most part on
[SPEAKER_01]: prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the New York state's process of
legalizing cannabis has been to enable
[SPEAKER_01]: these outdoor growers to convert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you say, the climate here is
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mercurial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's raining and very humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday it was 95 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three days ago it was 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tough if you're a grower and
you're growing outdoors here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity is a notoriously huge problem
with cannabis growth as well, where mold
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes a real problem if you're dealing
with high levels of humidity on an ongoing
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would predict that the biggest
cultivators in New York state will
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually be indoor grows just because
they're able to produce all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really critical for the market is
being able to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in February in New York,
there's nowhere you're growing anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're talking about tomatoes,
tomatoes or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really need to have a facility
that's indoors that enables you to work
[SPEAKER_01]: year round if you want to continue to
satisfy the market in the way that the
[SPEAKER_01]: market demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, in the long term,
I think that we'll still we'll have some
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be some seasonal outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly there's a lot of
benefits to growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plants are outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing as an outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's certainly not a bad thing to want
to prioritize outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that, yeah, New York is a pretty
terrible climate for growing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the long term will definitely
be more indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be a minute before those
those places come online because the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing, again, it just hasn't started
yet for indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the cannabis tourists is
going to be a big, huge market in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we know the state is so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that consumer is going to
want a specific looking and smelling type
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower, which is pretty much going to
be indoor because you can monitor pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control and so many other different
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me this, is there a strain in New
York that's individual?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously, there must be that's
individual to New York that you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen anywhere else in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, is it on a par with the stuff
that you see in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because over in Europe, you hear
California weed is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You very rarely hear Colorado being
mentioned at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be California have gotten the
marketing campaign out done properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All respect to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: California has some tremendous,
tremendous weed growers, some tremendous
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge shout outs to Doja Exclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do some incredible stuff with with
the folks at Wizard Trees, Deep East.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a ton of respect for for the
cultivation world in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the biggest breeders, the
foundation of the current cannabis market,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people who create the genetics that
become the hot strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a lot of those are in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to start with a lot of respect
for California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, it's really important that we
understand that a lot of a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: taste is regional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, for instance, in L.A.,
there's a lot of O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: being smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of of that's like a thought
of as a Southern California strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in New York, you see a lot of
different strains like PIF is a huge name
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sours are a big thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really like like specific New York
strains that we think of are New York sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think of Cuban black haze, which is
PIF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hazes generally are very popular in the
northeast and in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a misnomer to say that
literally any of these strains are from
[SPEAKER_01]: California, are from New York,
are from any of these places, because
[SPEAKER_01]: truly cannabis is not from it's not native
to the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of these are derivatives of land
races from much different places in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world that have very different climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the current strains that we think of
are really these like manufactured
[SPEAKER_01]: designer strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in terms of ones that we associate
with New York, though, like New York City
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel is certainly one of the like
classic New York strains that we think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and PIF is definitely another huge
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing this amazing resurgence
in those recently from if I can just very
[SPEAKER_01]: briefly give a shout out to the folks at
PIF Coast Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some incredibly good PIF that
they've been growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been creating new strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really been some amazing stuff
coming out of the folks at the collector,
[SPEAKER_01]: the collector's stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some really great GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some really great chem dogs and
strains that are like thought of
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally as associated with the
northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that regionality is it's really great
to see those folks standing up and
[SPEAKER_01]: representing the strains that we love here
versus just seeing more gelato or more of
[SPEAKER_01]: the strains that are delicious and
wonderful, but are truly California
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm intrigued.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when are you hosting your growers
competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to be an annual thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be like the Emerald Cup or
how are you formatting the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: competition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to tell you it's going to be
an annual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to ever get ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, it will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is certainly the first annual New
York Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen a lot of success so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm confident that we'll have a second
year and a third year and so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to necessarily directly
compare it to something like the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup or many of the other excellent
cannabis competitions that happen all over
[SPEAKER_01]: America and the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The New York Growers Cup is really
intended to highlight New York growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a competition specifically
among New York growers rather than a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of competitions you see allowing anybody
to enter from all over the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: or even all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But given that we are currently in the
very beginnings of the New York market,
[SPEAKER_01]: the New York Growers Cup is intended to be
like a foundational event, a means of
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighting the best growers here and
connecting them directly to capital,
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to business opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And enabling major companies that want to
enter the New York market to connect with
[SPEAKER_01]: New York's best growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because currently, the way the laws
operate in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of legalization is if you want to
sell weed in New York state legally,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to grow that weed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're a big company,
if you're Cookies or you're the Jungle
[SPEAKER_01]: Boys or any other of these big California
brands that we love, if they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: really enter the New York market,
they need New Yorkers to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a means of connecting
companies like that with New York's best
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you all the best with everything in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing before we go, we've had a
couple of comments actually in previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody wanted to get into working in
the cannabis industry in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there specific sites where they can
view jobs and they can peruse more details
[SPEAKER_00]: of what positions might be available?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there probably are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's almost certainly a
website or a connection board for that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I entered the cannabis market
in New York, the way that I entered the
[SPEAKER_01]: journalism market in New York is by
starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start doing the thing you want to be
doing and and do that as as fast as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference between a journalist
and a civilian is doing journalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only difference between being a
part of the cannabis industry and not is
[SPEAKER_01]: participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be a grower, you should
start learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be a distributor,
you should start talking to distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And figure out how to how to work with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to process hash, you should go
work with hash processors and figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the very baseline, I would say,
without having to invest a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to take a bunch of classes
or whatever, is get on social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis media is largely the cannabis
world, excuse me, is largely on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: and reach out to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of very small growers who
have huge connections just because they
[SPEAKER_01]: were passionate and they reached out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: They reached out through social media and
they got in touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, your passion comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your passion means a lot in any industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's especially so, I think,
in cannabis, where so much of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: is driven by people who are genuinely
passionate about the plant, passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about creating this industry from the
ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, yeah, I would start with
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start with YouTube, look for
growers on YouTube, look for for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are doing stuff there and just
get involved with the community as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to events, talk to people and try to
get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing, great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to check out more,
this is allcaps.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend checking out Ben's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, hopefully we get to have a smoking
person in New York over the next 12 months
[SPEAKER_00]: at some stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you very much for taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would welcome you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I can get you to get you to
Brooklyn to get some great pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh.
