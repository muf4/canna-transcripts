[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Felix Sundstr√∂m, who is the co-founder
[SPEAKER_00]: and CEO at Spectrum Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Felix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking forward to talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some of the most innovative
products on the market, so we hope to give
[SPEAKER_00]: all the audience an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick brief
of the Spectrum Leaf story, how you found
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself in the cannabis industry and how
you found yourself setting up Spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so my background is from tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with Snus product and
oral nicotine products for 15 years prior
[SPEAKER_01]: to coming on board here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came across a brand called Cannadips,
which we found very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Humboldt-based brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mission was then to, as with my
background from the smokeless tobacco in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Scandinavian European markets,
to bring that product into Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we founded Spectrum Leaf and on that
note, we also launched Cannadips.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with some main markets for
smokeless tobacco products, Snus products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which are Scandinavia, but also Germany,
Switzerland, Austria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried to build a distribution network
which has grown ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have 15 markets as of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling the products and then we try
to extend the portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main mission for Spectrum Leaf is
really to bring in new novel type products
[SPEAKER_01]: with a functional focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're focusing on functional delivery
mechanisms, especially within oral
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we launched a brand
called Elabor and then moved to our latest
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you've got a couple of brands
under the umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading about the VOOM Innovation
Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody, that's the R
&D function of the company and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're coming up with the most
innovative products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that is a brand or actually an R
&D company that was founded between myself
[SPEAKER_01]: and Spectrum Leaf and a team of Swedish
snus entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank Svondahl, who's the CEO,
he has quite substantial experience from
[SPEAKER_01]: both production, sales and also
distributing nicotine pouches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But together we founded then the VOOM
Innovation, which is an R&D company based
[SPEAKER_01]: in South of Sweden, which is really
focusing on how to increase and make the
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption in the oral cavity more
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, interesting, because it's great to
see a lot of the time you see people
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up businesses who are just
cannabis focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the most successful brands
that are going to come from this industry
[SPEAKER_00]: of people who have already been
established in other areas, as you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: like tobacco, and they're able to
translate either the consumer want and
[SPEAKER_00]: need into the cannabis industry or utilize
the innovation in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for a new product creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing that yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, my background is with the oral
pouches and we've always seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My view has always been that that is a
very effective way of providing consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: with a smokeless alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oral cavity is a fantastic place to
absorb various different types of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All active substances, not only nicotine,
but in this case, different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and other types of active substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, can you maybe give everybody a brief
view for what is snus and why is it going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be effective in the cannabinoid
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Snus is basically tobacco, moist tobacco,
which you put on your lip and instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: inhaling the tobacco or the nicotine,
you absorb it in the oral cavity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes through the mucus membrane and
then directly into your bloodstream and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can apply that technology to other
types of substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, we believe that by providing
a pouch type product, we don't have to eat
[SPEAKER_01]: and swallow and digest the substance that
you take.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to go through the liver
and and it gets more effective with the
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption in the oral cavity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also it's a very safe and better
alternative to smoking because smoking of
[SPEAKER_01]: today, everyone knows how dangerous it is
and the downsides that come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see for stuff like snus now,
obviously CBD is the big cannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody uses on the market, but do you
see companies starting to blend and
[SPEAKER_00]: formulate different cannabinoids and
terpenes to bring new ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: shall we say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's where a lot of the
big innovation will come over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: five to ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's built the perfect recipe for the
perfect consumption method?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Voodoo Innovation is looking at it every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a team that is very well dedicated
to not only look at CBD, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene profiles are, of course,
super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more than that, different markets
across the globe has different regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the US, for example, you can look
at a very different range of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: to add to the formulation, but also
looking at Europe with many big markets
[SPEAKER_01]: opening up for recreational use and
medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is only the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a lot of the future will be
biosynthesised companies being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: create large scale, clean, pure
ingredients that will be utilised in the
[SPEAKER_00]: CPG and the API side of the industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me this, the novel food application
that you guys have managed to get on the
[SPEAKER_00]: list to be approved, how tiresome and
painstaking was that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it over now that you're on the list
or is it just one hurdle has been
[SPEAKER_00]: completed and there's still a bit of the
journey to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could say that it's over,
but it's of course not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, of course, only for the UK
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also very promising to see how
the FSA has approached this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's taken a lot of time,
we're still making some progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say, you know, because in the
European or in the EU, it's quite
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so this is, as I would view it,
the first step for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still not fully approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think this could at least guide the
consumer in terms of these products are
[SPEAKER_01]: being reviewed and also are hopefully,
when they are approved, will be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, safer to use from a consumer
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think you're right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all boils back again to the
biotechnology companies being able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: up to speed and make these ingredients,
because I think they'll get approved so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly because the technology involved
behind it, where at the moment the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients that people are using,
the people who are giving the license are
[SPEAKER_00]: still not crystal clear on the exact
purity and strength of each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the novel food application,
as I said, that's just the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of people getting carried
away thinking that the novel food gives
[SPEAKER_00]: them the key to the Golden Gate or
whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the UK market you guys see as being a
home for your products or are you guys a
[SPEAKER_00]: global company where this is just the
first step in the stage for you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for sure the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also UK, the FSA has been pushing
this agenda and also been very clear on
[SPEAKER_01]: towards us as a company what to do and
what is required of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EU has not really reached that point
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have submitted an application for
the EU, but still no feedback and no
[SPEAKER_01]: results so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would of course like to get our
product registered and tested as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible in order to ensure the consumers
that are safe to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and speaking of testing there,
do you see there is an ample amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing facilities in the EU?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the UK or in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that's where there's still
a lack of real capital and real technology
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the labs that are able to actually
test products at a pretty high speed
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to, let's say, the government
agencies and labs that are currently doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what one of course could wish for is a
universal standard, SOP for all the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always get the same results because
as of today, the bigger, more established
[SPEAKER_01]: labs, they don't have that much experience
in testing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also then you have in parallel,
you have smaller, more cannabis driven
[SPEAKER_01]: labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they maybe don't in all cases have the
same SOPs and testing in the same ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't test in the same ways,
you will not be able to compare the
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is something that is very,
very important for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only for the consumer safety,
but also from a regulatory perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you're looking at THC levels,
you need to ensure that there's no THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC trade seems to be the the handcuff
that's holding a lot of brands back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that comes from, as you said,
different labs are testing at different
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities and that doesn't give clarity
to the brands and products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the election over in Great
Britain having any sway on the end result
[SPEAKER_00]: of the novel food?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see your man, Rushy Sunak, coming out
and saying he's against all drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to punish everybody who used
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your one Lidz Trust seems to be more
open to a cannabis industry growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do think, though, that the UK has
shown until now that they are a
[SPEAKER_01]: progressive, quite liberal market and open
to have safe and regulated products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to politics,
it's, of course, impossible to for say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just have to monitor the situation
and see what comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to to apply by the
guidelines that are for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see Brexit as a hindrance to the UK
market growth, or do you think it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing for them that the cannabis
companies in Britain will actually be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to supply the British industry,
that there won't be much competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you own companies that do
business with the UK at the moment in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, it's a fucking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things take like twice as long,
the tax on top of all the orders that come
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's going to end up
hindering the industry long term,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you think it's going to cocoon it
and allow the UK companies to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate their own home territory?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I'm not an expert in this
field, but my view would be that because
[SPEAKER_01]: what we saw when Brexit happened is that
it created a lot of issues and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, many companies had to basically
cut down or wasn't able to sell to the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: at all because of the complexity and also
that you didn't really know what rules
[SPEAKER_01]: applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we have seen at least an
improvement over the last years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over long term, of course,
the UK will be a huge business partner to
[SPEAKER_01]: the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they will find ways to smoothen
this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, it would have been much
easier if Brexit wouldn't have occurred,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a quick jump around Europe now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you're from up in the Nordic
area of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the Nordics still being pretty
severe on CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked to a couple of guys from Finland
and different areas, whereas it almost
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like CBD is considered a class A
narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that loosening over a degree,
or is there a separate strategy in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different states in that part of Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we will see a different
regulatory frameworks for different
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: From different countries, Finland,
Norway, but also Sweden, to some extent,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had a fairly, the view has been that
CBD is maybe not a narcotic, but more a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical type product, and it should be
regulated from the medical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a few verdicts also from the
courts in Sweden, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think over time, when we see markets
like Germany and bigger trade markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: trade countries for the Scandinavian
markets opening up, and EU also being very
[SPEAKER_01]: open, with the same or similar type of
regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think over time, this will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think Scandinavia is more
conservative, for sure, than the southern
[SPEAKER_01]: European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will take time to get a clear
framework in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But long term, cannabis and CBD,
for sure, is here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we all got our fingers
crossed that Germany executes their new
[SPEAKER_00]: industry perfectly, and that the capital
generated from tax and whatnot is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: an example to the rest of the European
countries, and that we can hopefully ride
[SPEAKER_00]: in the jet stream of how the German
industry takes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all need to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a sprint by any stretch of the
imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have thick skin, the ability
to learn all sorts of topics in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got into cannabis thinking it's
going to be fun, you'll end up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree in biotechnology, or in physics,
or in chemistry, or something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: some special tag that you didn't even
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felix, it's been great chatting to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just hit our time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you're looking forward
to over the next 12 months in the European
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry that the audience should
know about?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean for us specifically or in
general?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but we're very excited about the
launch of the Boon products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some new things with Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're launching a few new products there
as well, but also for our brand Elivar
[SPEAKER_01]: with all strips that we're going to extend
the product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of things coming on,
and then we're also looking to some
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting products for the US market as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is an exciting time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we look forward to keeping track of
the Spectrum Leaf story.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody who wants to know more about
the products from Spectrum Leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: the website is there below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend going and checking them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some of the most innovative
products on the market at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Felix, thank you very much for taking
the time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
