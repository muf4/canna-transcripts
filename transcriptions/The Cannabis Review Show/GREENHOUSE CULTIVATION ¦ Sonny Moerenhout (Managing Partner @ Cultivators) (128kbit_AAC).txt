[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking all things
greenhouse cultivation today and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: delighted to be joining the episode by
Sonny Murenhout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonny is the managing partner at Cultivars
and he's been a consultant for growers for
[SPEAKER_00]: years who are growing cannabis cultivation
in countries where medicinal cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonny holds a master's degree in plant
science with greenhouse horticulture as a
[SPEAKER_00]: specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no better man to be able to give us all
the information that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: needing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Sonny?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite busy with projects all around
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump straight into everything
and get into the kind of first topic that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to give everybody a little
overview of Dutch cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe break down for everybody
what's going on with the cafes at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment in terms of supply and what are the
exciting things happening in Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so of course, like everybody knows
that Holland is a special country
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding cannabis use and cultivation of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's tolerated for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, a couple of years ago,
government decided to start up a coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shop experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a closed chain experiment
where they will select, and already they
[SPEAKER_01]: did, 10 growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are going to supply 10 municipalities
in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of cities like Breda,
Tilburg, or in the north, Arnhem,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nijmegen, they will be into this
experiment and the growers will supply all
[SPEAKER_01]: the coffee shops in these 10
municipalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually the base of the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's set up for four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers were selected already some time
ago in December 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, all of the 10 have been gone
through the BIBOP procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the legal check, the background
of the people involved and the background
[SPEAKER_01]: of the money involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now actually all the 10, some already
building the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are busy with building permissions,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, hopefully the first facilities
will go live end of the year or early next
[SPEAKER_01]: year, and that we finally get the supply
to the coffee shops somewhere Q2 or
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter three in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has taken quite a few years,
but hopefully this experiment,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is actually the first country in
Europe then with the legalization as an
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment of recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the whole story around the
coffee shop experiment in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you basically confirm, so for the
last couple of decades or so, has the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain been coming from the black
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the coffee shops, it was legal for them
to sell the product, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they get the product from,
nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is, a lot of people thought it is
legalized in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's decriminalized and actually it's
tolerated to sell the products in the
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shop, but indeed supply comes from,
yeah, the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some people with decades of
experience of cultivation who have got a
[SPEAKER_00]: head start on everybody else in that
territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either been different strains or are
they all going to grow a universal,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate using Indicant Sativa, but are they
both going to grow those two profiles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the government has set a special
timeframe when they are setting up that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get cannabis genetics from
wherever they want to get in as a gray
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get a time slot that they can get,
for example, tissue culture in or seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: clones from whatever place to start up
the, actually the cultivation and do their
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar hunting, phenotype hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that is still a little bit
vague.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that is a little bit like the
Dutch government.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things still need to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be set in paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that is everything around the
recreational side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's maybe zoom in also to the medicinal
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the recreational aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking to the medicinal cannabis in the
Netherlands and the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we had for many years,
Bader Kan, the only Dutch legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: grower who was actually growing for the
Dutch government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Dutch government was selling all
their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they actually, we sometimes say they
act in a golden prison because yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: supply is arranged, but they just need to
supply what the government is looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is now a tender where five
parties are still involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have already handed in their
first batches to show that they can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality cannabis according to specs
which the government has given to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully later this year or maybe next
year, we get some more understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: those five companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will select for now, what we know is
that they will select two parties out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the five companies still in the race to
get into this tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kind of stranglehold that has been
there has been lifted now with an open
[SPEAKER_00]: tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that's going to get more
competitive as the open markets come to
[SPEAKER_00]: fruition and more people start getting
into this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of Dutch cannabis, you guys have
such a strong floral cultivation scene
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed up in Denmark,
they've got their ornamental flower scene
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's been translated into a cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see some of the, let's say major
players in the flower world putting their
[SPEAKER_00]: finger into this industry and maybe
setting up a subsidiary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, because it was such a tender
process and also a bit of, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shop experiment, a lottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually, the growers who wanted to get
in from the Horty cultural site actually
[SPEAKER_01]: missed their ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a combination now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some growers are in in a different way
into the experiment, but it's some had a
[SPEAKER_01]: look into it, but there's also a little
bit of fear because of the background of
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually at this moment,
a mixture of true investors and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of Horty culturalists into this
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the next topic
now, the main part of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's something you've got a lot of
expertise in and studied in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
overview of the amount of facets and
[SPEAKER_00]: components that are involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think first of all, it all starts with
the question, who are you going to supply
[SPEAKER_01]: your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: So who is your customer and what are the
requirements for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on that, you can make your
decision in your design of your facility
[SPEAKER_01]: because it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're supplying to actually the
recreational market with dry flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're supplying to a pharmaceutical
company, which actually they are really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking into an API and active
pharmaceutical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on that, you can make the most
important decisions with your greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: or indoor facility because yeah,
that is actually the first choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to grow cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking into an indoor without
daylight situation or traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe a semi-closed greenhouse,
which is actually getting more popular
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world for medicinal cannabis
because it gives the combination of the
[SPEAKER_01]: two other options, indoor and traditional,
and yeah, the most of the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe zooming in into indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor is of course, like people say,
the highest degree of environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: control, but you need to look at also all
the cap X and OPEX aspects because you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to install more lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need an HVAC system, CO2 supply,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will lead to an higher ecological
footprint versus a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to forget about labor efficiencies
because you work with smaller rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has an effect on your labor
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking to the greenhouse, important
element is of course that you need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: blackout screens because you need to be
able to go from long days in vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: phase to short days in the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, 1% of light can really kill your
crop because plants get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative state again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something to really keep in
mind to go for high quality solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: which enable you to grow high quality
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: High quality products.
[SPEAKER_01]: A greenhouse has a smaller ecological
footprint because you can use free energy
[SPEAKER_01]: from the sun, heat, and light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in total, you can save on installing
costs regarding lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lights, LEDs, or HPS, that's not a
major decision you need to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much light are you gonna put into a
greenhouse or indoor facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the intensity, but also spectrum,
type of light, like I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: LED or Sonti because a big difference
between LED and Sonti is the extra heat
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonti will generate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which of course you need to get rid
of in your growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is another important factor you
should look into regarding your facility
[SPEAKER_01]: design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so basically maybe, can you answer
the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people, we've already
talked to some people from Portugal and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got a great climate for growing
outdoor, but how many yields per year
[SPEAKER_00]: would they be able to get compared to an
indoor facility that may have a full HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: system, an ECS system, some technically
trained staff who know how to work the
[SPEAKER_00]: software and have designed a bespoke grow
operation perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you think is gonna bring out a
better yield and a better product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's also, again, the question,
who are you growing for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor production is possible,
maybe for the extraction market,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you look to the dry flower market,
yeah, then I think you should look into a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the only choices you have
because to get high quality, you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to steer your environment and get
the climate settings and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: microclimate you need for your plants to
optimum perform and to get the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that, you need tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is, I think, a straightforward
answer for highest quality dry flower
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this needs to be done in a protected
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where you can control every second
of the environment, the pest control and
[SPEAKER_00]: the production model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because that is interesting that you
mentioned that pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This group, for sure, it is a no brainer
that you cannot use any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything you do should be biological
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that is way easier in a
controlled environment than in outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: production because you never know what
your neighbor is spraying and which can
[SPEAKER_01]: affect actually your production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also a higher risk to grow
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whatever way the wind blows can
determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been all over the place now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I kind of see the industry in
Europe taking shape is that we've already
[SPEAKER_00]: got a strong farming tradition over here
and that some people are going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: their fingers to this industry and create
a whole new genetics brands that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: comparable to what's going on in the
States at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the North American companies
actually being able to penetrate Europe or
[SPEAKER_00]: do you see the entrepreneurs and the new
companies in Europe being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: withstand, let's say, a takeover by the
North American companies coming into your
[SPEAKER_00]: market and taking up all the contracts,
which we see some of them trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with terrible products and consequences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I agree with you that we
have seen an influx of North American
[SPEAKER_01]: capital trying to get into this market in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: On one hand, they succeeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, also, we have seen all
the failures in the industry and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it will in the end, it will be a
combination of because setting up a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis facility requires big pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something the North American
companies are much better in than European
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look to the history of green
exotic culture and growing, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: is a strong asset of the North West
European countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is where our core competences are
as Netherlands, the UK, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be a combination of the growing
habits of the people over here together
[SPEAKER_01]: with probably an influx of money from
North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most important is to deliver high
quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about that and to get finally a
return on investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that, you can only spend your
money once so make sure you make the
[SPEAKER_01]: correct decisions in your facility design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also like to get into projects from
the first moment they are starting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the business plan, business ID,
because then you can really shape the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen too many projects where
people already started and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and started growing with not
the right climate systems or growing
[SPEAKER_01]: methods and changing that around is again
a cost factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have seen companies failing on that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely great talking to you.
