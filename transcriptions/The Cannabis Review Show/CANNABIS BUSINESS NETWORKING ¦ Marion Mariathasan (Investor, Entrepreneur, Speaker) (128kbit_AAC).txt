[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Marian Maria Tason and he is an investor,
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneur and speaker in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Marian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well Ian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a pretty stellar career from
creating tequila brands and being an
[SPEAKER_00]: investor across a multitude of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to start with you
entering into the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 and what opportunities you saw and
how the journey has gone so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you for this chance to kind of
tell my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so as you mentioned,
got into the cannabis industry back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a law firm called Vicente
Cedarburg, really well known in the US as
[SPEAKER_01]: they helped with legalization of cannabis
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they've been working with other
states, but also private companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the three partners I knew from
beforehand and they were trying to solve
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the biggest hurdles as more
licenses were being handed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the challenge of ensuring
operational compliance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every state in the US has
different sets of laws and even down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the municipality level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea was to create some sort of
software that helped licensed operators
[SPEAKER_01]: streamline and create efficiencies to
essentially stay compliant to all those
[SPEAKER_01]: changing regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was my kind of entree into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was back in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started Simplified a year after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then having been in the space,
more opportunities were popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I turned into also an investor and
advisor and board member in a multitude of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a very, very successful
journey for you so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to kind of touch on the three big
companies that you've been a part on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we'll start with Ceylon
Solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the offering that this company
brings to the cannabis industry and why
[SPEAKER_00]: has it been so successful to date?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the Ceylon Solutions is actually one
of my oldest companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I founded it back in 2005, officially in
2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a software dev company,
US based, but the engineers are in Sri
[SPEAKER_01]: Lanka.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, obviously it's been
around for quite some time helping
[SPEAKER_01]: startups but also larger companies save
costs on their development, software
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got into the cannabis industry,
we saw a lot of need also for new
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies that were being built.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just by the fact that I'm now the
chairman of the company, I don't actively
[SPEAKER_01]: run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started kind of pointing out
opportunities to the executive team at
[SPEAKER_01]: Ceylon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in short order,
all of a sudden they were developing
[SPEAKER_01]: software products for some really big
brands, not brands, companies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: well known in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they continue to do so today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really what I think sets
Ceylon apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now in today's environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether you're a startup or a
seasoned tech company and you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to build products that serve the cannabis
industry, there's a lot of terminology and
[SPEAKER_01]: nuances that's, you know, very different
in cannabis versus other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this company and the team behind it
has a lot of experience having built
[SPEAKER_01]: products, including Simplifya,
you know, the compliance company that I
[SPEAKER_01]: run as a CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's what's made it so
successful so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're opening up, you know,
an office in Barcelona this month,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to expand into Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the next company that I
wanted to discuss, which is Simplifya,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a compliance and regulation
software provider, which your expertise in
[SPEAKER_00]: computer science, this seemed to be one of
the most advantageous sectors within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry that people could
develop unique solutions for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that an easy step from Ceylon
Solutions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is everything going so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Simplifya, I have to say,
so in all the companies I've started and
[SPEAKER_01]: founded and run in the past, this has been
probably the most challenging,
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily because I think the cannabis
industry is still very early, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the U.S., it's, you know,
there's 40 states that's not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously no federal, it's not
legal on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it's so early, just lots of
challenges in terms of creating product
[SPEAKER_01]: that helps not only licensed operators,
but, you know, we now have products for
[SPEAKER_01]: banks, for insurance companies,
for law firms, even governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are newer products that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the initial product was very
challenging, just trying to understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew what the needs were going to be,
but really, how do you price it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the industry was changing so
much, Ian, we had to keep adapting in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very rapid pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that to say, you know, Simplifya
now is the leader and the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: operational compliance company in the
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have anyone that competes with us
kind of the depth and breadth of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've finally found kind of our firm
footing and we continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the future looks quite
optimistic and, you know, we might even
[SPEAKER_01]: become coming into Europe and other parts
of the world as they legalize,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's an incredible success story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now moving on to the third company I want
to just go to, which is LeafWire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a global networking platform for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe explain why you thought this
was a great opportunity and the success
[SPEAKER_00]: that the platform is having today for
anybody who wants to check out more,
[SPEAKER_00]: the website is below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LeafWire is what we call the LinkedIn
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, I think LeafWire was founded
about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that we recognized was that
traditional social networks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So even on LinkedIn, now you can have a
profile, you can post for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: some aspects of cannabis and it's not an
issue, other social media as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we felt like the cannabis industry,
and when I say we as a board member and an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor, it felt like there was a need
for a vertical or social network.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was dedicated purely to cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's constantly, it's growing,
not just in the US and Canada and other
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt like knowledge can be shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can connect with other people that
are, you know, very specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, LeafWire at this point,
I think is about 75,000 users from around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, you know, primarily a lot in
North America, but they certainly have
[SPEAKER_01]: users from other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it encompasses not just people
within the industry, like operators,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a great ecosystem and
LeafWire continues to evolve and add
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've got a conference app that
they're going to be rolling out and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from jobs to marketing,
just all those things that you see on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media and sites like LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been very, very proud of what
they've done at LeafWire as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now being able to incorporate all
those multitude of options for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is definitely a great route to be
taken and definitely an advantageous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask your opinion on this
proposed rescheduling to Schedule 3 in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really think that this is going to
happen with the Biden administration?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, do you think it's going to be a
month or will it wait till the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year when the elections are on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the billion dollar question,
Ian, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've heard, you know,
the government and Capitol Hill say a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think this time around, it is very
different for multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it's an election year, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're always seeing a lot more
activity coming out of the White House and
[SPEAKER_01]: Capitol Hill for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, you know, the Biden
administration asked HHS, which is Health
[SPEAKER_01]: and Human Services, last year to take a
look at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recommended that cannabis be
rescheduled to Schedule 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if I recall correctly,
they made the recommendation to the DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, it lies with the DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But historically, I don't think DEA has
not ever taken a recommendation from HHS,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is a lot of optimism because
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think from all indications,
you know, I hear it's going to happen in a
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear it's going to happen by the end of
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect it's going to be somewhere in
between, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no one has the crystal ball,
unfortunately, Ian.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and I think, you know, many people in
the industry are a little, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: tired of hearing like, hey, this is going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, all indications are that it is
on track and it will happen this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to take a, you know,
guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel the possibility with
especially if you go on to, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the MSO investor platforms or some
of the retail people that you can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're beaten down over a number of
years of promises and nobody wants to get
[SPEAKER_00]: their hopes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully it's coming around in April
from what we can hear as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm seeing a lot more
activity picking up even not just from
[SPEAKER_01]: investors, but companies that have been on
the sidelines and that have been watching
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry waiting for the right time
and opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you saw, but one of the
things like the 10th largest bank in
[SPEAKER_01]: America called First Citizens,
they just announced about two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks ago that they're now going to
start getting into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a 200 billion dollar bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've seen we've had inquiries
from all sorts of different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: companies from alcohol to you name it,
that are all kicking the tires and really
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to take the cannabis industry
more seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more so because they're seeing
that there is a path to legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: that's starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, of course, has gotten everyone
very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us at Simplify, you know,
some of the biggest private equity names
[SPEAKER_01]: you can think of, you know, Dave,
we feel we're fielding a lot of inbounds
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, just people wanting to
understand where we're going and where the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is going, because, you know,
there's a lot of money sitting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sidelines trying waiting to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to finish up, I've got a bit of a
full neck question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multiple choice answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're an investor, let's say we give
you 50 million dollars and you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: choice of investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a biotech company that uses
fermentation engineering to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the cannabinoids as APIs apply
pharmaceutical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a nationwide chain of retail
stores that we could develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a cultivation facility with
edibles and drinks attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of these three options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is get near 50 million dollars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think if I had my way,
I would probably pay some money in all
[SPEAKER_01]: three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably more of not the answer
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's why, because I think all three
of those companies are touching on some
[SPEAKER_01]: really key areas for the industry as it
continues to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got an investment in a CBD
company out of the UK, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I did a few years ago, Canterray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I've invested in plant
touching to CBD to tech companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it all comes down to
execution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think all these different
areas have to coexist to make the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: blossom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't, I'm more of a person that
kind of I think hedges the bets and puts
[SPEAKER_01]: it in multiple areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I would do it, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best answer,
because there are definitely different
[SPEAKER_00]: sectors that have different launch
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That look like they could all be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man,
and I'm not going to keep it too much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say thank you very much for
your time, Marion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who want to check out more about
LeafWire, the social networking app,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend going over and signing
up to the platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for now, Marion, thank you very much
for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on the show and look
forward to chatting with you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
