[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis View.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by fellow
Irishman on this episode, legal expert
[SPEAKER_00]: Niall Nelligan.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today and now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very well and thank you for having me
on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have an international
cannabis law expert on the show and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe focus a couple of things on the
Irish industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to maybe give everybody an
overview of your position in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you got to where you are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so by way of background,
I'm a barrister by profession.
[SPEAKER_01]: I qualified in 1999 and practiced for 14
years in the Dublin Eastern Circuit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've also been an academic lawyer for
the last 23 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in around 2013, as academics do,
I was looking for a new research field and
[SPEAKER_01]: the area of drug policy, regulation and
law reform immediately kind of sprung to
[SPEAKER_01]: mind and piqued my interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose what kind of entered me into
the industry, I suppose like many lawyers,
[SPEAKER_01]: was being in court one day and seeing a
young man being prosecuted for possession
[SPEAKER_01]: of a small amount of cannabis,
in this case was about 22 euro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember looking at the judge and
looking at the other lawyers in the court
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of feeling a certain amount of
unease about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question kind of piqued my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is cannabis prohibited?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really started a journey which
coincided, I suppose, with the movement in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States principally in
Washington and Colorado by way of popular
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot initiatives to regulate cannabis
for our use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it started with this question of
why, it went back to the origins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it discovered that cannabis has been
subject to international controls really
[SPEAKER_01]: since the Second Opium Convention in 1925
under the O League of Nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the curious thing about it was that
cannabis was not in fact on the agenda as
[SPEAKER_01]: the title of the actual convention was
opium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a dispute between the United
States and the United Kingdom over opium
[SPEAKER_01]: controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was into this kind of gap that this
Islamic fundamentalist and Egyptian
[SPEAKER_01]: diplomat by the name of Mohammed al-Gwindi
sort of put Indian hemp on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was coming from that Islamic point
of view of any intoxicant is bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly the use of hashish in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was also an ulterior motive
because Indian hemp, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: was a major competitor to Egypt's cash
crop, which was, of course, cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by kind of exploiting this dispute
between the United States and Britain,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis ended up being subject to
international controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by virtue of that, the United Kingdom
introduced the Dangerous Drugs Act of
[SPEAKER_01]: 1928.
[SPEAKER_01]: The British Medical Association worked out
against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by extension, in Ireland in 1934.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we move to the United States
and we see how it really is an
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprising bureaucrat by the name of
Harry Ainslinger, who works in the Federal
[SPEAKER_01]: Bureau of Narcotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's seeking to effectively build an
empire for himself in the area of drug
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ceases upon the use of marijuana,
which is popularly used in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States among, I suppose, Mexicans at the
time and African-Americans in Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ainslinger was racist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by using marijuana to kind of platform
him himself, he built this empire of drug
[SPEAKER_01]: control and prolonged his career,
which really went up until the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was one of the primary architects
of international cannabis prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: most notably the Single Narcotics Drugs
Convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, by virtue of that,
the United States weigh in behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nixon administration introducing the
Controlled Substances Act 1971.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, as part of their policy,
in other words, good policy, but bad
[SPEAKER_01]: policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really seized upon the likes of LSD,
the psychedelics, cannabis in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a political stick to, I suppose,
beat their opponents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see the war on drugs kicking off in
the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been reiterated by the Reagan
administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have is this prohibition,
which, of course, outsources, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivation, distribution,
sale of cannabis really to organize crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see around 2012, 2013 is really
the beginning of the end of this
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition cycle that really has been
with us for almost a century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I became particularly
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, how you transition
something from prohibition to regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great overview for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, first topic I wanted to
jump into with is the argument for legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see tomorrow that the Justice Committee
are having a meeting on personal
[SPEAKER_00]: possession at 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the main factor that
politicians should be looking at when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about legal cannabis in
Ireland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it taxation, jobs, social equity,
removing the catch from the drug dealers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the primary reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I think the focus of the Justice
Committee tomorrow is largely on the area
[SPEAKER_01]: of decriminalization for, I suppose,
the major controlled drugs, whether we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about heroin, cocaine,
psychedelics, cannabis, LSD, the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are typically used for recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But decriminalization is really just
prohibition like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to what happened in the
United States under alcohol prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, you can possess it,
you can consume it, but you can not
[SPEAKER_01]: produce or sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So decriminalization is part of the
overall scheme of harm reduction measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that in itself is a good thing,
particularly for those with problematic
[SPEAKER_01]: drug use who the criminal justice system
has penalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of how I would approach the
subject, I see cannabis is slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we need is really is a customized
approach to dealing with these different
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And regulation is really the one that best
suits cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the era of global cannabis
prohibition is coming to an end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer a question of countries
like Ireland regulating cannabis for what
[SPEAKER_01]: we call adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just a question of when and
how we go about it is perhaps the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that we must consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, what we have is an
unregulated illicit market which affords
[SPEAKER_01]: no protection to those who choose to
consume cannabis for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: their own use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who are self-medicating would come
outside the scope of our very restrictive
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis access program,
most notably people who are suffering from
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose inevitably you're going to
get teenagers who are experimenting with
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of soft drugs, whether it's MDMA
or ecstasy, or indeed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's not an ideal situation because
no drug is made safer in the hands of
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal gangs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the responsible way to approach this is
neither prohibition doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_01]: the penalization of people who use it,
decriminalization allows organized crime
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue supplying a market while not
prosecuting people for use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the sensible approach is then,
well, why not sit down, design a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory model which provides for
product safety from seed to sales so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can oversee the process and design it
in such a way that we protect public
[SPEAKER_01]: health better than a system which is
unregulated and illicit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a point of observation,
supposing you have a 17 year old child who
[SPEAKER_01]: is experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this moment in time, there are no
controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, all this person has to do
is to know where to buy, where to buy and
[SPEAKER_01]: have the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ID requirements, there's no
product safety, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, when we're talking about adults,
it's a better situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would prefer a better situation where
you have dispensaries, cultivators who are
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed, subject to product control,
safety, and all the sort of things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: would associate with, I suppose,
agricultural products, food products,
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, beverages, and indeed tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the preferred and the better
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what has happened in 19 states
in the United States and increasingly more
[SPEAKER_01]: countries starting with Uruguay in 2013,
Canada in 2018, South Africa, Georgia,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico coming on stream, Malta in 2021,
and obviously in the next year and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, the largest country in the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the domino effect kicks
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, we will then see other
countries in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely we're looking at Luxembourg,
we're looking at Belgium, the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_01]: has moved towards a licensing system.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of cultivation, they had a
decriminalized model since 1976.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the problems with
decriminalization were obvious there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will see France, Italy,
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a question of if Ireland
regulates cannabis route use, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: question of when.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than put it on the long finger,
the incrementalist approach which I think
[SPEAKER_01]: our conservative political establishment
are, I suppose, attempting to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should go about it in a more
pragmatic, consistent fashion and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: what Germany has done over the last number
of weeks by having hearings with over 200
[SPEAKER_01]: witnesses, designing the legislation which
should come on board in the next six
[SPEAKER_01]: months, and then having a regulation
market up and running by early 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the preferred route to go
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that basically outlines the argument
for legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question I want to ask is the
politics against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a case of senior civil servants in
the Department of Health and a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership in all of the main political
parties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a kickback from one specific
area, do you think, or do you think nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: just wants to take this ball and run with
it with the fear?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of factors here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most politicians who I've had an
opportunity to talk to are quite pragmatic
[SPEAKER_01]: and they understand the arguments in
favour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're just taking their
time without going about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to make any huge jumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's political conservatism.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a small and very vocal group
within the medical profession who have
[SPEAKER_01]: been extremely active in, I suppose,
putting forward the argument of reefer
[SPEAKER_01]: madness, something which stems back to the
1930s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Propagated by Ainslinger and his pals in
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting thing was the American
Medical Association and the British
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical Association back in the 1930s were
totally against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of politicians, I suppose,
in every single party within the Iraqis,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are those who favor regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is this element of, I suppose,
the spectre of our conservative past.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the conservative tale kind
of wagging the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Ireland is a far more progressive
country, as we have seen in recent
[SPEAKER_01]: referendums such as the same sex,
such as abortion and other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if this was a matter that
actually went to a public vote,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, not a constitutional issue,
I don't think there'd be any doubt about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The overwhelming majority of the Irish
public would probably vote in favour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But however, it is a matter of
parliamentary legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, there are conservative
elements within the civil service.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not to be judged.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are conservatives within the major
political parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they are starting to open up
and see what is happening and realizing
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's only a matter of when,
not a question of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, very well put.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last question, actually,
just when we were talking about it there,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you see a case where basically the next
topic I wanted to discuss, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of cases basically against the DOH
and somewhere against the DPP basically on
[SPEAKER_00]: the sale of CBD products in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a scenario within the next 12
months where there will be CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries selling flour to the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a real possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those matters are, of course, subject to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really can't comment on precisely
what the outcomes of this case will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there is a possibility for some of
the jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this in Greece, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, you can make the extension that
this will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, of course, challenges for,
I suppose, policing because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it's very difficult to make a
distinction between raw hemp flour and,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, you know, cannabis,
the high THC components.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a slow process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there is an argument that really
we should have legislation governing CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see any impetus from any of
the governing parties at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's something that can be put out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to know on your last topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, to legalise cannabis in
Ireland, this can't be brought for a vote
[SPEAKER_00]: by the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be done internally and in the
realm of politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is correct, of course, because
Ireland is a signatory to the single
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotics drug conventions of the amending
conventions, psychotropic conventions,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our law governing drugs controls is
the misuse of drugs act.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1977, which is effectively a copy largely
of the 1971 act in the in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is exclusively a matter for the
artists to legislate for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is nothing to actually preclude
the law practice from passing a bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that bill can put something to a
public plebiscite or public vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not precluded by our law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't necessarily mean that that
would be binding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like a reference than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I don't see that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That some parliamentarians don't tend to
like to give away their sole power.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sole power of theoraptists is,
of course, to make law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The executive is, of course, to implement
that law, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a doubt there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing we've seen over the
last number of years is, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: the creation of these citizens'
assemblies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The argument is, well, isn't a parliament
a citizens' assembly?
[SPEAKER_01]: To begin with, why are you outsourcing
this to other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a very popular model at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I think they've kind of kicked
the can down a little bit into next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is an assembly that will listen
to the whole issues about
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that Canada's
regulation should form part of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in the experts from the likes of
Canara, who is, of course, the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: body in the likes of the United States,
where these are the people who are civil
[SPEAKER_01]: servants who deal with it on a day-to-day
basis on the regulated basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have phenomenal expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can tell you the mistakes that
were made initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: The successes and the way forward to
making this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, regulation takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the object of regulation, of course,
is twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, one would have to say we
want to remove organized crime from the
[SPEAKER_01]: equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, you do want to protect
public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, we have the worst of all
worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this prohibition that doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this feels organized crime and no
drugs made safer to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, all the kind of extreme
sort of things that can happen with any
[SPEAKER_01]: bad product in the market happens under
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regulation is the root four.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing before I let you go is,
can you explain to everybody what the
[SPEAKER_00]: INCBA is and the great role that they have
in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the INCBA is the representative body
for lawyers who work in the regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry and relation industry,
such as the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was founded in 2015 by three women
lawyers in Bartling, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then subsequently joined by Mary
Shapiro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's driven by women, which is very
interesting and has grown to over a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand lawyers in the United States and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a body of representative
lawyers providing advice, assistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: education for lawyers who work in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very important because as the
industry grows in the regulation markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's for travel use, whether it's
for medical use, whether it's industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and the related products that come
with this, you need experienced lawyers
[SPEAKER_01]: who know this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you mention cannabis law to people,
they sort of look at you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: strangely, particularly in our own
profession.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have to remind them that this
is black letter law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dealing with everything from
international law, European law,
[SPEAKER_01]: medical law, pharmaceutical law,
drug policy, regulation, licensing,
[SPEAKER_01]: trans actions, product, liability,
mergers and acquisitions, and so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why you need experienced
lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why the INCBA exists,
to provide the education, the resources
[SPEAKER_01]: for those who are in the area,
and obviously to develop academic programs
[SPEAKER_01]: at the colleges and universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're already largely in existence
in the United States, in Harvard,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Yale, in many of the Ivy League
schools, Northwestern, Vanderbilt and
[SPEAKER_01]: Rutgers, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my job is kind of to assist that
process in developing academic programs in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States and in Europe,
but also as a member of the International
[SPEAKER_01]: Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we're all out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to you all day now,
and it's been great information that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been able to pass on to me and to
the audience as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll get to have a part two to
this conversation towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year, and hopefully we'll see some sort of
movement to a degree in the Irish
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, listen, thank you very much Owen for
taking the time to interview me this
[SPEAKER_01]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to coming back and
talking with you on other topics in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Bye.
