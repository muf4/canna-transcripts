[SPEAKER_00]: This will bring you some great information
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join you in this episode
by Dr. Shake Shack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a co-founder of the medical director
and South African pioneer in the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: international medical cannabis research .
[SPEAKER_00]: medical professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Shiksha?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a wealth of information that
I'm sure the audience is going to love to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you found yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: in the medical cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was actually from the vaccine
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working at Wits Health Consortium
and I was involved in the HIV vaccine
[SPEAKER_01]: study and very reputable clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought, you know, there must
be some other information about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what's about plant medicines
instead of pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was invited to some information
on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just fell in love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw about the healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned so much more about the plant
and the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what I love about it,
you never stop learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like every day there's something
about the plant that you learn with the
[SPEAKER_01]: different cannabinoid profiles,
the APIs, the terpenes, helping and
[SPEAKER_01]: treating patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since then, I've left the
pharmaceutical side from the vaccine
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and dialed straight into the
clinical trials with regards to medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and other natural plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going through your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty much I was like,
right, even this interview, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to mention every single thing
that you've been a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems very, very accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is break it into
two topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first topic I want to talk about was
patient access in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we know Medical Cannabis Access
Programme is a worldwide start off with
[SPEAKER_00]: splotters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few countries that have been
able to implement one successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe tell the audience of what
the patient access looks like in South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, who prescribes it, where they
obtain the products from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start with the first part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the South African government actually
decriminalized medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is they allowed private
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patients are allowed to grow it in
their own yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a private space and make their own
medicines or oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not allowed to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they allowed about 1.2 kgs per
household or 600 grams per person,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what the first access that
happened in about 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the medical cannabis was introduced
and it was legislated as a schedule six
[SPEAKER_01]: for tetrahydrocannabinol, your THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your CBD is a schedule for the
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the access right now currently is the
only way we can access it for patients is
[SPEAKER_01]: the Section 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means, Ian, is basically a
patient has to go to a doctor and the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor will have to apply for a Section
21, which means it's unregistered
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once that application goes through,
you will have to make a motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you prescribing this for the
patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the patient has palliative care and the
morphine or opioids are not working,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can say this is the reason why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And goes through SAPRA, which stands for
South African Health Products Regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: Authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would then approve it and then the
patient will then get that medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is quite a lot of work for the
doctor to do because it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is how the process is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the access is very limited,
but there are going to be medicines that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be rolled out very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have actually put in dossiers three
years ago for the first medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines to be registered in South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're quite far down the line with SAPRA
with the dossiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will happen then, Owen, once that's
medicine gets registered, then any doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: then can then prescribe these medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to go under the Section 21
process, which is very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as it stands, access limited from a
doctor perspective to a patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are allowed to grow it and have
access to it privately.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are products like Epidiolex available
for patients in South Africa or is their
[SPEAKER_00]: own brand version?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing, nothing as yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epidiolex is not even available in South
Africa as yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there isn't actually any.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that we're currently using on the
Section 21 are from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like your Hexo or your TGOD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the ones that are currently
in the Section 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's also happening is some of the SAPRA
license facilities are also registering
[SPEAKER_01]: their product, be it the flower,
because they have licenses under a Section
[SPEAKER_01]: 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can also have access with the South
African based medicine, but that's with
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the oils, we're still working on how
are we going to get those dossiers
[SPEAKER_01]: submitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why the clinical trials are key,
because what SAPRA requires is you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: prove data on the medicines that you want
to actually register.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're submitting a dossier for
registration, you have to actually show
[SPEAKER_01]: that this is the clinical data that's safe
for the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we have treated the patients
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of trying to get our
medical cannabis access program in Ireland
[SPEAKER_00]: here expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very limited at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one thing that you think is the
biggest failing for most medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: access programs worldwide?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the biggest hurdle that everybody
needs to get over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, the biggest hurdle is the stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stigma attached is still very huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are indoctrinated by the
old school pharmaceutical type practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what people don't understand,
you can actually use both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have this one or that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually use cannabis and
eventually wean patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stigma attached for me is really
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lack of knowledge by medical
professionals, especially Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: is really huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resistance to actually change,
to have patients use medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: that for me is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it here in oncology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We deal with a lot of cancer patients,
normally palliative care, and the doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the doctors, oncologists are dead
against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't understand why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I realize is it's the lack of
knowledge by medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lack of knowledge or education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel once we can educate the medical
professionals and say this is the benefit,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the endocannabinoid system,
this is how the cannabinoids work,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is all science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just snake oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I think they will be more receptive
to actually having their patients on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think biosynthesis is the future of
cannabinoid medicines or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll always be a place for extracted
cannabinoids from flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that biosynthesis is going to be
much more regulated, much more pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more superior price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there seems to be a lot of positives
that move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that you might get
clinical boards and let's say old school
[SPEAKER_00]: indoctrinated doctors, as you said,
they'll be more palatable to prescribe
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's already capsule and in
pill form, as opposed to trying to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about blends and formulations of
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why that medicine, I think there's
a place for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our context, in our country,
I feel with the doctors, what will make it
[SPEAKER_01]: easier for them if you have a set of
formula, that is why the dossiers that I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought in as a two to one ratio,
for example, with the CBD 20 milligram or
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC 10 milligram, the others are one
to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's already in that format where we
just then teach the doctors how to dose
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's already in a bio available format.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also sprays now with the tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel definitely there is a place for
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the doctors, you also want to make
their lives easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to say, here's a product similar
to how you have your opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we would recommend you
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other problem that we have,
Owen, that I've actually noticed with
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and other doctors I'm working
with, is cannabis is different because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an individualized treatment plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have the same disease as
somebody else, but your dose may be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit different from the other dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why we always say with dosing,
we always start low, go slow until we
[SPEAKER_01]: build up those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we teach the medical professionals,
I've trained over 100 medical
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals at one of the events,
but it was very short training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just open up their minds to so
much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree with you that you need to give
them something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't expect them to mix and formulate and
teach them about the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say, here's the formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we suggest you dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will definitely work,
be it in capsules or oils or sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the last topic
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the first medical
cannabis study that's happening in South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're one of the lead investigators
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us basically how far you are
along in this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the main objective that you're
looking to get out of the study and the
[SPEAKER_00]: duration that you hope it will take?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very interesting study.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're actually looking at is how we
can actually replace opioids using a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This for chronic pain management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to renew the study for another
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, we had a few issues with
regards to recruitment of patients and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of teething issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, it was the first study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've learned from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we renewed the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking to recruit patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 1,000 samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking to see how many we
actually do get and what type of evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: that we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're looking to see how do the
patients actually respond to these various
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations that the doctors will
prescribe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we actually get them off the opioids?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with cannabinoids, the mechanism
of analgesia is opioid sparing effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do know that cannabinoids work
synergistically with opioids and pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at more association with
the opiate sparing effect, looking at how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can actually help prevent
tolerance to and withdrawal from the
[SPEAKER_01]: opiates, and also looking at how we can
rekindle the opiate analgesia after prior
[SPEAKER_01]: dosage has worn off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to then document all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides just looking at that, we're also
going to be looking at the quality of life
[SPEAKER_01]: of those patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means, has the quality of life
improved?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, upset changing from the
cannabinoids to the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pain management, we're going to use
the brief pain inventory, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the World Health Organization to
look at the pain before and after,
[SPEAKER_01]: while they were on the opioids and while
we're weaning them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pilot study results really looked
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had about 98% of the patients
that had pain relief from the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, we were able to wean all of
those patients off the opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some patients, it took much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some patients, it was much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the cancer patients, it also took
much longer as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will also depend on the specific
diagnosis on that patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although we're working with chronic
pain, we're going to have patients with
[SPEAKER_01]: various ailments, various diagnosis from,
be it cancer, oncology patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: or be it patients with migraines,
or patients with autoimmune disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: like emulsified sclerosis, fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still also learning a lot,
but the pilot study showed great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited to see what will
be the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we actually get the patients weaned
off the opioids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can cannabinoids actually be a replacement
for opioids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too mild?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too strong?
[SPEAKER_01]: What will be the exact dosages that we
will need for patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because patients will differ, as I
mentioned earlier, individualized
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, does cannabis actually help to
improve the quality of life of those
[SPEAKER_01]: patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know with opioids, the quality
of life of the patients is not really
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect it has on the organs,
the liver, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides the toxicity, the overdose is also
a great concern, and also the opioid
[SPEAKER_01]: deaths or mortality rates that we've been
having.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get a lot of data out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited to see where we're
going to head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to run it for a year,
so we're expecting to publish and finish
[SPEAKER_01]: everything within a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing the results of
that, because I don't think there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: country in the world that somebody doesn't
know somebody who's been addicted to
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids at some stage, whether it started
off as back pain or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you can turn those into blends
with cannabinoids and blend the both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them together so it's not as addictive,
would be the primary objective for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all the places around the world,
what country or what state or what city
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented the best medical cannabis
access program that you know of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm working very closely with
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada has been many years ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have partners there as well who have
helped us as well here in South Africa
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with a lot of clinics in
Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really see Canada with the way that
they're going with the medical way
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it allows access to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still managed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is still controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to your standards, I think they
actually did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also part of the Society of Cannabis
Clinicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the board of directors in the
US and the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the United States, also with the
clinicians I'm working with, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really, really forward thinking,
understand it really good with the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients they access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it depends on the different
states and the legislation across states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the one issue with the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I think Canada is still really
maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm working
[SPEAKER_01]: very closely with the Canadians.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been to Germany now recently for
ICBC, the International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was also awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met a lot of interesting people as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see Germany is trying to get the
medical moving forward and also trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how they're going to work with the
recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still a lot of stumbling
blocks and things they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just want to mention one more
country I'm working with as well is
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Thailand just opened up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're obviously trying to find their
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they're allowing a lot more
access with regards to patients and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting to watch and see,
you know, Netherlands, Switzerland also
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into play to see what the medical
side as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think Canada, for me, because I've
been working closely with the doctors and
[SPEAKER_01]: the clinics seem to be you don't have a
lot of patients have access.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not too many restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have for a lot of a lot of stick that
the Canadian industry takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've gotten a lot of things
better than most other territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're at our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can touch base when you come
towards the end of your study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd be happy to publish it up here in
Europe for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's been absolutely great
chatting to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much and all the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
