[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined by Anna
Simmons, Chief Communications Officer for
[SPEAKER_01]: E4 Cultivirus.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Anna?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, Anna is joining me at seven o
'clock in the morning, Hawaii time,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we've got to give her very big props
for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for taking the time out for talk
to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to basically give everybody a
little overview of how you got into the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and where you're at now with
these four cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got into cannabis by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had enjoyed it for years, but working in
the industry is new to most of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, just a few years old in the legal
states in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and for Canadians, their whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just chanced into helping out some
growers locally who needed licensing when
[SPEAKER_00]: we got our laws passed and they changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a medical cannabis system and then
they were moving everyone into the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just kind of got in by accident
and then I found that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is something I believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really meaningful work and just kind
of went from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, you know, sped up and got more
involved and became more public with my
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll kick things off with the first
topic, which is we both know that
[SPEAKER_01]: education is the tip of the spear in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people who are working in the
education sphere, these are the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: actually moving the industry forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you give everybody a little bit of
background for you and your CBD certified,
[SPEAKER_01]: the free educational CBD program for the
sensory stuff that you guys do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with with cannabis, there's a lot of
myths that are passed around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether on the Internet or word of mouth
and a lot of personal opinions that get
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really wanted to offer as part
of our mission, a science based education
[SPEAKER_00]: program that would give people a little
bit firmer footing to kind of base their
[SPEAKER_00]: their decisions about their health
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we focused on CBD specifically
because that is what East Fork is known
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've always bred for CBD rich
varieties, whether that was in our adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis side or, you know,
then later we have a craft hemp side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's it's no good to have
access to all these products if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to use them properly and you
don't understand why they work,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they work, you know, to the best
extent that we do understand those things
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot still to be learned
in cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, basically, we really just
wanted to create this resource and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: free so that people can understand what
CBD is, how it works with the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant and how those things are
interacting with our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think you'd agree there seemed
to be the first wave of cannabis was all
[SPEAKER_01]: the people with loads of cash who were
invested in things who didn't really care
[SPEAKER_01]: about learning too much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were kind of getting told four
stories of one actual product from four
[SPEAKER_01]: different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons I started this
is so I could get the answers myself from
[SPEAKER_01]: the leading experts around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually been highly informative
and been able to cut through the bullshit
[SPEAKER_01]: and get straight to the actual real honest
answers to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important because these are,
you know, people are using this plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and whether that's for more
serious conditions like epilepsy or things
[SPEAKER_00]: like MS and cancer or even just the more
common everyday ailments that everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: deals with, you know, anxiety,
inflammation, pain, insomnia, those kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think there's a lot more
research coming out on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: What seemed to be small little ailments,
but that are affecting such a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: population that we don't need to be
thinking along the lines of the miracle
[SPEAKER_01]: drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does enough good things for a small
couple of causes and maybe focus on that
[SPEAKER_01]: and get more R&D done in those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on to the second topic,
which is I couldn't help notice it when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was looking through these four cultivars
that every single person there seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a very happy individual and enjoy their
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us little people a bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of background that would you
agree that happy people grow happy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there is there something to my
madness there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a lot of energy that
passes between people and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anyone who's ever had
houseplants and cared for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that, you know, they respond to
their environments and that's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight and water or fertilizer,
but it's also music or some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the things that
we as humans have maybe lost some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge we used to have about
communicating with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can say it that way, you know,
there's definitely living things we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have energy in us that passes between
us in all these different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that, you know,
emotions can definitely be part of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeding and nourishing the plants
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and on our farm, we do a lot of
the really regenerative methods for caring
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we make compost teas on site that we
use and we do Korean natural farming where
[SPEAKER_00]: we ferment the positive, you know,
beneficial bacteria and have those in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil helping to keep the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think that caring for the
plants and appreciating them and loving
[SPEAKER_00]: them does make a difference too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I originally have a career in music
as an arranger for orchestras decades ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand the vibrations of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the things that I think
you could actually do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: research and play a different couple of
styles of music and maybe sell a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: playlists to the cultivars around the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they're all vibrations and
you can already do with a baby being born
[SPEAKER_01]: in the womb that they listen to a song
when they're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they listen to it when they're
born, they stop crying because the
[SPEAKER_01]: vibrations put them back in the womb
mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should create that playlist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would listen to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might just have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me move on to the next topic,
which is, I'm sure, a big one for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody kind of understands the stigma
behind THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this date back to Harry J Ainslinger
back in the 30s with his campaign?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the 60s campaign or is it Reagan in
the 80s?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the where's the big smoke and
hullabaloo behind this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but really, yeah, Ainslinger
back in the 30s was the big that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: big push, you know, to really demonize,
criminalize and and then create propaganda
[SPEAKER_00]: against the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, you could buy it tinctures in
pharmacies in the US, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when, of course, they created
or publicized using the word marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to link, you know,
the plant to Mexican people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: southwest of the US, who, of course,
they were painting as unsavory characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And black people, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, even more than that,
the US is responsible for pushing that
[SPEAKER_00]: that stigma and propaganda on the rest of
the world through our drug treaties,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that's the kind of thing
that we're starting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're slowly getting undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to see Canada and Uruguay,
you know, legally federally legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, we're going to see more and
more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just such a shame that the US has
pushed that because it's unscientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC is medically beneficial for
numerous different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to only be discovering
more of them as we are able to do more
[SPEAKER_00]: research as these legal barriers start to
fall away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually, as an education expert,
might be able to help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ainslinger, was he pushing the marijuana
thing because they owned cotton farms and
[SPEAKER_01]: that hemp was going to be replacing one of
the fibers that they were using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that, again, that just another
addition to an article that's Chinese
[SPEAKER_01]: whispers over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there are a lot of those
different factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have particular knowledge about
the fiber side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although people do like to talk about
those industrial motivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know with Ainslinger there were,
he had, you know, he saw it was
[SPEAKER_00]: politically useful to demonize certain
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also he had personal animosity
towards, you know, racial animosity
[SPEAKER_00]: towards other groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some of the quotes that are set
down historically make that really clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, you know, a really,
a confluence of really sad factors
[SPEAKER_00]: between, you know, personal racism and
then political influence and potentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, industrial gains or benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all around us, I think we could just
tag them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me this, let's get out to something
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some of the brands that you're
noticing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand that it's still state by state
over there and you haven't had the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cross competition and the mergers and
acquisitions that will happen over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there any cookies we've heard about
over here in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any big brands that you can see
that are making good gains in any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: infused beverages, edibles or the
homegrown flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the homegrown flour, the cultivator
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, as you pointed out,
our markets are all segregated state by
[SPEAKER_00]: state and it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if two states are legal and they
border each other, you still can't import
[SPEAKER_00]: export from one to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that creates a situation where brands
are either landlocked with their own state
[SPEAKER_00]: or they have to set up identical separate
companies to keep the same brand in
[SPEAKER_00]: different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see some, they call them MSOs,
multi-state operators and bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations that are building their
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I've been more impressed by
some of the smaller craft companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: have grown and built themselves into
having a national audience or recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see some like Kana Craft in
California and I guess there's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: many I really want to shout out because
honestly, I'm not that impressed with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think the smaller companies where
they are people who've been doing this for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time before it was legal and they
have the deep knowledge of the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Aunt Zelda's is a good one in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen, you know, in Oregon,
we've seen some some brands like Grun,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, you know, has become national on
the CBD side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's going to be a lot of
shakeups as our laws continue changing and
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's an ever evolving landscape at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's trying to keep your finger on the
pulse is like trying to hold a hot egg at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your hopes and dreams raise
cultivar for the next 12 months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you guys going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we're doing a lot of fun
things right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is always, you know,
inherently risky because you never know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's coming around the corner for the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are, in addition to being a
production farm, we're a goods maker and
[SPEAKER_00]: we we make our own tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a genetics house and we're
producing feminized seed as well as tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture clones on the hemp side for
growers to grow at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are our own original lines of
genetics that we've bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are opening a retail store,
which is a little crazy during covid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's and it's called Hemp
Bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty cool, you know,
retail place where you can call them,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about, of course, our hemp based CBD
products and have CBD mocktails and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, try things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really lovely community space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of want to see all of those
pieces continue to grow and thrive and
[SPEAKER_00]: reach as many people as we can with
quality plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't thank you enough for coming
on the show and help and educate the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience on the topics that we talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I presume Anna Simmons is your handle
across social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody wants to get in touch with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually exit drug on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to, you know,
the exit from from the bad drugs is
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, thank you very much for
coming on the show and I hope we will
[SPEAKER_01]: catch up again towards the end of the year
and see how things have all progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You.
You.
