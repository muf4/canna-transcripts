.
[SPEAKER_01]: another episode of the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined by Anuj Desai,
who is a lawyer, commercial lawyer on top
[SPEAKER_01]: leading cannabis and is consulted over in
London and the host of one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts in the world, The Cannabis
Conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had some of the biggest guests on
that you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm delighted to talk to Anuj.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to talking to you for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a lot of insights I'm sure the
audience are going to love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to get everybody just a
little overview of how you got to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial lawyer and got into the
cannabis industry quickly just so
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's up to speed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background is as a commercial
lawyer, mainly working in the media space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked for a variety of big media
companies in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of got a bit restless a few
years ago, wanted to do something more
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quit my job, kissed a few frogs,
started my own business with a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of stumbled on medical
cannabis at the end of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd only known about it recreationally
before then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And went to a few conferences and I was
sort of like, wow, there's there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a real chance to be a very
positive impact on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started to kind of read more and meet
more people, but I couldn't really figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started a podcast because no one was
really doing it in Europe at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few American ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, 110 episodes now in interviewed
some great people across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of ever expanding,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more and more topics to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, that's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off the back of that, I started a
commercial consultancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still do a bit of lawyering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But alongside that, I'm kind of helping
early stage businesses with anything from
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of board advisor type stuff to
helping them with their fundraising to
[SPEAKER_00]: advising on strategic acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're one of the inspirations for
this show to start up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kick things off, get
everybody up to speed when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations that's been passed so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we looking at UK 1 EU 0?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a positive move that we
legalized medical a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that it hasn't really
changed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very many people have managed to get
prescriptions on the NHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a real boner contention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The framework and the education within the
medical fraternity is not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's a crucial step as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your GP, so your frontline access to
medical help, is not able to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another step that needs to go
to a consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those GPs don't know when to refer or
who to refer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge amount of people within the
NHS that just didn't even know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis had been legalized medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the knowledge just isn't there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's huge amounts of work that needs
to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the wider reform,
we're very far behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sadiq Khan, actually the London mayor,
last week announced that he would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up the discussion around
decriminalization, which is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: positive move.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Boris Johnson the next day squashed it
very quickly, saying that cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the level of ignorance that
you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows how far we have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Tory government have never been
evidence driven when it comes to drug
[SPEAKER_00]: reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not hopeful personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the flip side, Boris is not averse
to you turning at any moment if it suits
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone waves a bit of cash at him,
who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: He might just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would say on the EU side is I think
there's a lot of positive moves on the EU
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowing hemp varieties up to 0.3%
THC, which is bringing it in line with the
[SPEAKER_00]: states, which I think is very positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the individual countries are
doing lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So France's new medical pilot program got
lots of stuff going on in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: German domestic production, Switzerland
raising its limit on THC to 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would argue that the EU is probably
being a bit more progressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the things you see a lot of
financial information coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: London.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know whether that's smoke and
mirrors and maybe convincing me that it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like it's moving quickly in the UK
compared to the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because over in Ireland here, we've still
got the police force not enacting the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Council law that was brought in
December.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lady called Vera Toomey has to
pay 10,000 euros every two, three months
[SPEAKER_01]: for a bedrock and for her child,
which is pretty much CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as if it's some magic formula
they're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to hear that you think that
the EU are moving forward quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should just say that I don't think
anyone's moving quick enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reality, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking to Petri last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's up in Helsinki.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD is a pharmaceutical drug in
Finland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think there needs to be a lot
of consolidation in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully this is one of the things
we're going to try and do with the show to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to as many different countries
and many different CEOs and businesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: try and get everybody on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's be realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The North American companies want a piece
of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Europe creating the kind of high end
products like the brandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The champagne, the Guinness, I think
within time will come from European
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's hope that's the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking about European manufacturers,
I'm very positive in terms of as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a terrible government over here
at the moment, excuse me for this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that Ireland is going to be the base for
European cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The North American companies are already
positioned here with the low tax rate that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got an English speaking workforce,
highly skilled, young workforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that statement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you see somewhere else in Europe
like Malta maybe pipping us to the number
[SPEAKER_01]: one spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, look, it's difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly think Brexit has been a boost
for Ireland for some of the reasons you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being English speaking does make it very
attractive for North Americans to base
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, you know, the tax incentives that
you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe, you know, Ireland is very
strong in pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was surprised to learn that over a
third of EU net exports come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think all of the major pharma
companies have a base in Ireland as a
[SPEAKER_00]: consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, obviously highlighted by
the fact that Jazz Pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: recently bought GW Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think on the medical side of things,
it will certainly be an important hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it would be the main HQ for
European cannabis, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because of the size of Ireland,
maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it could be a very important
player.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that you mentioned,
we've had Vera on the show as well to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of tell us about what's happening in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had Leah Fletcher as well on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Ireland, similarly to the
UK, has quite a conservative core,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at its heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's quite hard to change and modify,
particularly with such a thorny issue as
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think there's a lot of
challenges for Ireland, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly well placed, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll benefit from Brexit,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the one thing that's kind of
leading Ireland's way as much as there is
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians in power at the moment that
might not see it from what we've been told
[SPEAKER_01]: by inside the government is that the
politicians have no problem legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's senior civil servants that are
holding the whole thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's we've also got a history of a
country of having a loud voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel sorry for the politicians at
the moment, because if you go on to
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter, they're getting hounded on the
thousands of tweets every day from all the
[SPEAKER_01]: activists, which is exactly what needs to
be done to help educate and inform the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys to bring this industry to the
standard that it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason why the European country
shouldn't be creating our own brands and
[SPEAKER_01]: creating our own versions as opposed to
just importing North American products
[SPEAKER_01]: that, let's face it, are not as good a
quality when it comes to the European
[SPEAKER_01]: products on a scale when you're
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing I want to talk to you
about was lots of things going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: UK at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the novel food and the LSE
listings that are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think UK are going to be the
financial hub for the European cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry just because the framework is
already there for the investment?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen a lot of the big
investments in the LSE listing so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to be a positive move for
London.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, I think Brexit is an issue
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, already we're seeing on a general
level non-cannabis that London is no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer the kind of financial hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of stuff is moving over to
Amsterdam and Frankfurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're obviously being a bit more
progressive by opening up to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my concern would be around a
repetition of what happened in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these companies who floated
in London, they've got very little
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful revenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the market caps are quite big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've ridden this hype wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe this is kind of public markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're seeing it with crypto and
you're seeing it with the kind of Reddit
[SPEAKER_00]: type investors who are driving prices up
because of kind of putting together a
[SPEAKER_00]: groundswell of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessarily a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the retail investor often is the one
that kind of loses out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, when you've got vast valuations
based on very little revenues,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's kind of real detachment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should really be about building a
business through your own, generating your
[SPEAKER_00]: own revenues and a bit of private
investment to kind of get you a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you're established,
then you list.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got companies that are listing
before they're even doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very much what happened in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2019, there was obviously a
bit of a crash there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my worry would be that some of things
happen in London.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens is the regulators
and the exchanges then sort of clamp down
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't allow cannabis companies to
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a risk there if it's
not handled well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see genuine companies that
are listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side of that, I think it does
get quite a lot of headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that a lot of
people, it gets a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people start to see it as a more grown
up industry that draws in more talent and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully some more institutional money,
which brings a bit of stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from that perspective, I think it
could be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got other things going on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some M&A action as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AMAC being bought by Curaleaf,
which is a very big deal in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's much more of a signal to the
market than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, we'll create a bit of a
buzz around about the industry in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people will be like,
oh, wow, this is actually something real
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's good from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big numbers, as much as some of them
are inflated and not driven by real core
[SPEAKER_01]: value or turnover, anything like that,
is the thing that a lot of the politicians
[SPEAKER_01]: and people who have no clue are looking
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just seeing how many jobs can
we make?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money are we going to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be the deciding factor
for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me this, your opinion on the next two
to three years, Europe versus the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: who do you think comes out on top?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's too difficult to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about cannabis,
wider cannabis, medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think UK is a bit behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got Germany's 50,000
prescriptions, maybe 50,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got certain other European
countries that are being more progressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got something here,
but it's quite hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need some proper reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't think the government at
the moment is minded to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for good reason, I think COVID is
obviously the massive priority for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone and then getting the economy back
on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the latter part of that, cannabis
could feature as a way to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's by no means certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen very successfully some
lobbying from the people in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: the European Super League and football
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that, unfortunately,
cannabis has the same kind of galvanizing
[SPEAKER_00]: across the spectrum but you could see
quite concerted efforts to push that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, and we haven't talked about
novel foods, but how that kind of pans out
[SPEAKER_00]: will be quite interesting too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the novel food in the UK applicable to
Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting me on the spot here.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've been told, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to have a second license,
an EU license now that Brexit's gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told that too, but it's unclear
because I've heard conflicting statements
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an area I specialize in
around licensing and regulatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that spend a lot
of money on getting that clearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the regulators just don't have the
resources to police it or enforce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what will happen is it will be
self-enforcing because if you spent a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred grand on all the testing,
you're not gonna want to see someone down
[SPEAKER_00]: the road who hasn't done any of that
continue to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be dubbing each other in,
I think, a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think one of the positive things
for Europe that we can look forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a multi-state that we're
operating under, Germany is kind of our
[SPEAKER_01]: test model at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Germany have made massive,
the Green Party have made massive gains
[SPEAKER_01]: over in Germany recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could end up seeing Germany with a
recreational market before a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, if that's the case,
then the EU countries will just replicate
[SPEAKER_01]: the model that Germany has integrated in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And twinned with what's going on in the
States, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exciting time for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, we try and keep it to a short
enough time for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you very much for coming
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very much appreciated,
very informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope we can talk again towards the
end of the year with some more updates for
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep up the great podcast,
mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very informative and very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
