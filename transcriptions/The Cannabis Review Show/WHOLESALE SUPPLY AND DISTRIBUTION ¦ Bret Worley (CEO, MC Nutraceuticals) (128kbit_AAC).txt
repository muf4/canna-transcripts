[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Brett Wardy, who's the CEO of MC
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Brett?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you too, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are one of the largest global
suppliers of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to talk to you about
distribution and wholesale supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little 30-second, 60-second overview
[SPEAKER_00]: of how you came about being a part of MC
Nutraceuticals and what you guys do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the hemp industry since May
of 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first started with a chromatography
remediation company where we just removed
[SPEAKER_01]: THC from CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That business model wasn't all that
feasible during the crash of CBD pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: crashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually I pivoted into my own whole
identity called MC Nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we now distribute and manufacture the
39 cannabinoids that are derived from hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: that are currently available on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are one of the only companies that
offers every cannabinoid that is offered
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last two and a half years,
we've gained quite the market share in the
[SPEAKER_01]: US and also abroad, where we ship to 19
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to, I was looking at the
list, you guys have 42 types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids available on your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to selecting these
cannabinoids, is it outside suppliers that
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up going to do partnerships for
and you're kind of the center point in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry, or are you cultivating or
biosynthesizing your own molecules?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are more of a distribution,
so we'll contract manufacturer out with
[SPEAKER_01]: other labs that are in local to Denver,
Colorado, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do our own R&D, our own
analytics in-house, and we also do some
[SPEAKER_01]: small scale manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times we'll build it and then
have someone else go scale it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the R&D process,
can you speak to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take for you guys to
figure out, OK, this cannabinoid we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bring to market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, is it one of these,
how long is a piece of string?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, there's the chicken and
the egg scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, you know, what does the market
need versus how long the R&D process is?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes things just kind of
fall on your lap where a chemist makes
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's needed in the market,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So R&D processes can happen, take up to a
year and sometimes they're as short as
[SPEAKER_01]: three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big hurdles is standard
creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to actually contract that out,
you know, 99.99% reference standard with
[SPEAKER_01]: an outside company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take that to a third party who
does a third party review on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure it is what it is, run an NMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll essentially start using
that for testing in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So testing is one of the hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, just the basic R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our products are essentially 95%
pure, if not 99%.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they are 99% pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also just getting to that point where
everything is pure, free of toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run everything through a toxicology lab
that's local to us to make sure that there
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't any other byproducts essentially
made in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that process, we're able to
fully distribute it once it's third party
[SPEAKER_01]: tested, ran through toxicology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a need in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you make something and it's not
necessarily needed in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the need in the
market, are you highlighting opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing, let's say, CBGA for cosmetics
or whatever it may be, and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pivot to these clients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there smaller, let's say,
distributors and wholesalers below you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that are dealing directly with
formulation companies or with brands who
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking to create a new product range?
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of my company is the ability to do
business development for our clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our clients are always looking for the
newest best thing that does X.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, way back in the day,
CBN helps with sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens when you mirror CBN and
put THC with it, you have a hell of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think part of it's us doing the own
formulations for other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We test it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We send it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the business development
product development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do a lot of that in-house for our
clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see ourselves as you buy from us,
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we just want to keep it
transactional, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to have a deeper
relationship with us, we'll tell you what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do or what we think is working in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over 300 clients internally,
and then we probably distribute to another
[SPEAKER_01]: 400, 500 indirectly through brokers or
clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or contract manufacturers or people like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we probably have one of the best
understandings of what sells and what
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't from the top down view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also take feedback down from
the people that are actually distributing
[SPEAKER_01]: straight to stores, smoke shops,
gas stations, grocery stores, wherever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to you guys have a
global presence now in 17, 18 countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you mentioned before we came on
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the logistics and the
distribution of these cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you sourcing more at a local area or
is the ability to take these across the
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlantic, across the Pacific, pretty easy
for a company of your size?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a distribution or fulfillment
center in Pilsen, Prague.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Pilsen, Czech Republic is about an
hour outside of Prague.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we send most of our product there for
inventory for what's needed in the EU
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EU market's a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's only five or six cannabinoids
that really do sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a big ask for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the inventory all 42.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we send that over to there and then
then we can distribute it easy through the
[SPEAKER_01]: EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to sustainability for
the industry moving forward, as these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules are going to become more sought
after and more looked after, do you see
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnology companies filling a space,
especially in the European Union,
[SPEAKER_00]: where regulations might be a little bit
stricter and they want a replicable
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule over and over again?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the biotechnology
companies are going to play in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient side of things for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they probably would call them
biotechnology companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a few already in Europe,
but the US, and I'll just say this because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the US, but the US is years ahead
of where Europe is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that on an economic
level, on a sophistication level,
[SPEAKER_01]: a regulation level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of seeing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of seeing, I would say,
once Delta 8 was introduced to the market
[SPEAKER_01]: in the US, I would say Europe's about a
year after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still in its infancy to a certain
degree, where people are still kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering what it is in Europe that's
mainly hexahydrocannabinol, which is HHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big product that we see over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's still a lot of growing
and evolution done over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend my time going to Europe and
educating regulators and politicians about
[SPEAKER_01]: similar stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they're still fairly early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if someone would enter the
market, because we haven't seen any
[SPEAKER_01]: biotech companies, for the most part,
enter the US hemp-derived cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I think there is some,
which you would consider biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, maybe in the water-soluble
space specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do see people claiming they're a
biotech company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we haven't seen anyone biotech
large-scale manufacturing in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people that are manufacturing on
large scale were already in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they were CBD manufacturers,
typically, because they already had most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the equipment and the infrastructure to
build out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the companies, let's say, that
biosynthesize their own cell line and are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to use advanced fermentation
techniques, they're not so much supplying
[SPEAKER_00]: the recreational industry in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that more pharmaceutical side of
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly how I'd put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's some R&D companies out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There always is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the commercial availability
on a scale, we're seeing most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: products still being made from,
you know, original 2018 hemp farm
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typical extraction all the way to
isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then isolates then used to be
converted to Delta-8, Delta-10,
[SPEAKER_01]: HHC, CBN, THCV, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moving on to the intoxicating hemp
derivatives seems to be the new buzzword
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm reading from America that seems
to encompass all of the HHC and Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've been already speaking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see HHC all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy jellies in the regular kind of
old head store now in Dublin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten so far over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they're here to stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at some of the figures from
Bob Holman's article on Forbes that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically gave some of the size of the
numbers that these products and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they here to stay?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I have my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm already spending time over in
Europe, as I mentioned, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: educating people on what these products
are, why they're safe, why you should
[SPEAKER_01]: allow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the best way to describe it is,
you know, obviously Bob Holman's article
[SPEAKER_01]: is a good one to reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beau Whitney is the economist that's doing
a lot of work on the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp industry, who's probably going to
start working on some of the European hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing, you know, Florida has now
become the largest cannabis market in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a six point nine billion dollar
retail market, which passes California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was done in three years,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think it would be wise to
at least slow down on any types of bans
[SPEAKER_01]: such as Austria or Switzerland or I think
Finland now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be wise for an economic
level to slow down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety means regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to propose tomorrow
actually in our press conference in
[SPEAKER_01]: Czechia, regulations that we would suggest
would be deemed appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also done the same thing in Alabama,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and now Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the main one's 21 plus behind
the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an adult and you want to consume
cannabis, I think you should be allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use cannabis as the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any cannabinoid in the plant,
whether it's HHC or CBN or THCB,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter to me if it's
psychoactive or not, it all comes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am recommending regulation in all
these countries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe it to be a huge economic
driver whilst we wait for regulation and
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization of marijuana, which is still
probably years out, maybe for Germany for
[SPEAKER_01]: full blown legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then who knows for the rest of the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also seen in the hemp industry that
moderate regulation is significantly more
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful for medical patients,
recreational patients, any type of patient
[SPEAKER_01]: or consumer than medical or recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recreation of medical cannabis did
about 33 billion last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think the number, which we'll have in
the next three to four months of Beau
[SPEAKER_01]: Whitney is over 40 billion for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind the hemp industry has been
around since 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis market has been around since
2012, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the cannabis industry did in 12
years, we were able to do in four or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're about twice as fast as they are
from a distribution economics perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, we've expanded
the cannabis science to include 42
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, where the marijuana industry
only does four or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not because the marijuana
industry doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because they're overregulated to
the point where they can't adopt and
[SPEAKER_01]: innovate fast, whether it's capital,
whether it's just regulation in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp industry is moving at a pace that
you just can't keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here to stay, especially in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: The European Union will see how fast I can
get out there and educate everybody on the
[SPEAKER_01]: topic is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's going to be one of
these sectors where different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world are just going to be completely
differently legislated and different range
[SPEAKER_00]: of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's going to be a
translate from North America over into
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think between the 27 countries in the
European Union, they're all completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different and have completely different
needs at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the advancements that are
happening in Germany and Prague and
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland are a sign of things to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that the Czech Republic roll
back the laws that they changed just
[SPEAKER_00]: recently regarding CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I don't understand the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's actually a law put
in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be misunderstanding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Prague, you can't earn the Czech
Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is European Union,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't advertise CBD at all,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's more of what the
Department of Agriculture was saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of more of the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I understand CBD is it's a novelty
item.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want it, you buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no information about it
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, it's like a knickknack
essentially that you can eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's one of the part of the
proposed changes to the regulation is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, listen, you want the people at the
store educating people on CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN, HHG, whatever it is, so they can
responsibly consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think that obviously I
truly believe that was a misstep by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture there or the
Ministry of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I'm here to try to educate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, before before I started talking
to some of the advisors, the prime
[SPEAKER_01]: minister and the health ministry,
there's there's just no one to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you start educating people,
I think people start to understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: economics, the safety, understand the
product and why it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the 44 cannabinoids that you guys
work with, what are the top three in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think those top three are going
to change over the next five to 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll preface, but probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the top one in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we sell about a thousand
kilos a week at Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about a billion doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the scale is quite pretty unfathomable
about how much just our company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's 15, 20,
30 alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is consuming billions and billions and
billions of doses a month, which is just
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's great, honestly, to see that
people actually want this product,
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to consume this product and it
helps them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest one's Delta 8 in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second biggest or the first biggest in
Europe is HHC, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we send about 500, 800 kilos a
month, sometimes a thousand on a good
[SPEAKER_01]: month to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing a similar demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously less competition as
importing HHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also less people that make HHC in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the demand is still not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Delta 8 is the king here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: HHC is the king in the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm trying to think of the second
biggest one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll tell you my favorite,
just because at the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there is there is a huge gap in
between Delta 8 and the next one
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially on a volume basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite cannabinoids are CVN and THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have the best known
therapeutical benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV is now coming down to a price where I
think people are going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: formulating in with their Delta 8 or
whatever product it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't make claims,
but CVN, let's just say it's good at night
[SPEAKER_01]: time and THCV is good in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, those products are to have
serious promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that the hemp industry was
able to make those at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I foresee that those are going to be
huge products on the medicinal side in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next, let's call it 12 months from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just reached our 15 minute spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an amazing conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to talk to you again towards
the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the European Union is steamed along
and we've got all these new countries
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for chatting with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who want to know more,
MC Nutraceuticals website is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend checking them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the top dogs in America when it
comes to wholesale supply of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Brett, thank you very much for your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, chat soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
