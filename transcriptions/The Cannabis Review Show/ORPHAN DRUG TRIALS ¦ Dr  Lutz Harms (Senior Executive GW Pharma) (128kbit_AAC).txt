[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Dr. Lutz Harms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the Senior Director at GW Pharma in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping this morning,
Lutz?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Ian.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a bit of snow here in Dublin,
so all is good in my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter has started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter has started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It surely has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the Christmas feeling is
starting to come around now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much for taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy man and
hopefully we get to know some information
[SPEAKER_01]: on the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little brief overview of how you ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: at GW Pharma as their first employee and
your position in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a pharmacist and pharmacologist
by education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after my PhD, I started my business
life in Big Pharma for more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2017, I joined GW to launch
the first cannabis-derived anti-epileptic
[SPEAKER_00]: drug in rare childhood epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I joined GW then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the topic of this episode is what are
orphan drug trials?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of what is an orphan drug trial and why
[SPEAKER_01]: are they important in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, orphan drug trials, that's a
clinical study in a rare disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rare disease is defined less than five
people affected out of 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking really few patients here
that are suffering from really sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: very serious diseases with no effective
treatment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you start the clinical
study to prove the safety and efficacy in
[SPEAKER_00]: this rare disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, these are a few weeks only
for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes in some cases, it's taking
you even a couple of months in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: start and then finish the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of this trial, then usually you
publish the results of the study in a
[SPEAKER_00]: peer-reviewed journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all about an orphan drug trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this seems to be one of the avenues
that for cannabinoid-derived
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical products that orphan drug
trials are maybe one of the best avenues
[SPEAKER_01]: for biotechnology and technology companies
to be taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm convinced that that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to prove, again, safety and
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important for patients and their
families of anything that becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursed drug in the end for the sake of
these patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose the objective is to make
evidence-based medicines and the evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to come from trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can echo what you just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the evidence-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, you need the data in proven
statistically proven published
[SPEAKER_00]: peer-reviewed randomized trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing else than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, next topic I wanted to jump onto was
launching Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of patients and a lot of consumers
out there, I don't think, would have a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete understanding or nuanced overview
of how a product like Epidiolex is
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the launch of Epidiolex,
what was the exact process?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the kind of time frame that you
guys would have been working under?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically once you have started
an orphan drug trial, it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: successful and published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go into the next phase to launch
a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is then all about you bring these
studies to the regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, it's the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, it's the EMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you compile all your data you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, with Epidiolex, it has been
five successful studies to launch this
[SPEAKER_00]: product in two rare childhood epilepsies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All five were successful and showed
exactly the same safety and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put everything together and brought
it then in Europe to the EMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as I said, in the US,
to the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take from the moment you submit
your data until they give you their
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you one year, roughly,
depending on the outcome and depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the results you can offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that in Europe to say that we
did that in Europe in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one year later, we received the
approval in September to launch this drug
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is really the milestone for any
drug to be available for patients in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be very successful so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody understands or knows about
the Jazz Pharmaceuticals Purchaser GW.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it came to the research and
development of Epidiolex, was that a
[SPEAKER_01]: decade-long R&D process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I'm not mistaken, Epidiolex is
derived from a strain of hemp that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: high potency of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Epidiolex is a purified
cannabidiol drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's THC-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to note because many
people might combine THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, or mix everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really pure cannabidiol grown
in the UK, purified in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: and manufactured in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's true.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second drug out of the GW research,
the first one, has been Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 50-50 mixture of THC and CBD
cannabidiol for the treatment of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms in MS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to the future,
obviously, the blends and formulations of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the rare cannabinoids and terpenes
and having perfect blends and creating
[SPEAKER_01]: products out of that is the objective in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the biosynthetic companies
playing a big part in that role?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously, with plant matter,
you can't isolate a specific amount of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that it's going to have to be
synthesized or fermented in some way in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bioreactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tipping on a critical topic,
maybe, for paving the path in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there is much more to
investigate and research and find into the
[SPEAKER_00]: various kinds of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, the quicker you are to isolate
different molecules, the quicker you can
[SPEAKER_00]: dive a bit deeper into the effect of these
different molecules and for the sake of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients in many other diseases to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last up, I'm going to jump on to before
I let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Market access requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed on my research that you guys in
Germany have a process called AMNOG
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that process and does every
country have their own version of that or
[SPEAKER_01]: is it something unique to Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're closing the journey of a drug
basically in all countries after the
[SPEAKER_00]: studies and after the approval in Europe,
you need obviously a price in your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The processes are looking different
country by country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Germany, we have the so-called
AMNOG process, which takes roughly one
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a two-step process, if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts with a new dossier you have
to prepare based on your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you submit this dossier to the Federal
Joint Committee and they give you an early
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit assessment, a benefit assessment
that brings your drug a little bit into
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison and contacts with existing
drugs on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only in terms of data, but more so
also in terms of price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this assessment, based on the
dossier that you have prepared,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get one of five scale benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this benefit assessment,
you step into the second phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second phase is a discussion and a
negotiation with the sick funds in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the scale you get,
on the rating you get, you have the chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to discuss and negotiate a price that is
finally reimbursed then in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, you have not only an
approved drug, but also a reimbursed price
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the product available in the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to note in Germany that
still an exception in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: the day one after the approval,
you can bring this drug to patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can bring this drug on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the price is negotiated
afterwards and then you've got the full
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the third important step to be
mentioned and to be kept in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your knowledge, does every country
around the world have their own process
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Amnog process that you have in
Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: UK has the famous Amnog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice process.
[SPEAKER_00]: France has a different one and Italy comes
again different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are many different kinds of
setting the reimbursed price depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the German recreational
market, from a scale of one to ten,
[SPEAKER_01]: how confident are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: How confident are you that the government
are going to be able to actually bring a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational market to fruition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on five, giving me a bit space up and
a bit space down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think devil is in the detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The willingness is there to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think here really the question comes
about the source of delivery, the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the end, how strongly they want to
keep an eye on quality, batch to batch
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we discussed it earlier on data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be a lot of hurdles ahead and
for the good of the European industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully Germany can be the leading way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we saw Czech Republic bring out a set
of rules there the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think hopefully we've got an
interesting industry ahead for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: five to ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been amazing talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we get to chat again in the near
future and we can get an update from
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that you're up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, thank you very much,
guys, for watching and we'll see you on
[SPEAKER_01]: the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
