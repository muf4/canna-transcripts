[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Penelope Hamilton from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community over in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping Penelope?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am doing wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland has an affinity with New York so
we have much as an interest that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in New York I think as we do
that's happening in Europe so it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: to have an expert of your caliber on to
give everybody a quick little overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick little brief of what the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community is and the objective and how you
came to be at it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are an online community that was built
onto Facebook and really designed for a
[SPEAKER_01]: safe place for free information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community members can talk with each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is private and we're also advocates and
you know really try to be a voice for them
[SPEAKER_01]: and hear their concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're an online media and news company so
we have directory listings, shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a content creator and you know the
director of community engagement so
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping the people informed is basically
what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay excellent so we have a lady with a
wealth of knowledge now in front of us so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump straight into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First topic I want to talk about was
navigating regulation and policy in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's a huge myriad of different
sectors and different licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give maybe everybody a quick brief
of the mandate for the office of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the licensed applicant receivers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in charge of taxation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the exact job of that board?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our legislation was signed March 31st of
2021 and it took quite a long time for
[SPEAKER_01]: this office of cannabis management to be
formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our legislation, the MRTA, the Marijuana
Regulation and Taxation Act was the
[SPEAKER_01]: building blocks, the foundation of how we
would legalize and what types of licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the office of cannabis management
is written into that to establish the
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and the regulations of how it would
all play out you know in person when we
[SPEAKER_01]: all get to actually apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are developed developing the
regulations, helping with the local laws,
[SPEAKER_01]: building out those license applications,
every little detail of how legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: will work in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay amazing so in terms of the license
applications over here it would be if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a bar or a gambling institution
it looks as if that's kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that people who are applying for
cannabis license would apply under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that similar in New York or is there a
whole separate entity where people apply
[SPEAKER_00]: for every type of cannabis license from
retail to cultivation to purification and
[SPEAKER_00]: lab work?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all separate licenses so there'll
be nine different licenses open for the
[SPEAKER_01]: public and it is sort of being paralleled
you know just like our alcohol and tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: so but it's not the same organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: This office of cannabis management is
brand new so this is something that has to
[SPEAKER_01]: be built out and then there's little you
know groups subgroups under that for
[SPEAKER_01]: advisory and such too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all separate licenses that that
we'll have going out for each and very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific that it will not be vertical
which is you know seed to sale in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State for the large organizations but we
will have seed to sale available for a
[SPEAKER_01]: micro license so that the smaller
individuals can get involved and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: offer a craft product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well I think that having the barriers
to the big MSOs just coming in and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to gobble up the big market it's Canada I
think has proved that that vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated model doesn't succeed when you
have caliber craft growers and a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: highly motivated entrepreneurs can't be
stopped creating new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I wanted to ask you about is
taxation over New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that fall under the IRS purview or
again does the new office of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: management have the power to go and
retrieve taxes that are owed to the state?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean the tax base was written into
the legislation that MRTA and it's being
[SPEAKER_01]: collected at different different areas
some is at different steps you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not all at the at the retail throughout
the process of it being grown processed so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's different taxes that's applied and
then it's collected and sent into the
[SPEAKER_01]: state and then the counties will actually
you know collect and send into their
[SPEAKER_01]: states as well and to be honest that is as
far as my knowledge on the taxation you
[SPEAKER_01]: know piece would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have they released figures of what the
kind of numbers that they're going to tax
[SPEAKER_00]: at or is this still to be determined
before the first retail stores open up in
[SPEAKER_00]: autumn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes we do have it exact you know we do
know we do know what percent will go to
[SPEAKER_01]: counties and any town that opted out of
specific retail or consumption site
[SPEAKER_01]: lounges they will not be getting their
piece of the tax revenue either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting stipulation I think
you might have a couple of votes down the
[SPEAKER_00]: line to bring that law back in when they
see the revenue that's gone into the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized territories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly yes and they do have that option
they can easily opt back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next thing I wanted to talk about was
community engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see the industry over in New
York at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a flourishing local scene in the
different five boroughs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there individual companies you kind of
see leading the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some of the Columbia Care purchased
there recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your overview of the community in
New York at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean I think a lot of scratching
our heads just watching too because like
[SPEAKER_01]: you just said the Columbia being you know
purchased so a lot of changing hands
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening with Etain so a lot of
questions out there who's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: dominate and that's a lot of you know a
lot of negative talk too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them don't want those registered
organizations or those multi-state to be
[SPEAKER_01]: monopolizing but I think we're going to
have some some good competition in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York especially because we have those
smaller licenses and we're seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: action across the entire state from east
to west with the legacy market right now
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're calling it a gray area so a lot of
people are setting up shop and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: really not quote-unquote legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you excited now have they given an
exact date for the first retail stores to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up in New York because I'm sure
there's a number of European travelers who
[SPEAKER_00]: are frequent visitors to New York who this
is going to be the icing on the cake to a
[SPEAKER_00]: trip to New York now for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I'd love to be able to tell you a date
but no we do not have an exact date we are
[SPEAKER_01]: just still trying to form the actual
regulations on how to set these license
[SPEAKER_01]: applications up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a few things that are going
faster social equity was written into our
[SPEAKER_01]: MRTA as a the main objective here in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to take our time and see
if we can get those social equity the 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: are supposed to go to a social equity
applicant of our licenses throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's taking a little bit of extra time
trying to get some things you know to go
[SPEAKER_01]: in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well I think that social equity piece
is a great nuance for investors who might
[SPEAKER_00]: have been getting into the industry to
certain individuals now who will have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to capital that may not have had
access to capital purely on the distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: that they got access to a license of head
of standardized companies which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah just trying to lower some barriers
you know so New York's trying to get very
[SPEAKER_01]: creative even as far as helping to fund
grants teaching you know really to be
[SPEAKER_01]: there and guide them don't want people to
fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a good educational program now I
think is essential for getting everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: up to speed on all the different dos and
don'ts for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely yeah and it's still so like I
said so many questions you know we know
[SPEAKER_01]: these are written in all these different
little programs and what we would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: do but it's just not formed yet so
everything is we say we're you know
[SPEAKER_01]: building the plane as we're flying it so
you know and it's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see if in your opinion do you
see a certain specific market in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: is it going to be flour is it going to be
vapes is it going to be edibles do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think it'll be health and wellness where
do you think the biggest sector is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in that market or is it going to be
tourism just a casual footfall going by
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary down in the midtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's a great question I think
tourism is going to be huge I do and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would also say flour I think we're going
to see New York possibly really stand out
[SPEAKER_01]: with their craft flour like they did with
their craft breweries and our wine country
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you look at the rest of the
state we're agricultural based so I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have some very talented may
we say you know cultivation in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah having lived there for a number of
years I definitely know for a fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a number of different
genetics I think that come out of New York
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to become popular global
strains and it'll emanate from some little
[SPEAKER_00]: basement in Brooklyn or the Bronx or
something like that it won't emanate from
[SPEAKER_00]: some lab in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah we're counting on that we're we
definitely have some wonderful legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: strains already so I'm sure the genetics
are going to continue at least that's our
[SPEAKER_01]: hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have you guys seen a CBD market over
there is the ability to buy CBD flour
[SPEAKER_00]: legal over there or is it just going from
illegality straight away into all
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is we really did have to fight on that
regulation because they did not want us to
[SPEAKER_01]: have flour for quite a while to be sold to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the compromise was no pre-rolls for the
hemp products for CBD flour but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: sell the actual flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay very interesting and it's what are
you looking forward to most now over the
[SPEAKER_00]: first nine months is at the opening of the
retail stores or is there something
[SPEAKER_00]: specific that we need to know about that's
going to be happening in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know this isn't to do with licensing
but I think I'm most excited about seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: our people be able to grow and cultivate
their own cannabis because with our
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation all adults 21 years and older
are going to be able to grow their own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gotta be honest that's my most
exciting you know weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's incredible you've got it the
potential for millions of young botanists
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to have their own plant and is
that a limit is there a specific amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that each individual person is
allowed to grow is there any rules set
[SPEAKER_00]: around that or is it just limited to a
certain amount of plants and you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is limited and again they're still
working on a lot of the regulations so and
[SPEAKER_01]: that is not going to be allowed until
after the first retail sales begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know it's going to be a little
while medical patients will be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow first and we're only looking at three
immature and three mature plants per adult
[SPEAKER_01]: right now and 12 maximum per home per
household but a lot of people aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to grow or won't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't feel it'll be a competition we're
just trying to help you know stop those
[SPEAKER_01]: those sales that have been going on and
have more access so that people who maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: can't afford their medicine can now be
able to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's been absolutely a thrilling talk
into your wealth of information for
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else wants to check more about the
cannabis community the website is down
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
