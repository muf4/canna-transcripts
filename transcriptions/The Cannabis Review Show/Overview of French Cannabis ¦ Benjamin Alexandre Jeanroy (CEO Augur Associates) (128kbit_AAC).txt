[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Benjamin Alexandre Jeanois,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is the CEO of Augur Associates over in
Paris in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the topic of today is going to be an
overview of the French cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Benjamin, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great coming back to work after a
little bit of a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: During Christmas, so it's great to be
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're either chomping at the bit to
get back from work after that break or it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes you another week or two to get
yourself into gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either one of those two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump straight into things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give everybody maybe a quick
little overview of how you got into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry and Augur Associates and
the services you guys provide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've been working for the past 10
years in drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working at the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for UNODC, the Office for Drugs
and Crime in Central America and Southeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came back to France about seven
years ago to work more on the civil
[SPEAKER_00]: society side of drug policy and more on
the influence and lobbying aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing leading to another was my
current partner, Aurelien.
[SPEAKER_00]: We co-created the professional hemp union
about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which gathered for the first time
professionals from the CBD and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sector in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very bargaining markets, both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the first professional
representation in order to have a united
[SPEAKER_00]: front to talk with place slaters and
elected officials and the administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Managed the union for about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced several groundbreaking white
papers that helped show and shaped both
[SPEAKER_00]: markets regulations in the year afters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about three years ago, we started to
create Augur Associates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to find a new way to accompany
the development of those ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea was really to create a
highly specialized group that was open to
[SPEAKER_00]: support companies from France and from
abroad that wanted to do business in CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: in medical cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do also love industrial hemp projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we work in France a lot,
but because of COVID, we started working a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot in other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're heading projects a little
bit of everywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a fantastic ride since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys seem to be at the central focal
point of the French industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wanted to bring you on to give
everybody a little clarity on the French
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had in November, 2020, the court of
justice of the European union confirmed
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD wasn't narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we had in November, 2021,
which is last year, a legal firm called
[SPEAKER_01]: Latham and Watkins with a lawyer,
Eveline von K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Muhlen, won a court case that basically
solidified that you could have 0.03
[SPEAKER_01]: percent in your CBD and you could use the
whole plant to process oils and to use for
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures, but then separately CBD flower
has been banned for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I summarized that correctly for where
we are at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So mostly, and David was sometimes in the
details, the 0.03 percent is not directly
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the cannabis case,
but more in the ongoing discussions as the
[SPEAKER_00]: reform for the agricultural common policy
from the EU that's we raised the bar at
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.03 percent, which it was prior to the
end of the 90s, where upon lobbying
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts from the agricultural French,
actually we lowered down at 0.02 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting to know that it's not so much
of a norm, but rather a limitation upon
[SPEAKER_00]: which farmers can receive subsidiaries
from that agricultural common policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other side, flowers is open to
sell, but only on B2B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issues is direct consumer sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so how would they see how would that
make sense that if B2B also, it's just the
[SPEAKER_01]: processing of flower, they're allowed to
sell flower to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can only you can understand that to
a degree with the similarities with THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flair being almost identical and the
police not being kind of informed enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to know the difference between
the two flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you see the official and the
official excuse?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behind that, behind that, we do know it's
a fallacy because it's not causing a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in many other countries where they
do have different markets and capacities
[SPEAKER_00]: for police forces to make the difference
through very useful and easy you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: easy use types of monitors and testing and
testing kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issue is a much more political plot
than than than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand that the context
right now, France is the one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: presidential campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everything is kind of tainted by
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Macron, for the past two years,
has went into a direction with his
[SPEAKER_00]: government in making clear that they
didn't want to legalise flowers from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hand markets because it would give too
much for them, the impression that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating legalising cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see what you've seen over in
Ireland here now, a number of the stores
[SPEAKER_01]: that are selling CBD flower have been
targeted directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of other people
around Europe that we've talked to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be that the industry for
selling CBD flower will only be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: flourish when a recreational market is
actually in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that being the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because I think it's already
flourishing and it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever governments want to try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's take the example of France.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past three years, there's been,
you know, up and downs of repression
[SPEAKER_00]: against retailers, mainly of CBD flowers
with, you know, back and forth in that in
[SPEAKER_00]: that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's never been what we call in France
a long fleuve tranquille, a long tranquil
[SPEAKER_00]: river.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea right now is that it's directly
forbidden by the French government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people consider that it's a
contradiction to the European,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, flow goods, of commerce goods,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to see a lot of
movements in the legal aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there is a need right
now, or even if it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany aside, you know, there isn't a lot
of European countries that are moving into
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction of complete cannabis
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see, you know, a use and a
commerce of hemp flowers a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that depending on the
country regulation, the market is more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less open.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be existing because in
France, even if very hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_00]: they stop selling flowers in every retail
stores on the on the territory,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still online marketplaces,
you know, and suffice to change your
[SPEAKER_00]: website to put it on another server in
another country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of, you know,
contradictions and issues with the new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my take is that it's not going to
hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it might take, you know, a couple of
years still to get a proper regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: back in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you see the European ruling within
time being the de facto ruling across all
[SPEAKER_01]: the European nations and the governments
will just have to abide by it because we
[SPEAKER_01]: can see a number of different core cases
from flower sellers happening all across
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the argument isn't going to be able to
withstand, do you think, over a long
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I come from drug policies
and drug policies, when you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: science, look at the data, you know,
that prohibition, you know, whatever is a
[SPEAKER_00]: substance, usually don't work and creates,
you know, unfathomable negative
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences that are much more harmful
than the than the products in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a sense of denying
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these products exist,
the use of these products exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we take the flower, the flower,
it haven't, you know, have flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It even has been a very strong,
you know, helpful capacity in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: substitute more harmful products to this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can consider that, you know,
the wave is going to move forward at which
[SPEAKER_00]: speed and what is going to be the tempo is
going to change depending on each country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think, indeed, that there is no
way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if the market is not properly
legally regulated, it's going to be taken
[SPEAKER_00]: by the black market and black market don't
care about quality products, don't care
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, which age they're selling
their products to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there's no taxes and all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a question about just recognizing
reality and how can we reduce the harm of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential harmful products to the maximum
and not denying that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those products and their users exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, couldn't agree with you more on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump on to the second topic that
I want to talk to you about, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting edge of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the people that I've talked to so
far, you can kind of start to paint a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture that Malta are becoming one of the
leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got an enterprise board that have
a million euro tech fund for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark have their ornamental flower
industry, which gets backed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, no doubt, are renowned
entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the recent news, we'll have a
number of different cutting edge
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you see as the kind of the foremost
experts in Europe when it comes to this
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting edge technology in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a specific company or two
that you think everybody should keep an
[SPEAKER_01]: eye on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sad truth, I think,
is Europe is lagging behind a lot in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to, you know, what's going on
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada, and especially in Israel in
terms of, you know, R&D and kind of tech
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're lagging behind a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very hard to find, you know,
and I think it's a great news because it
[SPEAKER_00]: means that the leader spot in that domain
is yet to be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to the government that will put
in place the sufficient and proper
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation in order to foster proper R&D
and entrepreneurship into those markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Denmark is doing great things on
the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany is going to be the central
actor and the norm maker for many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, medical and social use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in both of things, they're going
to become the leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the U.K.
[SPEAKER_00]: as a vibrant ecosystem that is,
you know, more or less being helped by
[SPEAKER_00]: their own national regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an interesting market to
explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's great research that is
being done in Spain right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the countries to look
at it for, you know, clinical and
[SPEAKER_00]: observational studies of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, you know, we'll have things
in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have great people working on
genetics, manipulation, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the greatest, you know,
frontier that we're going to have in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to have personalized medicine in cannabis,
which is, I think, the way to go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the competition is only
starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Israel are the tip of the spear at
the moment when it comes to the R&D in
[SPEAKER_01]: this sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe has a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I said, I think when Europe does
get going, I think we're going to put on a
[SPEAKER_01]: turbo skates and we'll catch up fairly
quickly, if not exceed some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: territories already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope Ireland becomes one of the dominant
players like we are in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're the stepping stone between
North America and Europe for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: services and various other segments that
the industry put.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an exciting 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got ahead for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, working in cannabis is
never tranquil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always new things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it helps build resilience,
which I think is the number one quality
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need to have to work into those
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's incredible because we're building
as we're making it, you know, it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: creating new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each client that we work with,
it's kind of a new challenge and a
[SPEAKER_00]: different service that we haven't
reproduced or done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we can help build the
ecosystem in order to have weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because today, you know, we're not,
you know, taken seriously by some
[SPEAKER_00]: governments because it's still a fairly
small industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the growth behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in, you know, we're quite certain
that the balance will shift and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to move that shift as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we just come up to our 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking forward to talking to
you a while, Benjamin, and it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: disappoint too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a clear and precise, informed
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much for taking your
time out of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who wants to know more about
Agour Associates, you can see the website
[SPEAKER_01]: there, a higher end, check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a big European business,
you should be given get in contact with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Benjamin, you have a great rest of
your day and hopefully we can talk in a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of months and see where France is
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure exchanging with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward in watching the new
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much and bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
