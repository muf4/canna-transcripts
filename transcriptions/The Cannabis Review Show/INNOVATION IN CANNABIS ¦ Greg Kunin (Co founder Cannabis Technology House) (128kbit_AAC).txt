[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Greg Koonin who is a co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis technology house over in Israel
and Tel Aviv.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've already had a wealth of
experience in the industry from being a
[SPEAKER_00]: product director, product at Altria
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you got to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are with the company you're in at the
cannabis technology house?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I joined a company, an Israeli company
that was called Greensmoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in the e-cigarette space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That company later on got acquired by
Altria, which is the largest tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: company in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really focused on innovation,
creating new products, ways to help people
[SPEAKER_01]: convert from combustible cigarettes that
are the most harmful to products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few years ago, me and a few
colleagues saw what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we decided that we want to be
entrepreneurs for this opportunity,
[SPEAKER_01]: not employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically took all the knowledge we
got in terms of how you create innovation
[SPEAKER_01]: for regulated space.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you balance out the consumer,
the regulator and the business side?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to apply it to the cannabis
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically how we came up with
our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's named Kube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a heat not burn product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to go to heat not burn,
where basically you heat up the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of burning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're still using authentic flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not using artificial liquids or
something like that, because we've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: that that platform is the most successful
in terms of converting people from
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion products to something that's
less harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these little cubes inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 0.2 grams of cannabis
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the user needs to do is put them
in this device, give it a little press,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the device is ready to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it switches off automatically once the
session is completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they finish, they just dispose of
the capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can pop another one right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no cleaning, no hassle
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're planning to commercialize this
in the United States this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some real innovation in the space of
consumption inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're telling me there is this going
to be like espresso pods where I can just
[SPEAKER_00]: clip in a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to get rid of any of the
nastiness that normally comes with putting
[SPEAKER_00]: flour into a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nespresso model is exactly what we're
going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I acknowledge that there's a lot of people
who are aficionados.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like dealing with the big vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think there's a large audience that
just want the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we saw that there's this huge
innovation in terms of strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can now find a strain that at least
claims that they can solve every problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, in terms of how to consume it,
half of the markets are still joined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're mostly focused on the
recreational space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even in the medical space,
it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to the doctor and you say,
well, I have a health problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, OK, here is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your way to consume it is going to
long term create another big health
[SPEAKER_01]: problem for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys have this consumption method,
inhalation method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain the heat not burn part
that is a core component?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the fact that it's just the capsule
that's being connected to it is allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the heat to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what is the exact engineering behind
the process?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll speak a little bit about the
technology itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heat not burn is a technology that's
already being applied in the tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: space, mostly by Icos that was developed
by Philip Morse International.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was one of the first products
that were approved by the FDA as a reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: risk product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was authorized to be on the US market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea in heat not burn is,
OK, we want to get the sensory experience
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the experience is not right,
people are not going to shift to our
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter how less harmful it
is, people are just not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the idea is saying,
let's take real authentic tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of burning it, we'll just heat
it up to the point where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: components, all the oil is released and a
person can inhale it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we never bring it to the point of
combustion where all the main harm is
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main harm from smoking is not
necessarily nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly the people inhaling something
that was combusting, something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our logic was we wanted to apply the
same technology in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in a smarter way, because it has been
applied through vaporizers like Pax and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mighty and Crafty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main issue we saw there is really
for the consumer, you spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not cheap, the devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically, you work for the
device.
[SPEAKER_01]: The device doesn't work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You work cleaning in all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get to a point where it
doesn't matter how much you clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The experience is not the same as it was
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also not great for regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that in nicotine, the open tanks
that are defined by the FDA's open
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, they basically told retailers
that if you sell this, you'll need to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply by the same standard as the
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw a lot of vape stores go out of
business because they just couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: comply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also bottom line, it's not good
business because you spend all these
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts selling people this expensive
device, but then you can't really offer
[SPEAKER_01]: them your own flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to solve a couple of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, what we did, we moved the heater from
the device.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you would see a lot in Pax and
Crafty, you have a very large device and
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be like an oven inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved it to the consumable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one of these capsules have their
own little heater that allows us to
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly reduce the size of the
device.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the consumer is getting a fresh
experience every time because it's a fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: heater every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also took away everything that has
to do with cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really we wanted to create something
that's 100% focused on the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have to clean anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All he needs to do is charge the device,
pop in a capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for business because it's very kind
of classic razor and blades model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also good for regulation because we
know exactly what goes inside every
[SPEAKER_01]: capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: We control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to measure how many were
sold and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know the more you kind of picture
in your mind, the more genius it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a future where instead of
going in to buy 20 cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going in and selecting from
cartridges that have different flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: different various cannabinoid and terpene
profiles in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a silica blue smoker at the
moment or a John Player blue smoker,
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a relevant strain and
application to pop into your own
[SPEAKER_00]: individual consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very similar to what you said
with an espresso association.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the capsules and you know
that, you know, the brown one is stronger
[SPEAKER_01]: and the green one is decapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long term, that's where we want to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another big component we integrated
inside this, it's a technology called
[SPEAKER_01]: topography, basically allows us to know
when did the consumer took a puff,
[SPEAKER_01]: how long was the puff and create kind of
the ideal temperature profile for each
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So later down the line, what we want to do
is basically, let's say you buy a red
[SPEAKER_01]: capsule and that's a certain strain of THC
and you know what the effect is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The device would recognize the capsule and
automatically adjust the performance
[SPEAKER_01]: setting of the device.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, really go in taking as far as we
can, the strategy of the consumer doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the experience for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: While at the same time, obviously making
sure that it's something that can pass for
[SPEAKER_01]: future regulations and something you can
build a scalable business on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I think you've got,
regardless of what consumer bracket you
[SPEAKER_00]: fit into as a cannabis consumer,
you're going to have your at home smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, your traveling smoking profile,
your profile with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that device can fit into a
number of different scenarios,
[SPEAKER_00]: not trying to overtake one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have a place in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always a story I tell when
people try to better understand the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say every person who have kids,
they know that there's a time and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: right after your kids go to sleep and it's
right before you collapse because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that point of time you would like
to relax, but not to the extent that if
[SPEAKER_01]: your kids wake up, you're not really able
to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how the idea of really,
you know, working in cubes that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: very small 0.2 grams inside of them came
to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you decide if your tea or coffee
is sweet enough, you put a sugar cube
[SPEAKER_01]: inside and you taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we basically took the traditional
joint and just broke it down to five
[SPEAKER_01]: cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can decide if you want a fifth of
a joint, two fifths, or you want the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is another layer of kind of
intuitive control for the consumer instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, letting them study on their
own, how to adjust resistance and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just felt it's more intuitive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think a big part of getting
this to be a global consumer industry will
[SPEAKER_00]: have the dosage right for people who don't
know or have no education.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the industry that they can feel safe
knowing that they go to you're making me
[SPEAKER_00]: jealous, taking a hit off that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can organize shipments to Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking of regulation, we we had
experienced some issues with the PACT Act
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States, but Europe luckily
is a much more understanding market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then let me move on to the last topic,
the regulatory process that you guys got
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the equivalent of FDA approval,
EU approval?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting certain territory or is it
individual countries that you have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: approval from for the device?
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, it's one big mess right now,
because even the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one country, but it's different
regulations in every state.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did, we basically took everything
we know from regulation of the FDA defines
[SPEAKER_01]: electron nicotine delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a process of pre-market
approval for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically took that as our blueprint
for what we need to take into
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that it needs to be a closed
system where the consumer can just put
[SPEAKER_01]: anything inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that there are certain tests we
need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we need to show that this is
not going to appeal to the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: audiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just proactively kind of did an
exercise at the early days of saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, let's just replace the FDA
regulation of electronic nicotine delivery
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just replace the word nicotine with
cannabis and see where we land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really would grow our regulatory
strategy from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, at the moment there are
regulations in every market, but usually
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens is the FDA will eventually
regulate this once it becomes federally in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'll be kind of standard
regulation and usually other countries
[SPEAKER_01]: will follow whatever the FDA does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now in the United States,
there's nuances to each market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most important thing, it's not to
sit down and read every law, it's to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the logic and what the
regulator is trying to prevent and the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulator is trying to prevent a few
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One and the most important thing is that
this is used by the target audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't end up in situations where
some e-cigarette company landed where the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing basically kind of jeopardize the
entire business because they intentionally
[SPEAKER_01]: or unintentionally reached the wrong
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one, you need to make sure that
you know what's inside and that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then most importantly is that people
are really going to move from a harmful
[SPEAKER_01]: product, which is combustion, and it's no
different from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically for nicotine, the FDA has a
spectrum of harm where not smoking is
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously the best and a combustible
cigarette is the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to show that your product is
going to help people move from something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is more harmful to something that is
less harmful and not just going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for an example, have them use
both joints and a reduced harm product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is to really show conversion,
which was also one of the reasons we felt
[SPEAKER_01]: heat not burn is the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you add CBD flour or hash is to what
you put into these things relevant or is
[SPEAKER_00]: it coming specifically from your own?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you can put in a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll clarify, not everything you could put
in the joint, anything you should put in a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint, you can put into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we operate as a technology company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we partner up with cannabis companies
that have cultivation, that have that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we work with them to identify kind of
the perfect settings for their blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Theoretically, even in the earlier days,
we even tested it with tobacco just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as a startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also as a category, you can't really taste
cannabis and stay focused for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tobacco was a good alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even worked with tobacco, not that we
have any plans to go into this space,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, essentially any type of flower
springs, whether it's CBD or THC works
[SPEAKER_01]: well with the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like one of the proper
innovations that I've seen over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: few years in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish you guys the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come to our time now, but thank you
very much for coming on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out the device and
everything about cannabis technology
[SPEAKER_00]: house, you can see the website down below
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be in all the links, whether you're
listening to it or watching it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see it below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again for watching and Greg chat
to you again next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to get an update off your
buddy in the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Okay.
