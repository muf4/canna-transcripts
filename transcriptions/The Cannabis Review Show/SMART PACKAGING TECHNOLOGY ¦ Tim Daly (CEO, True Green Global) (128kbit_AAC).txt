[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join this episode by Tim
Daly who is the CEO of True Green Global
[SPEAKER_01]: over in America, a smart packaging
technology company.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Tim?
[SPEAKER_00]: All is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much and happy New Year to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are one of the hot new companies
in the American industry at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of your history and business to
[SPEAKER_01]: date and how you ended up at True Green
Global?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my career has been spent in IoT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in creating smart objects, smart rooms,
typically to add value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the typically used case is supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So digitizing physical objects,
digitizing physical rooms to track things
[SPEAKER_00]: as they move through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially moving terrestrial data
sets into the cloud for value,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be knowing where things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do accurate, instantaneous
inventory counts, cycle counts,
[SPEAKER_00]: or creating intelligent objects that know
exactly who they are, where they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can provide some sort of value for an
end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use cases like authentication,
tamper detection, open and close messages,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moving on to True Green Global,
in terms of the supply chain, where it is
[SPEAKER_01]: do you see the True Green Global adds
value to the supply chain?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting in cannabis,
it's truly a broken industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nascent industry in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike traditional industries,
manufacturing, government, retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: globally that use best practices in supply
chain, cannabis is an area that where the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain is effectively broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's currently an analog process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have individuals touching every
item, scanning them with a barcode reader,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them down and touching the next
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an industry that's highly regulated
like cannabis, where there's a requirement
[SPEAKER_00]: to do individual unit counts, cycle
counts, et cetera, either on a daily,
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly, or quarterly basis, when you have
the human element involved, there's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a significant amount of errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a simple matter to take the best
practices of supply chain that are used
[SPEAKER_00]: globally and bring them into an industry,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, that direly needs them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates incredible efficiencies,
saves time, saves money, reduces all those
[SPEAKER_00]: errors, and helps keep businesses
compliant with the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from my research as well, it seems you
guys are adding value at the payment side
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you elaborate a little bit on that for
the audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an exciting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've recently acquired a company that had
over the last three years built out a
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper ledger fabric payment solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this solution was specifically built
for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned a minute ago,
the supply chain side has been broken in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The payment side as well is broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the United States, so there's
truly no effective legal efficient low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost payment solution available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, part of this goes to the fact
that cannabis is currently a scheduled and
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal substance at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there just are no payment solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ATM solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're skating on the edge of
legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that on the other side
that we brought, of course, is the payment
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've purchased this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the first stable coin blockchain
payment solution that instead of skirting
[SPEAKER_00]: the SEC in the United States, they went
directly to the SEC about three years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with the SEC to prove that this
solution is truly a security and should be
[SPEAKER_00]: registered and regulated by the SEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this solution is the first ever global
approved SEC stable coin payment solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the most simplistic sense,
because everything I just said is very
[SPEAKER_00]: technical and confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But suffice to say, we are rolling out in
the first quarter of this year within the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, a Starbucks Starbucks app
like payment solution for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So download your Starbucks app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You answer some basic questions because
this is an SEC registered security.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to answer the know your
customer rule, anti-money laundering rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that's done, you'll connect
your bank account to the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll upload, let's say, $100 like you
would in Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That $100 is directly deposited into U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: money market account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll walk into your dispensary,
make your purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll show your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The budtender will scan the phone and
remove from your wallet those dollars for
[SPEAKER_00]: your purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all is good for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all done using an SEC approved
patented stable coin platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the key word from that is
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I researched into the company,
the more it is that you guys are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: providing four key solutions for
businesses across the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to move now on to the smart
packaging side of things and the
[SPEAKER_01]: technology behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people might have heard of near field
communication with the ultra high
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency radio frequency identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe elaborate on what is behind
the technology so everybody could
[SPEAKER_01]: understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UHF, ultra high frequency RFID is the
global standard for digitizing individual
[SPEAKER_00]: objects and then tracking them throughout
the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RFID.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well seen and well used across all
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the real good examples
of that would be the large retailer,
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Walmart requires that every product
that is shipped into Walmart, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: exception of grocery items, has to have an
RFID tag on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose is it allows for simple
frictionless intaking of objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use an RFID scanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You scan it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sees every individual object in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It immediately connects that to their
point of sale and inventory systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those products are then moved into some
sort of inventory room in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be fixed readers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scan the room automatically every
second or so and see all of the objects
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then can reconcile that
immediately with what's supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what's supposed to be where we
know exactly where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when then those objects move from the
inventory room onto the onto the floor of
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual retailer, we can see as they
move from here onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know where things are at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides incredible business
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces things like product stockouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces things like over inventorying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to tie up all your money
in inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be incredibly efficient with what
you have and knowing where it is at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that effectively is a global standard
for digitizing objects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems that you guys offer complete
security in the supply chain, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: lacking to a degree in a number of states
and somewhat in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're operational in a number of big
states in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've always said that you
can have a business that is regulated or
[SPEAKER_00]: the states mandate your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what our approach has always been
that we need to to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to go to operatives,
whether it's a producer, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary or a vertically integrated SSO
or MSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to truly add value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to save the money, keep them
compliant, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our customers are finding huge savings,
incredible efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was nice is in Maryland the other
day, one of the the officers who performed
[SPEAKER_00]: the regular audits came in and saw our
solution in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were extraordinarily excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took samples back and they want to
try to propose that that type of solution
[SPEAKER_00]: be mandated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all producers and dispensaries in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for the regulators to know where
the product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regulators can now walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have their own handheld RFID
scanners and they can scan a room
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can then reconcile that with what's
supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by digitizing objects with ultra high
frequency RFID, you offer value to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: You offer value to the producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You offer value to the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, it ultimately
becomes valuable to the customers because
[SPEAKER_00]: one, with all these efficiencies,
you can save money and therefore sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: product at a lower price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, the customers know that these are
legal tested products that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: through the legal supply chain and that
they've not come in from the gray markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, every stakeholder in the
cannabis world benefits from digitizing
[SPEAKER_00]: individual cannabis units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems as automation and robotics
come into the manufacturing and packaging
[SPEAKER_01]: and distribution side of the industry that
your technology is tailor made for these
[SPEAKER_01]: advancements that are coming in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, machines, these these things have
to speak to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a good example of that,
that personally from my career,
[SPEAKER_00]: before I was working in cannabis,
I put together, helped sell in and build
[SPEAKER_00]: and deploy the entire automation system
for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Tesla, there were all these
inefficiencies because they were using
[SPEAKER_00]: barcode scanners by adding RFID to all
individual bins, racks, and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: individual items like battery pallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to track where everything
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They created incredible efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you needed the red door to come
in for that Model S at a certain time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you knew that the red door left the
inventory room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the gateways that goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you knew that that product was going to
be there when it needed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about creating efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to automate,
you have to have systems that will speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other and understand the data and
the outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of talk about the DEA
rescheduling over the last number of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen the stocks of a lot of the MSOs
take a little bump, which was well needed
[SPEAKER_01]: for anybody who's got its skin in the game
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think within the first Q1 of
this year that we're going to end up
[SPEAKER_01]: having some positive feedback from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is pointing towards something
positive, whether it's scheduling down to
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule three or whether it's a full
federal legalization plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, everybody hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think this this
administration desperately needs a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of hope that they
would be a much more favorable or pro
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the of course, the expectation is that
the DEA will provide a favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: rescheduling ruling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally speaking, I don't hold out
any short term hope for legislators or
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians to get something done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hold out hope that there will be a
rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by rescheduling it from a one to a
type three substance, that's a game
[SPEAKER_00]: changer for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it frees up cash flow allows for
their standard 280 exemptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will be a true game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, to your point, you can see
that that's starting to be built in in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small way into some of these stocks,
these publicly traded cannabis stocks
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems the winner is if we do end up
getting federal legalization, the brands
[SPEAKER_01]: will be the kind of dominant players in
the industry like it is in beverages and
[SPEAKER_01]: and in any consumer packaged goods side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard numbers from some of
the larger publicly traded MSOs on what a
[SPEAKER_00]: rescheduling would do to their balance
sheet in terms of cash flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a night and day change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the challenge again, the challenge for
the industry and one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_00]: they have not adopted best practices is it
requires capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these businesses are are well
underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last year has been a very difficult
environment for attracting outside capital
[SPEAKER_00]: come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a rescheduling that will free up
significant free cash flow day one and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will allow these businesses to make
investments and things that will create
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiencies and and ultimately provide a
better experience for all stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, year 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we get Germany's industry starts
getting some momentum and we see some
[SPEAKER_01]: change happen in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look forward to seeing Truglian
global dominate on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our our goal is to bring to to
to fix the broken parts of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, it's the supply chain
side and it's the payment side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, UHF RFID is not truly inventing
the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just bringing to bear in cannabis
tried and true best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from supply chain and we're
adopting and adapting it to the nuance and
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we see that we're changing customers
and improving their their bottom line and
[SPEAKER_00]: their efficiencies across their entire
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's thrilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fun time to be in the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been incredible talking to Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we get to touch base down Q2 of
this year and we can get an update.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got some positive news in
America for anybody who is not being the
[SPEAKER_01]: true green global's website.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link is below and it will be in the
description wherever you watch or view
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend following them on
social media and go to visit their site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tim, thank you very much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a wonderful day and a wonderful
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
Oh.
