[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined this episode by
Nayoum Philippe Osbina, who's the Director
[SPEAKER_00]: of Business Development at Colombian
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Nayoum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of your history in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to date and your position at
Colombian Organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right now I've been working in the
cannabis industry for five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working in commercial,
in projects, in the production,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the section.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now I'm making the commercial
part since like three, four years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: working in this difficult industry that's
not easy, and especially here in Colombia,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, you have all the laws,
you have the government and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my experience goes especially to
commercialize and the marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising of the cannabis industry,
and of course, helping all the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell their products, airway,
flowers, extractions, whatever they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: First topic I wanted to jump on was
basically an overview of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody, I know we
had it was medical in 2016, industrial in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019, and then potentially an adult use
market now in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe tell everybody how expensive
is the medical program currently and do
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a rough number of patients that
are on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right now the problem with the
medical program is that it's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not working together with the
companies and the government and the
[SPEAKER_01]: health companies here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The access is still really difficult to
the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really bureaucratic for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So medical cannabis right now in Colombia
is specializing in cosmetics and other
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of products that are not like
medical, like the pharmaceutical products
[SPEAKER_01]: we were waiting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, especially for the technology
we have here also, we don't have like all
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff and all the people for the kind
of products that we need for a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical product to the medical
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about the industrial hemp,
for example, we don't have so developed
[SPEAKER_01]: the market for these kind of products
because we don't have the extensions in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like all the land and it's really
good and Colombia has really good
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is the extensions and the
machinery that you need for this
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction for the hemp that is really
different from the USA that they have so
[SPEAKER_01]: big volume of this hemp production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now that you tell it,
last week we lost the chance to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: approval of the adult use in Colombia
because the Congress, it didn't pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't pass the bill from the Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just missed it for five votes of the
Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have time this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to present it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe next year we have the good news
for the adult use in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you tell me what makes Colombian
organics so special in the expertise areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the best part from Colombia is the
experience that we have in flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have in flowers and genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have really good experience because we
have been working with flowers like 70
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago when we started from different
kind of flowers like roses, sunflowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: tulipons, those kind of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that experience were translated to
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have these low cost jobs for the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really low cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The land is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fertile for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The procedures, we are used to
agricultural procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only thing that we are missing
right now is like the company overview or
[SPEAKER_01]: the company we see like farmers farming,
but not a company itself, a big
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to understand has farmers,
has a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you see a lot of talk in Europe and
I'm sure a lot of investors talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia are going to be a future supplier
for the European side of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the lack of technological equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the thing that's hindering large
scale export from Colombia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of the lack of technology as
always, because we are always talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about Colombia and Latin America as the
raw material suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what we need to transform here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to focus on high technology
products, added value products,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just the raw material.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening right now, we are being
or we are seeing in Europe as the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: material in the case of dry flour,
for example, that is just the first step
[SPEAKER_01]: in the process of the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's happening right now,
we are just stopping in that time of the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment, the same that happened with
coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: With coffee, a couple of years were like
just making raw material, raw material and
[SPEAKER_01]: exporting the raw material to bring back a
final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need to do with the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now we're not too many years
making the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, but the lack of technology is
something that is really difficult here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there are certifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you in conversations before that
certifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important for us because we
are a company or we are a country from
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers don't have, they don't not used to
work with big companies, big procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big enterprises, so they don't understand
these about the certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you talk with some farmers here about
GACP, they don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And imagine that we need to make some
final products with a GMP, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what is GMP and they don't
know what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the problem also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we discussed before, I think it's
truly we're the only company with the GMP
[SPEAKER_00]: certification, is it in Colombia?
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest are the model is to export to
somewhere like Malta and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: facility in Malta will have EU GMP
certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only solution that we have
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one company here with the GMP
and they even had to bring someone from
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany to get that certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big problem and that says a
lot from a country that it's supposed that
[SPEAKER_01]: is specializing in the cannabis industry
that we don't have GMP certifications
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are making the other companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the GACP certification from
national companies, from national
[SPEAKER_01]: institutes and take it abroad to Malta,
Portugal, where they transform into GMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a certain certification
that's required for export into the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, not because, you know,
the USA market is just opening doors to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Latin American market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just asking for the total panel,
the quality panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, heavy metal, pesticides,
microbiology, all that panel of the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are not asking right now for
certifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is a difficult country,
but they are just asking for GACP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the minimum that you must.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw recently one of your posts and it
was a good question that I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the kind of successful countries in
Latin and South America has been Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me what Colombia can learn
from the Uruguayan model?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I saw it in the post.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were really close with the
institute in Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uruguay is a three million population
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really easy to them to work with
the companies really close with the
[SPEAKER_01]: institute, with the National Institute for
Seeds, with the National Institute that is
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating right now the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that relations so close with
regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have many institutes that is in charge
of the procedures and you need to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: procedure here, a procedure in another
institute, but they are not connected
[SPEAKER_01]: between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really difficult this connection
with the institutes of the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is that they specialize
in the first moment or in the first year,
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding the needs of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really understood that since the
first moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that implies, for example,
that they brought genetics from
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland, from Europe, and they are
cultivating those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they understood that if you want
to export to Europe, you need the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the genetics that you like from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really good point to learn from
Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to Colombia on the
extraction side of things, we obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you guys are world class at the
farming and cultivation side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many extraction facilities exist in
Colombia and do they excel at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: level as the cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not at the same level of the
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're missing a lot of companies making
extraction here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens, for example,
the cost of extraction here is really
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really high because of the
volume, because of the technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, because of the relationship
between the companies, as I told you.
[SPEAKER_01]: More or less right now that I can
remember, maybe more than 400 license for
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, 400 license for extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from those 400, just operating,
really, really operating, no more than 50
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really difficult for the
extraction companies here because the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, the volume is not really good for
the expensive that it represents to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract here, different from the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the USA, you have a big company,
a big factory making extraction because
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a lot of hemp for that
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The extraction, for example, here,
the full spectrum or broad spectrum is
[SPEAKER_01]: more expensive here, even if the flower is
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the process of extraction is really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company you work for, Colombian
Organics, you have more than 25 years
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in this sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe explain what sets up
Colombian Organics differently from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other companies that are in Colombia and
what the future ambitions for the company
[SPEAKER_00]: may be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't assume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't assume it really well in two
words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics on flowers, the experience of
flowers from the company, because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a familiar company and the family has been
working with flowers from 50 years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: from a recognized company here in Bogota,
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But genetics, genetics is like the main
point for them because they specialize in
[SPEAKER_01]: making that phenol hunting, taking the
best genetics to the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the best procedures for these
reproduction of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we have right now seeds in
the UK, in Thailand, soon in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have also the seeds and soon in
Argentina for the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we know or we are recognized
in Europe and in the market because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and the trust of all that is
the company working with genetics because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's not easy working with
genetics because it's not the final
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a product that you are going to have
after the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the trust that the companies or the
owners of the company have been making
[SPEAKER_01]: with this company, with all the commercial
affairs, it's really good and they trust,
[SPEAKER_01]: people trust on them and in the experience
from the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the political
overview in Colombia, we see around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world that it's generally the democratic
side of the politics are leaning towards
[SPEAKER_00]: an adult use market and the conservatives
are more on just a medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the same in Colombia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it happens the same in some ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why last week we lost the
opportunity to regulate the adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the conservative party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were saying like, no, we deny that
option because they have all these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: talks that it's not for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in one way or another, the world needs
to regulate the regulation of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more the benefits than the bad when
you make it and results show it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is a good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uruguay is the best example, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfect, but it's better than
having a black market on the streets with
[SPEAKER_01]: the kids, with all the bad and the
negative part of the black market in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last question before I let you go,
what are the top two things that you look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to seeing over the next couple of
years happening in Colombia?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing is that the farmers
understand that they are working with
[SPEAKER_01]: companies internationally, that they need
to understand they need to see themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves as enterprises, big companies
with procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do good productions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second one, understand the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't understand the market,
you could have the best production,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best production plans and the best
production projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's useful if you don't have the
market, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man,
so I'm going to let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for taking your
time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you to you and have a good day
and good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
