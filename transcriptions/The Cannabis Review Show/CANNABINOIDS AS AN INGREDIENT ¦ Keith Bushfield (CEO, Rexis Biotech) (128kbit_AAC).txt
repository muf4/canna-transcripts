[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Keith Bushfield who's the CEO of Rex's
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Keith?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good and yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for taking your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of your career to date and how
[SPEAKER_00]: you found yourself at Rex's Biotech?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, you know, serial entrepreneur,
came out of school and realized,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I didn't want to go down a law
school path.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to go down some of the
things that I thought were predetermined
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really got in the entrepreneurial
space, did a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started a biotech firm in 2009
and that managed to morph into another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and another thing approached by a
few different companies to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: what could we use our technology or could
we use our technology in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started to do some experimentation
and here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2002, or sorry, 2022, Rex's was
founded and it took multiple technologies
[SPEAKER_01]: from different entities, from different
people, put them together to produce what
[SPEAKER_01]: we do today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are a biotech firm that really
specializes in taking hydrophobic
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules, molecules that don't assimilate
in water and having them assimilate in
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a thing like cannabis is a perfect
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take that hydrophobic molecule,
stick it into our process, comes out the
[SPEAKER_01]: other end in a fine white powder and that
powder is now fully stable in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we remove taste, smell, a lot of the
profiles that are off putting with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but at the same time,
keeping a lot of the mechanisms for
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of knew from the start of the
beverage side of the industry that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid molecules were either sticking
to aluminium or were settling in a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific part of the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are part of this new wave of
technology that's allowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to distribute throughout the
product and give an exact kind of dosage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest problem with the, I'll call it
cannabis beverages, 1.0 or 2.0 or three,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're probably onto, you know,
round 20 by now, but the original
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, the early companies either just
put oil into the beverage, which is just
[SPEAKER_01]: like salad dressing oil and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It floats to the top, doesn't assimilate,
tastes terrible, all the things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: bad with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they got more sophisticated and they
use sonification, high shear, a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different things that have been
in the pharmaceutical industry for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problem is it used a surfactant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a surfactant is basically just a
chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are more organic base than others,
but it's still just a chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use that surfactant to bond the
molecule to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just an artificial way to hold it
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with surfactants, they come
apart, so they don't hold very well and it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't take long for them to separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other issue with those is the
flavour is very off putting, that chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes in there, it's hard to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the old days, you would get colas or
root beer or other coffee things to try
[SPEAKER_01]: and hide the cannabis flavour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with our technology, we use,
our trade name is fused polymorph
[SPEAKER_01]: nanofiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we make a co-crystal of the cannabis
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we make multiple molecules fused
together in a permanent fuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't come apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take our ingredient,
put it into water, put it into a beverage
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever you're going to use,
put it into food, and it will not separate
[SPEAKER_01]: over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got pharmaceutical studies,
two years stability in water without
[SPEAKER_01]: separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty well unheard of in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think why our path to growth
has been so fast because we have this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's different than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where the market needs
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like in every industry, we limp along
until we make some breakthroughs in
[SPEAKER_01]: different industries or different
technologies and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to see other companies
dabble in trying to make it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beverage space is where the growth
is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis has been around in a bunch of
different industries before this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was limited, I think, from
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we've introduced this technology,
it's growing at light speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the first wave of the
cannabis industry was cultivated flour
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't seem that the first mover
advantage is going to end up working in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be that the reluctance for a
lot of big brands to get into this was,
[SPEAKER_00]: A, the ingredient of a cannabinoid,
where biotech companies now are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: use fermentation engineering to make this
molecule safe, stable, replicable over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are delivering the mechanism
for the distribution of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would it be right in saying that the
future of the industry after this wave is
[SPEAKER_00]: the brands, the people who come up with
the brands, tell the stories and connect
[SPEAKER_00]: with their customers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you couldn't put it any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't put it any better than what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been preaching this since 2016-17.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this mad rush for everybody to
be cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we got a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a million dollars for this one,
10 million for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said from day one, it's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as we get economies of scale,
whoever sells the best for the cheapest
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of money will continue to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be zero profit margin left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use this example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea who makes the hops or the
grain or the sugar or the canning
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know any of that, but I know
Budweiser and I don't care who made all
[SPEAKER_01]: the other stuff, but the brand is what is
worth the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have situations like Canada or
Canada eliminated branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a big mistake for their
industry because if you can't,
[SPEAKER_01]: if all the packages have to look the same,
there's no branding differentiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So branding of a product in that scenario
maybe is equal, but in the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world or primarily in the United States
right now, branding is starting to become
[SPEAKER_01]: the most key place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to see branding that
doesn't look like the old cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: branding where somebody was high and built
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is full on like, we make products
that look like full retail off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coca-Cola made this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's getting away from the old
fashioned way, building a brand that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: long life, building a brand that is
resonates with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And key, which I think is the brand is not
a fringe anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a discussion with someone recently
about gummies and they said, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: gummies are outpaced beverages always
will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I don't think so because
gummies, yes, I've been around for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but gummies are associated with
children's vitamins or vitamins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not a lot of other things,
but when someone says, Oh, I had a gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing comes to mind is,
Oh, I snuck a gummy and I had cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that doesn't know about
cannabis and all that has that reputation
[SPEAKER_01]: of, or that image of what cannabis and
gummies are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if I give someone one of these,
we've been drinking RTDs ready to drink
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages our entire lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can drink this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is now a transition between someone
that's never tried cannabis and someone
[SPEAKER_01]: that has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone that can try five milligram dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like drinking a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a slight intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not, you know, eating too,
because the first one didn't work and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at purple dinosaurs 45 minutes
later and wondering what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is the old adage of,
I want to get someone as high as I
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't go by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't build drinks that are more than
five or 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of our own company motto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big guys that we work with,
the biggest alcohol brands in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have said to us, why would I possibly
want someone to have a hundred milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: drink?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to have five so I can sell
them five in an evening instead of selling
[SPEAKER_01]: them one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to see the old cannabis
religion of, you know, that get
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's high as possible, starting to
dissipate, especially when it's come to
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream and that mainstream brings the
brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you, I can't tell you who,
but I can tell you the biggest brands we
[SPEAKER_01]: work with and they are coming like a
freight train and people don't realize it
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it, all those purists that were like,
Oh, keep the Pepsi's and Cokes and
[SPEAKER_01]: anhyzers out of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming and coming strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I seem to think most people are
overlooking that consumer 55, 60 plus that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually are looking for alternatives to
the current methods that are taken for
[SPEAKER_00]: various different ailments that the people
who can tell the brands that those
[SPEAKER_00]: stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, the micro doses,
nobody wants at that age to be a feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable after consuming a product in
any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a, you know, if there's two
things that have changed and with our
[SPEAKER_01]: technology, they've really changed the
market speed to use the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I kind of alluded there with the
purple dinosaur and you were so high,
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A gummy hits 45 minutes later,
you know, and some of these companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing nano fibers, which we have nano
in our name, but that's just as part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nano 99.9% of the time is just a bunch of
BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't hold that, that nano particle
that size anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some have come up with a better,
faster way to make it work, but not
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we did university Mississippi
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a bunch of trials to see how fast
we could do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it in the bloodstream in less than
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you feel it very quickly and that's the
big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we control offset and offset?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can have a drink and make it work
really fast, I have a lower dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to change the industry in
terms of what people believe is a
[SPEAKER_01]: realistic dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: People aren't scared to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can have that dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be accurate every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a big reason why also the
industry hasn't exploded yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where it's starting to
go because now the technology will dictate
[SPEAKER_01]: that the big brands like that don't have
to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to worry that they can
build a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can build a product, or I should say
they can build a brand around the
[SPEAKER_01]: technology that will be long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about Purefuse
Polymorph fiber technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe explain a little bit,
what was the timeframe for R&D?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was written three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was that three successful years or
three roller coaster of emotion years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they're always roller
coasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some aha moments along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd even argue that it's been longer
than three years if you took all the
[SPEAKER_01]: little pieces together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gist of that technology is we went at
it completely different than everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else went at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's just probably from some
sheer luck and ignorance as to what
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody else was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think if we as a team knew what
everybody else was doing, we would try to
[SPEAKER_01]: mimic that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we went into a blind,
we went in it from a pharmaceutical side,
[SPEAKER_01]: a biotech side that said, look,
I don't think that other way works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be a better way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you had some trials, tribulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have some very immediate success,
not to the degree that we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like going to the casino and
you're one right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to stick around a little bit
longer and see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so three, four, five, six years later,
here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nanofiber is without question a
game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people that know us have used it,
have said how much different it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest issues with an emulsion,
as we talked about, which is what
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody but us uses in a beverage,
it's basically just a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took cannabis and you put it in a
sonification device.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made the particles shatter a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put a surfactant with it, put it with
water and you drop some of those drops in
[SPEAKER_01]: your beverage, mix it up and there you
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within minutes, it's stuck to the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within minutes, it started to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You degrade all of the things that go with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the entire time, it tastes
terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to hide that surfactant flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will go with some of our groups that
are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm calling competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really do what they do,
but you know, they've got better,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ours is so much different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take multiple molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fuse them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're permanently fused and now they're
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take our ingredient or powder,
stick it in a sealed bag so the oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years later, it has almost 100% the
potency it had before it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a distillate and do that,
you're going to lose 30, 40% in a matter
[SPEAKER_01]: of 30 to 45 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we suspend that animation, you might
call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can sit on that shelf and wait and
then used when it's needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we put it into water,
we get the same with a six month stability
[SPEAKER_01]: test on THC in a can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we lost about 4% in potency over six
months in a can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say the name, I know two larger
players that they have to overdose their
[SPEAKER_01]: cans before they get tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to wait three days,
then get it tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on that third or fourth day,
make sure they test it so that it all
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out with the right levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is this one company had
something go along with metric system that
[SPEAKER_01]: they had to enter it into the cannabis
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to retest it and only seven days
later, it didn't pass because it degrades
[SPEAKER_01]: that fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the consumer gets a beverage that says
it has five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they didn't buy that beverage for 30
days, the thing has like maybe two
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not fair to the consumer either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, past testing when it left the lab,
but that's the big thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what's changing the
industry too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The technology is starting to build the
brands that will get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what makes that polymorph
nanofiber so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no doubt it's going to be one
for all the viewers of this show to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: that the big brands are coming to
beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of companies like yours
and the team that you're building at Rex's
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Keith, I know you're a very busy man,
so I won't keep it too much longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we get to touch base in the
next 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a few updates from you of
where the industry is heading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody wants to know more about Rex's
biotech, you can see the website below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be in this description where you're
hearing or watching this anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for now, thank you very much and see
you next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
