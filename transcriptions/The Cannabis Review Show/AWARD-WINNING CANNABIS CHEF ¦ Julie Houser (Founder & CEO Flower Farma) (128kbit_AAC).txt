[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined by Julie
Hauser who is the founder and CEO of
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower Pharma based over in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Julie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to have you on to talk
about all the great things you are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: up to in the world of fine dining and
cuisine using cannabis-based oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little 60-second overview of how you
[SPEAKER_00]: started Flower Pharma and how you found
yourself in this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am a plant-based chef and a celebrity
chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had several years in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of my journey, I had breast
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm 11 years now cancer-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that process, I was stage three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had 18 surgeries since that
diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing amazing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many things were a part of that
journey, but cannabis was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a chef, I've always worked out my
problems in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I wanted to do is really show
people how to use cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient and build that into your diet
for wellness, all the other benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how Flower Pharma started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, as you said, teaching everybody
how to use cannabis in cuisine,
[SPEAKER_00]: we obviously, everybody kind of knows the
kind of butter that a lot of people use
[SPEAKER_00]: and the kind of simpler entry mode for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you maybe explain how you think I
imagine that the future of the industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be blends and formulations that
are created either for a clip-on for a
[SPEAKER_00]: chef to be able to have in their kitchen
and use at any given time or as part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe sold in a mass manufacturing for
consumer packaged goods?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think this is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we think back to cannabis
cooking, a lot of us still think of the
[SPEAKER_01]: brownies we made when we were in college
and everything's really green,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the kind of butter that you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we want people to start
thinking of cannabis as an ingredient,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we need to change it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make it more accessible for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the line of oils I created does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives people the opportunity to use
their own recipes, get really creative,
[SPEAKER_01]: but use these sort of finishing oils or
sauces in a way to complete the meal
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally, but without adding the
super green flavor, if you follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there seems to be a massive space
in the market that although over in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, we've got a mishmash of rules when
it comes to the novel food application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the FDA, even in America, are only now
coming to kind of draw up rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions where I think you're going to
see a hell of a lot of products are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to contain, whether it's CBD, THC,
or other cannabinoids that are found,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a combination and a blend of those
with terpenes, flavonoids, and other
[SPEAKER_00]: normal natural organic ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is actually a huge opportunity,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For people, I think we have a huge
opportunity in this industry to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant in a different way,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people, I think it's not very
natural to get together on a Friday night
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody eat a gummy at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if we can get together and commune
over a meal, and cannabis is part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, then I think we've created a new
experience and a new way for people to get
[SPEAKER_01]: together, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more than ever, the reason why I
started Tower Pharma was because I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's really a need for people to
get together and commune over food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like since the pandemic,
we've really lost that connection with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis sort of offers this
little, in whatever way, form,
[SPEAKER_01]: shape, or form you want to have it,
if it's CBD, CBG, THC, all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, they can add sort of this
element of relaxation and a point where we
[SPEAKER_01]: can just leave our politics, our religion
at the door, come together over food and
[SPEAKER_01]: just enjoy one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think when you look at the
broader market, as much as people love
[SPEAKER_00]: their smoke and their flour and all that
kind of stuff, I think the easiest entry
[SPEAKER_00]: point for the mass market and a large
consumer base is going to be food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can picture in my mind groups of
people either girls in the summer meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: for salads, and there's a sauce range on
the table that it's a much more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: experience as a group than as you said,
somebody else saying, OK, let's all eat a
[SPEAKER_00]: dougie now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's obviously going to hit
different with everybody else as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least this way, you get to choose
how much dressing you're putting on your
[SPEAKER_00]: own individual salad based on your own
needs and wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dosing is actually a whole other
topic that I'm sure we could spend a half
[SPEAKER_01]: hour on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's important because
everybody does metabolize it differently.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of part of the way we
design this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That intentionality needs to go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the more you learn in this industry,
whether it's food and consumer packaged
[SPEAKER_00]: goods or whether it's pharmaceutical grade
products, it seems to be such a nuanced
[SPEAKER_00]: either consumption method, whatever it is,
whether you're a patient or a consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: that everything so nuanced down to each
individual person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There doesn't seem to be a one size fits
all product in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry really at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the sauces and the area that
you're in at the moment is kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: crux's point in the industry where
everybody could meet in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that, right, is sort of I
think if we want to invite this new
[SPEAKER_01]: demographic that I think we all want to
include, then we do need to make it really
[SPEAKER_01]: easy, approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A way to teach people to find their dose,
find where they're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And explore the plant in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I was at an event a few months
ago and we're trying to really introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis into these events, at least here
in the United States, where we can because
[SPEAKER_01]: it feels silly to do all this business
over the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When over cocktails, when we're the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had beverages there,
cannabis beverages, and I was having a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with someone and I said,
I'm not drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, Well, I don't know how many
of those to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know how many of these to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a glass of tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have to create a space in a way
where we can find out our place with that
[SPEAKER_01]: and offer that to our new the new
demographic that we want to include.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm going to jump on to the next
topic, which is cannabis consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's something that you basically
already have experience in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just transitions perfectly into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see what's, let's say, the time
period in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, let's just pick New York,
for an example, where you'll be able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: out for a brunch or you'll be able to go
out for made up drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically going to be infused
food and infused cocktails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That don't have any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all kind of a space.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many years away realistically do you
think we are from having one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: places?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the US, of course, it varies from
state to state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of an interesting,
challenging situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, for example,
Las Vegas is probably a little bit ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: of New York in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely not the expert on lounges,
but I do know sort of the trajectory
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say that Las Vegas Las Vegas
already has a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of them have just gotten licenses
and it's probably, you know, will be
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling out in the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have some tough restrictions that
they're they're up against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, New York is just the first
dispensary just opened the doors in
[SPEAKER_01]: December and New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be a little further there with
the lounges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know the intention is sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to clarify, I think I might have got
my point mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand that Arizona and
there's other states that have already got
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption lounges going for a major
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be neighborhoods that
actually end up converting into,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, full cannabis spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have a whole block in
Manhattan is kind of just the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether states to give us an
example, but in Vegas, I would imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's going to be very touristy
central.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a regular somebody
who lives there's experience that they go
[SPEAKER_00]: for every weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say a ladies who brunch that venue
turns into a cannabis type brunch venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see that happen within a couple
of years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we understand there might be one
or two pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how long is it until we see there's
actually a whole area where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to and that's where they're
consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis via food and via drinks on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think that that really
will be able to watch that develop in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next three to five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some places I think will be in
the next year that they'll have their
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what's important is that we
watch these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that when you develop a
lounge, we need to consider it can't just
[SPEAKER_01]: be a place to go smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you need to you will always have
your people that like their flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: like to vape and want to go smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that to capture this new
audience, that there needs to be other
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how we get them to stay longer is
through their food and through their
[SPEAKER_01]: beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's music and maybe there's
other experiences that will encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: people not only to stay, but to come back
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do I think that we'll start
unrolling in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's essential to be very mindful
of the way we roll it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I've heard stories down in
Hollywood where there are first time users
[SPEAKER_01]: come to the lounges and it's just they get
too much and then they just pass out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that being, you know,
the lounges, being very mindful of having
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different ways to bring people back to
center is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I that is something that I do in my
infused dinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we're going to talk about
that more later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk about it with you if you'd
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's really important the way
we unroll the dosing right per each
[SPEAKER_01]: course, per each experience.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that like getting onto dosing
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously a huge factor when it
comes to the consumption of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific like a chef's little
trick where everybody has their own little
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise when it comes to dosage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there a per gram per body weight
type metric that people could use?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I do is in my meals,
for example, in the events that that I
[SPEAKER_01]: produce is I start out, you know,
maybe the the mocktail actually has CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which will stimulate the appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the next course we might
introduce a little bit of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, follow it up with a CBD
round at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We absolutely finished the dessert course
with CBD to sort of stabilize everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of do like to take them through.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant has so many amazing,
you know, attributes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's explore them all and, you know,
use them the way they're intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think if we have those
things on board, then we'll get people
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't agree with you more once that
dosage gets done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you repeat customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go, we've got a couple of
minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move on to your range of oils
called OLA, which obviously translate in
[SPEAKER_00]: Irish to oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about the reasoning behind the
naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any relatives back in Ireland
that you know of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I am 50 percent Irish.
[SPEAKER_01]: My father, my maiden name is Mulcahy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know there's some of us running
around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: My great grandparents are right from
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was playing when I was creating
this, I had, I don't know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: product creation is a whole wild game in
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I played around with a lot of words
and I just wanted OLA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is oil in Gaelic, but it also
means high in Spanish and it means all
[SPEAKER_01]: these lovely things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I think it's it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to stay very close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that has a lovely way of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of other lines at my
sleeve for this year that we might play
[SPEAKER_01]: with some other Gaelic names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just tease you with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to tell you very much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so more to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's sort of where OLA came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope to get to try these oils now
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope to see them on shelves over in
Ireland over the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody else can see the amazing
creations that you're concocting up in
[SPEAKER_00]: your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time is just about up now,
Jules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we could definitely have a
second episode and go to a host more other
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, thank you very much for
taking your time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look forward to seeing you again and
definitely getting OLA on the shelves over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% will help you with that not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
