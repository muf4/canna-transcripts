[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Chris Davis, who's the executive
[SPEAKER_00]: director of INCBA, which is the
International Cannabis Bar Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking the time to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick little overview in under 60 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: of how you ended up as the executive
director of the INCBA?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came on, it was 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the association was started in 2015 by
a group of lawyers in San Francisco that
[SPEAKER_01]: really looked around and saw the need for
increased levels of legal services in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started volunteering with INCBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a completely different industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was in securities litigation and then
I was in finance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really sort of liked the industry,
had historical connections to it through
[SPEAKER_01]: family and friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I moved back to California in
about 2016, I started doing pro bono work
[SPEAKER_01]: for a few family and friends, you know,
really sort of got up to speed with where
[SPEAKER_01]: the law was at the time and sort of what
we needed going into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then was lucky enough to apply for the
position and be hired as executive
[SPEAKER_01]: director.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the origins of the agency go back to
what year and what stage is for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's not aware?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I said, it was it was San
Francisco, so California in about 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization happened in California back
in 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was legal for quite a while,
but it was under a not for profit model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had collectives and cooperatives
that would provide medicine to patients
[SPEAKER_01]: that needed cannabis in order to treat
either for palliative care or for other
[SPEAKER_01]: pain management issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked around and really the group of
women that started the association saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: need for lawyers to get together and to
speak to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really wasn't a set of best
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an industry that that had not
really from the legal side had not really
[SPEAKER_01]: matured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it was illegal at the federal level,
it was legal at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of discomfort with
papering any sort of arrangements among
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was really sort of everyone was
allergic to putting anything down on
[SPEAKER_01]: paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were still afraid that that federal the
federal government was going to come in,
[SPEAKER_01]: bring seizure actions against individual
companies, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to create those best
practices, three women in San Francisco
[SPEAKER_01]: got together and they really said,
you know, it would benefit not only us and
[SPEAKER_01]: not only our clients to have everyone sort
of be on the same page about how we should
[SPEAKER_01]: do some of these things, but it would
benefit us to have the people across the
[SPEAKER_01]: table from us, you know, start from a
place of education, start from a place
[SPEAKER_01]: where they knew sort of what the what the
rules are and what they should be and how
[SPEAKER_01]: we should proceed as an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it started off as a networking group
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, we got into continuing legal
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we put on about 80 hours of
continuing legal education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each year we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year we have five in-person events
lined up, one in Europe, which would make
[SPEAKER_01]: six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited for that one
coming up in Ireland on the 25th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we've really expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We touch on pretty much all facets of the
cannabis industry now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything from, you know, educating
lawyers on how to best serve their clients
[SPEAKER_01]: to advocacy, to liaison, liaisoning with
the government, sort of all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: facets are things that are covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under our banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was the first step in towards
creating an international association?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there one specific country from
outside the states that got together?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell us on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew up organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there had always been sort of an
eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this this idea from our beginning
that we wanted to fill a space that wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: currently filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of international
transactions, it really didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understood that legalization was sort
of rolling across across the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a lot of lessons to be
learned from how we're doing things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States, what we're doing right,
what we're doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of our first international
members, someone that came to one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis law institutes in Washington,
D.C., was a gentleman from Lesotho.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that really opened our eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was sort of traveling across the
globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a few European members at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we had members from from
France, from Germany, from Spain and from
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we sort of saw the writing on the
wall that there was going to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: utility from the international
perspective, both from from those
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals trying to push a regulated
market on on a domestic level from
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever they were from, but then also
sort of laying the groundwork for
[SPEAKER_01]: international transactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really it was an organic evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited that now we have our
INCBA Europe group over the next year or
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do plan on rolling out those other sort
of large geographical portions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So INCBA, Latin America, INCBA,
Africa, those sort of like collaborations
[SPEAKER_01]: of clients in those jurisdictions as they
come online and as they create regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next topic and conversation I wanted
to have was basically as a compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: professional and a business strategist for
people over in Europe who are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: try and write policy and have policy
influence, what states would you be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of that have the best legal framework in
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there a combination of a multitude
of states where you could Frankenstein a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of different policy and create a
perfect policy for Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably the latter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say that any jurisdiction in
the United States has gotten it exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really depends on what stage of the
market you're looking at as we look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: success of individual jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a place like California, which is
where I sit, as the market's matured,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really we've run into difficulty
because we've really overtaxed some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've made it very, very difficult for the
legal regulated market, which has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits related to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can trace transactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have financial tracking of a lot of the
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the ability to test product to
make sure that public health and safety is
[SPEAKER_01]: ensured as we roll out these products and
these programs to a wider group of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in California, we've really
created a system where the illicit market
[SPEAKER_01]: is really able to compete with the legal
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so although we've done some things
right, there are some things that we got
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of wrong in that capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is about matching your policy
goals to the drafting that you put down on
[SPEAKER_01]: paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever we create a complex regulatory
system, and for most jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is coming out of nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really unique situation in which
we're not evolving a regulatory structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming up with one from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those always have unintended
consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a place like New York has a really
robust social equity program that stems
[SPEAKER_01]: from those regulators having a specific
set of policy objectives in mind and then
[SPEAKER_01]: working backwards through the regulations
and understanding how to draft a set of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations that promote those specific
policy objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really difficult thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really what you have to do as a
jurisdiction is you have to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what you want your ultimate market to look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, we don't have the same concerns
that we do in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: using social equity as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not this history of animus
towards certain sets of individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the drug war has not been used to
really wage a war on certain individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: that we now need to include in the market
going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't have that policy goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you write a set of regulations sort of
on a fundamentally different basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, it's about working backward
from the market that you want to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: an efficient market that has
predictability and transactions,
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer protection, the ability to track
and trace some of the products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going through to make sure that they're
not being diverted either out of state in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States or out of the country in
Europe, and really working back from that
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that you're having a cohesive
regulatory structure that you can overlay
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of an existing market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the other unique thing
about the cannabis industry is not only do
[SPEAKER_01]: we not have regulations, and so we're
creating this regulatory structure from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch, but there's an existing set of
demand for the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in virtually every jurisdiction in
which we see legalization occur,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not because people want to create
access where there was no access before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because we want to formalize the
access.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to ensure that there's product
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to ensure that tax revenue accrues
to the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, you're trying to place a
regulatory regime on top of an existing
[SPEAKER_01]: market that to this point has been
unregulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, it's a piecemeal sort of
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: For European regulators that are trying to
create these regulatory structures,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really about going through and
understanding what each specific
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature and regulator wanted to see
from the end product in each one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the purported focus of the
regulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it to increase your tax revenue
through increasing the tax revenue base?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to do that through specific
taxes on cannabis-related entities?
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to have a cultivation tax?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want to ensure that each one of
these companies that has been created is
[SPEAKER_01]: paying an income tax that's more aligned
with traditional taxation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the problems, again,
here in California that we've seen is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have all these different stages of
taxation, but that takes away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall tax base for a company paying into
the income tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so income tax is reduced because we
made competition more difficult because we
[SPEAKER_01]: had things like the cultivation tax,
which was recently repealed for exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: those reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think a standardized testing system
for the United States when federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization comes is going to be easy to
implement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you still think it will always be on
a state-by-state basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And surely if it's going to be interstate
commerce, there needs to be an overarching
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of rules that everybody has to
apply by?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA is never going to give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Food and Drug Administration,
the dual federalism problem is always
[SPEAKER_01]: going to arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Food and Drug Administration,
its primary directive is to ensure health
[SPEAKER_01]: and safety of products that are consumable
products for individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only consumables, but also cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're never going to let go of that
jurisdictional purview.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to need some sort of
national mechanism whereby we can see if
[SPEAKER_01]: products are safe for consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, what we've seen in the
auto industry in the United States is we
[SPEAKER_01]: have state-by-state regulation,
but we have production plans that
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily take place in certain
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we may have all of our cars that
are made in Detroit, but California has
[SPEAKER_01]: the most stringent emissions standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is those Detroit
producers, they have to adhere to the
[SPEAKER_01]: California emissions standards because
those are the strictest in the country and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the largest market in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really what I think naturally
before the FDA sort of establishes any of
[SPEAKER_01]: those boundaries, I think that probably we
will tend towards whatever one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: largest consumer state has implemented for
their testing policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ultimately it's going to be a race
to the top as opposed to a race to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that we're going to see sort
of a relaxation of those health and safety
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're going to sort of pick
the state that has the most stringent
[SPEAKER_01]: standards, which at this point is sort of
a, there's a competition, but California
[SPEAKER_01]: has very, very stringent standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that we're going to see
sort of everyone coalesce around what
[SPEAKER_01]: those standards are in order to be able to
have a national market for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to be able to be eligible to ship
your product out of a producing state and
[SPEAKER_01]: to access markets like California or New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need to sort of rise to the
level of whatever testing they establish
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question before I let you go,
which do you think is going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Safe Banking Act is going to be passed or
a European country is going to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational market?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given the dysfunction in our Congress,
I think that a European country is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to establish that adult use market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that a couple are on the cusp right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that the laws in Germany are
changing very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to seeing what happens in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the only way that the Safe
Banking Act potentially beats the
[SPEAKER_01]: implementation of an adult use market in
Europe is if it gets sort of snuck into
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the larger bills that we have
passing, but our House of Representatives
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have much of an appetite to pass
anything at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that that's probably a safe
bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's keeping an eye on Germany or
Prague or Czech Republic, which one is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get out of the guns first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully for the rest of Europe and
the global industry, that one of them gets
[SPEAKER_00]: assorted by the end of 23, start of 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing talking to you,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man,
so I'll let you go.

industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, thank you very much again for
taking the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
