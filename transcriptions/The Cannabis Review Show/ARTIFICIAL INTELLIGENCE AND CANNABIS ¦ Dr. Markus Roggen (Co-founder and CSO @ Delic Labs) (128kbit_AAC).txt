[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Dr Marcus Roggen, who's the president
[SPEAKER_01]: and CEO of Delic Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you keep it today, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSO, CEO, I gave up that job to a more
business minded person so I can focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to give everybody a quick
little overview of how you ended up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry at Delic Labs?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is a quick 15 minute talk,
so that won't be the full story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in short, I have a PhD in chemistry
and then serendipitously while I was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: my postdoc in California, I got into the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was recreational legal in Colorado at
the time and medically legal in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my chemistry skills brought me into
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it exactly that you guys
specialize at your laboratory?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in Vancouver, Canada,
so that we can get research licenses from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian government on cannabis and
psychedelic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we partner with the University of
British Columbia to do fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: research in both the field of analytics
and process chemistry of cannabis to help
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and end consumers make better
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and do you see, I've been reading up
and researching a lot about creating your
[SPEAKER_01]: own cell line to use precision
fermentation to create both psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and cannabinoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that as being the future of
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say the ingredient side of this of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, I will always talk down on
a plant scientist and say, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, it's the post-processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, grow environment, grow
conditions, fertilizers can influence the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical profiles the plants express.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone talks about the strains or the
cultivars of cannabis, but the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is actually more influential
than the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because what what people care about is
the chemical profile, so the chemo of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I prefer to influence that in
post-production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we harvest the plant, how do we
dry the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we cure it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how do we extract it and then package
it into the various products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there currently is done so much in
extracting that there's very little left
[SPEAKER_00]: over from the original chemo bar
fingerprint of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my research or our research
is on to optimizing these extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: processes to better express the chemical
profile of those plants in the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: process and therefore in the final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the extraction process is basically
manipulating the end product to be as
[SPEAKER_01]: purified and exact as you want and
whatever about the initial flowering was
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get to change and alter it so
much that it's as clean as the
[SPEAKER_01]: biotechnology method, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it in its basic
form, the cannabis plant produces THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: THC acid and people care about THC because
that makes them high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get it out of the plant and
how do you put it in a in a vape cartridge
[SPEAKER_00]: or a final product?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only think about a single compound,
then it's relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extraction and the purification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think that cannabis is
designed as a recreational product because
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the flavors and the higher feelings
one gets from them, pure THC doesn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the interplay of various
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have to track multiple compounds
and they all behave slightly different in
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and purification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets a very complicated
multifactorial optimization problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there can be experience, there can be
chemometrics to do this work, but it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: like a single dial at a time new
experiment process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then quickly shifted in our company
to use machine learning because these
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithms can track way more variables at
a time and optimize for all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we work with cannabis producers to
take in all their data, run it through our
[SPEAKER_00]: machine learning process, and then with
Bayesian optimization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to look that up on
Wikipedia, we then narrowed down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: best method and we can then optimize for
yield, cost, purity or flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually wanted to move on to AI and
cannabis next.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great transition there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question for an AI and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is computer vision ever going to be
something that will be utilized to,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, monitor the health of a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Better that the human eye could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is machine learning capable of
recommending, well, as far as deep
[SPEAKER_01]: learning, if you're recommending blends
and formulations of different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpenoids and flavonoids that may
become future ingredients or products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, all of that is already
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our niche of AI and machine
learning in extraction and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics, finding new compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using like language AI to
interpret mass fragmentation patterns to
[SPEAKER_00]: find new cannabinoids and then track them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really fun and cool for like the
geeky chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for your question on computer vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually worked with two startup
companies that use computer vision to
[SPEAKER_00]: track the health of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had cameras in the ceilings of
grow rooms and would then monitor the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and could spot the pests or
diseases earlier so that a cultivator
[SPEAKER_00]: could then selectively treat that one
plant or remove that diseased leaf before
[SPEAKER_00]: it spread through the whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, there's a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first company was Deep Green AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they're still around,
but they probably folded their technology
[SPEAKER_00]: in some other application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But computer vision can also be used in
other aspects, for example, trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis plant is harvested and the
flower buds are then manicured with
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors to have this nice shape and
appearance for the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's quite labor-intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a friend, John Goa, had this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, now I'm missing the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will figure it out in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his company built robots that manicured
cannabis flower buds into these nice end
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, they needed to look at the
flower from all angles, understand what is
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, what is leaf, what needs to be
trimmed, where does it need to be cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were training the AI,
the computer vision, of interpreting what
[SPEAKER_00]: this robot is looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his company, he then sold it on to
a larger conglomerate in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is cryogenically frozen cannabis the best
way to treat cannabis once it's fresh and
[SPEAKER_01]: grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what you want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so for me, let's say we want to make
flower as the end product, we want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: vape cartridge as the end product,
and we want to use it as an edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it suitable for all three of those,
or is it perfect for just one of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cryogenically frozen basically just
means freezing it very, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have seen the bad Batman movie
with Mr. Freeze, that's cryogenically
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it basically just arrests the plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still wet, it's still fresh,
it's just frozen in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you now want to use ice water hash
or kefing, so to separate the trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: heads that are rich or that produce all
the cannabinoids from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, then that is quite good because
it's fresh, it's brittle, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily remove them by agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't smoke it because it's still
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just frozen, but it's still wet,
so you can't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do cryogenic drying, so freeze
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you freeze the material, cryogenically
freeze the material, and then you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through freeze dry cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are potentially really
beneficial to remove the water and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: more terpenes on the flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would potentially give you a more
flavorful, smokable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some companies in the space
that are working on these aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linder, for example, a gas supplier,
they have some technologies in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, is it useful for
extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all, because extraction doesn't
really want to deal with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the cannabis plant frozen,
but it's still full of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a CO2 extraction that's done at
buff room temperature, it would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: thaw anyway, and all the water just really
throws the extraction out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the cannabis compound database?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you guys set it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is it so important for the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got into the cannabis industry in
like 2014, there were like four
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids known that people tested for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get basic standards for those
and that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the academic literature,
you already knew about like 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, it extended to like
150 different cannabinoids that are known.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nowadays you can only buy 16 reference
standards and testing labs only test for
[SPEAKER_00]: like 10 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, there's a big difference
between like what information you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: on a piece of paper from the producer or
from the testing lab and what actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's research by Professor Dr.
Mary out of Israel that really shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's beyond these 10 cannabinoids that
actually have biological effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did some anti-cannabis screens where
he found some really minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't even have names yet that kill
the tumor, but THC isn't really doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was always intrigued what
actually is in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I want to do good extraction or
get the right product for the right
[SPEAKER_00]: medical need, I need to understand what is
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just make a product where 80% of
the ingredient is unknown to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore we just started scouring the
academic literature and doing our own
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments to then figure out what
different compounds are in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, hence cannabis compound database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just like hand curated that at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we have better analytical
tools in our lab with our language AI to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out new cannabinoids, we then start
adding them as well to our database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that this database can then
use by other people to look at their
[SPEAKER_00]: material or their spectra or their
analytical runs and compare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe we can help them through
that database figure out what they have in
[SPEAKER_00]: their material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the basic idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems how do you get useful for
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we get to chat again in the near
future for anybody who wants to learn more
[SPEAKER_01]: about Delic Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the website below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be in all of the links and all the
platforms that you're watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again for taking the time,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
