[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Arno Valdovinos, who's the Principal
[SPEAKER_00]: Consultant at Canon Monitor based in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Arno?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of how you came into the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and your current position at Canon
Monitor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so I've been involved in the
cannabis space since I was quite young,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe too young even.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a professional sense, it all came
about six years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started working for a British
consultancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it as an opportunity to merge my
skills in market research and consultancy
[SPEAKER_01]: with one of my passions, which was the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about three years ago, I started my
own practice, which is Canon Monitor,
[SPEAKER_01]: working mostly with European clients on
market intelligence and research on the
[SPEAKER_01]: European markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start off with the Canon
Monitor report that you guys have been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of this report, the sectors that it
[SPEAKER_00]: covers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just Spain specific and why this
would be valuable?
[SPEAKER_00]: To a lot of the European operators?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is a report that is focused on
Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not cover any other markets,
even though, of course, they have some
[SPEAKER_01]: relevance also for the Spanish market
because there are some operators that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in both cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, the goal was to provide a
comprehensive view on the situation in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain because now the spanna business is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's asking questions like,
what happens with the clubs?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens with the what are the CBD
stores that I see on the street,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody knew exactly how the market is
set up and what are the different segments
[SPEAKER_01]: and the operators and how it all works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, we cover pretty
comprehensively all the segments of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry by doing a market sizing in terms
of how many employees there are,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are the revenues generated,
what have been the investments in each
[SPEAKER_01]: segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this covers particularly medical
cannabis because it's now going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized finally in the country,
but also CBD and also the home growing
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and also the illicit market,
which is very prevalent and growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's start with the Spain and the
medical cannabis industry over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain has always kind of been one of the
four front leaders in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's known about the social clubs
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty surprising that if you
actually have been checking on this
[SPEAKER_00]: territory, that there is no medical
cannabis program at all over in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this new minister of health that's
been brought in after your general
[SPEAKER_00]: elections seems to be very pro medical
cannabis and bringing this industry to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
breakdown of is flower included?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it regular pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it specialized doctors?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the proposed conditions that
they're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they looking to bring in for this
medical market in Spain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we are speaking, we do not have the
final version of the royal decree that
[SPEAKER_01]: will legalize medical cannabis in the
country, sadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we know what the ministry has
said, which is in application of the
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusions of a parliamentary commission
that happened in 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some idea of how it may play
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For now, there are no mentions that the
flower are going to be included.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like the regulator will choose
pharmaceutical forms in the form of
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not clear yet which of them probably
oils, but maybe a different one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the list of the pharmaceutical forms
could potentially be expanded in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future, which is also important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also how it is worded in the sense of how
easy it is to get new formats in the
[SPEAKER_01]: scheme is going to be massively important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other factors are, of course, the number
of who can prescribe, which it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be just specialists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing is who can dispense
these products, which it looks like it
[SPEAKER_01]: might be only in the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, we do not know how the
wording of this decree is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, how easy it will be to expand
this dispensation also to community
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously, if you look at the map
of Spain, it's quite big for the
[SPEAKER_01]: population it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many patients are going to be far away
from the hospitals where they need to get
[SPEAKER_01]: their medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it probably makes sense to allow
community pharmacies to dispense as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be taking a conservative
approach initially for the first stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: this medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you said, on a territory basis,
the cost and the traveling time frame for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who may be sick, hospital
pharmacies is a pretty reserved strategy
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine that the Pharmacy Union of
Spain are lobbying hard to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that their members are able to
dispense and sell these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the advantages of the new
regulation, which, as you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that pretty much every country
when they first regulate medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to be pretty conservative,
as you are very well aware in Ireland,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also in other markets in Europe,
has had the same situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one advantage that all the
colleges of doctors and pharmacies are on
[SPEAKER_01]: board with the new regulation is that
we're necessarily 100% on board with
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, as we're seeing now,
for instance, in Germany with recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite conservative, but we
certainly hope for it to get expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time and sooner rather than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the specialist doctors
that are allowed to prescribe,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this somebody who's a certified pain
specialist or a certified oncology expert?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would imagine that if
telemedicine has got to be a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the program in Spain due to, as you said,
the location of patients away from major
[SPEAKER_00]: cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the prescriptions being written
by a condensed small amount of specialist
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, do you think there'll be any
international expertise that are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take part in the industry, or would it be
closed to just Spanish specialists?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sadly, we do not know yet the specific
list of specialists that are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, by looking at the indications
that the regulator wants to include,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are mostly pain and particularly
chronic pain, which is also an important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to the fact that all chronic pain
patients are at least in theory going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to be prescribed medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would assume that pain specialists are
going to be able to prescribe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we do not know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the regulator is very
worried about possible diversion to the
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit market, which is, I mean,
it's probably more based on their fears
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than an actual reality on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like at the beginning,
they want to make sure that this is not
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like telemedicine and even
something that is very normal in Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: or the UK, like shipping the products from
the pharmacy to the patient by the mail,
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like this is not going to be
possible in the early stages of the new
[SPEAKER_01]: program, as it is not allowed for other
medicines in Spain generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also could be a positive thing that
doesn't allow one large company to control
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry by being able to deliver
these medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that there's going to have to be
localised clinics for each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think being that the market is going to
be a magistral sector, so the pharmacist
[SPEAKER_01]: will need to prepare each prescription
according to the indications of the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor, as it is in Germany, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany, we see that there are a
relatively small number of pharmacies that
[SPEAKER_01]: serve the population through the post,
and they can offer better prices and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: better service and a wider assortment of
products than other pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that allowing this type of
things wouldn't be bad at all for the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that giving freedom to prescribe
and freedom to get as many products of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest quality possible is always the
goal of a medical cannabis scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, there's no country in the
world yet that's just opened up the gates
[SPEAKER_00]: for a medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been step by step and
incremental gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the next topic, which a lot
of people have always been posting about
[SPEAKER_00]: is the social clubs in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little bit detached over here in
Ireland and other parts of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of get headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last big headline was one of the
mayors in Barcelona was looking to close
[SPEAKER_00]: down the social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this still the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, are the social clubs so
ingrained in society that it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: possible now to remove them?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, the landscape of social
clubs in Spain is highly localized,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, in Madrid, clubs have been
closed for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had some problems with the police,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one might say that Barcelona was
probably the hotbed of these clubs and
[SPEAKER_01]: because apart from other areas,
but Barcelona in particular, thanks to
[SPEAKER_01]: some regulations developed by the
municipal council.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're seeing now after the courts
repealed these municipal regulations in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past due to in constitutionality,
we are seeing a shift in the position of
[SPEAKER_01]: the municipal council that is very,
very worrisome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, and the situation is still
quite uncertain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a part of simply populist
tactics because there's an ongoing
[SPEAKER_01]: security situation in the city that the
council might want to look like they are
[SPEAKER_01]: acting upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though, of course, the clubs are
quite the harm reduction initiative that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually gets people out from the streets,
from street dealing and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the situation could very well
deteriorate if the clubs were to be
[SPEAKER_01]: curtailed in their activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For now, there has been a ramp up in
inspections of these clubs, but it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: certain at all what's gonna happen in the
next few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like at least next week with the
Spanabes, they are still gonna be open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, as far as I remember in
the last few years, there has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns with the clubs regarding their
likely legal status in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this seems likely to remain for the
time being because they are, as you are
[SPEAKER_01]: well aware, they are not legal in the
sense that they are written into
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation, but rather a loophole in the
gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a lighter note now, you have Spanabes
next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reckon you'll be a pretty busy man with
everybody trying to pull at you from all
[SPEAKER_00]: angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking forward to Spanabes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you got a number of events lined up
that you plan on attending?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting better year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer only Spanabes, but there's
a plethora of parallel events,
[SPEAKER_01]: some that are more focused on the,
let's say, cannabis cups and contests,
[SPEAKER_01]: others that are more professional
networking events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm gonna be attending the
Cannabis Hub, which is a local entity in
[SPEAKER_01]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are doing an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be attending the Cannabis
Genomics Conference, which is a new event
[SPEAKER_01]: created this year based on genetics,
just something very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be at ICBC, which is of course B2B
networking event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be of course also at Spanabes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking forward to catching up with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice having everybody come to
your city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do not need to move for the
networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody comes to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having something like Spanabes
and the other satellite events around you
[SPEAKER_00]: is nothing but good business for kind of
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who's watching this,
who's not reached out to our know yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're remotely thinking about entering
into the Spanish market or need up to date
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory and legal information,
kind of monitor the main place to be
[SPEAKER_00]: checking out when you go into the Spanish
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arno, I might get you to make an
introduction to the Cannabis Cup founders,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think that's something that the
viewers would love to hear an interview
[SPEAKER_00]: from the people who manage the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Cup founders, the contest,
you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's speak offline about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just coming up to the 15 minutes
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, anybody who's going into the
Spanish market that hasn't dealt with Arno
[SPEAKER_00]: or kind of monitor yet, I highly recommend
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their website is going to be below in
wherever you're watching or listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, Arno, thank you very much for
your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might even touch base in a couple of
weeks and you can give us a rundown of how
[SPEAKER_00]: good the Spanabes week was and why
everybody in the global industry should be
[SPEAKER_00]: attending that every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an absolute pleasure,
Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you have a great day and great
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same to you, Arno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
