[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Heidi Whitman.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the Global Strategy Director for
Aveda Global.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heidi, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for being on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you who don't know Heidi,
she's got an esteemed career so far in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and has now moved on to one of
the top companies in the global sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Heidi, do you want to give everybody a
little overview of how you got to where
you are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready to beat at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2017, my husband and I started
researching going into natural health,
[SPEAKER_00]: holistic means, medicines, and fell into
the CBD world while visiting America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am American, but I do live here in the
UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent seven months doing due
diligence in the States, looking to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what was working, what wasn't,
understanding the market as best as we
[SPEAKER_00]: could with the mindset to bring something
back to the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our desire was to provide a product
for people and for pets because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: part of my background, technically,
was in veterinary medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created a brand called The Naked
Leaf, brought it back to the UK and
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully started trading for people
over here, as well as for pets and people
[SPEAKER_00]: in America, back in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our product and our brand and our
company was acquired by a different group
[SPEAKER_00]: that was looking for a vertical operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent our time doing all of that
type of transitional work, which led me
[SPEAKER_00]: into a group of wonderful experiential
education in the marketplace, in the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: realm, and also started getting my passion
for medical marijuana, which was the next
[SPEAKER_00]: phase that I wanted to enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I met the group at Evita
Global, who are producing the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something I really was
excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we melded forces and joined together
just this past June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are on mute, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still muted there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of have the expertise from the
veterinary side coming in to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not somebody just come in and set up
a CBD company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me what attracted you to
Evita Global?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their story like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give maybe the viewer an overview
of who Evita Global are and what their
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, partially because I have been a
medical cannabis patient myself in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, it is really important to understand
where your product comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is something that the
consumer and the patients don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of access to knowing because there's so
much out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I liked about Evita Global was
the transparency and their traceability to
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really unique about Evita is
this is a group that had an idea to create
[SPEAKER_00]: this high medical, high quality medical
cannabis with three factors in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: the location, the people and the process
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they have done uniquely is
they've set up an area in Colombia,
[SPEAKER_00]: an area called La Jolla de Iberico in
Cesar, which is northeast Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the foot of the Andes Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at doing a sustainable,
natural growing method by being
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally sound and carbon neutral
along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a three year process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've joined in at a very critical time
where everything is now moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was nice about this is that being
that cannabis plants are like a sponge,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the environment is grows into
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grow hydroponically and purposeful
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's akin to laboratory conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that to be really unique being
that it's outdoors, hydroponically grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: but covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the optimum 13 hours of daylight,
consistent temperatures of 26 to 34
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, they can actually harvest about
five to six crops a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's a limitation for patient
access due to supply, this to me was
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly interesting because now we can
produce a medicinal cannabis that can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually reach those who need it because
of our ability to harvest in these
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although they have these six harvests
per year, they micro harvest every three
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watching these controlled batches,
making sure that the epigenetics are being
[SPEAKER_00]: taken in consideration, that all the data
that's being collected is shared with our
[SPEAKER_00]: bio diligence team in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything they're doing has such concise
and precise measures that the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency will then follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has it's proven to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think all of the efforts that
they have made so far has been have been
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievably exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in a EU GMP track and that should
be coming in at the end of this quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will give us the ability to focus
on all of the markets, including not only
[SPEAKER_00]: just Columbia, but also the neighboring
South American countries like Brazil,
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, and of course,
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is part of why I was fascinated
with their process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other part is the locals impact
that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they harness almost all of the
local skill sets that they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they work really carefully with the
Ministry of Justice for security on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also work with the the National
Training Service, which is called Sena
[SPEAKER_00]: down in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have 60 employees and recent
grads that work on the agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal side link joined joining a Vida
and 60 of them are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we hope to actually employ about 600
people when it's all the 40 hectares are
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with our our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the fact that they also have
three quarters of their employees are
[SPEAKER_00]: female because they're trying to keep this
ratio to give opportunities to the local
[SPEAKER_00]: women who are usually disadvantaged in
terms of employment opportunities in the
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt that was something that was
really close to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of ethics behind this
company, as well as the the careful
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics being followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with a group of people that are
involved, we have the top agronomists,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best cultivators, a lot of
people that used to work in pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the skill sets are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we do have a bio
diligence team in Israel that monitors all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the genetics, all of the data and keeps
us on track to making sure that we're ever
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving and that whatever strains we are
growing can complement the necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: medical conditions that could benefit from
these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other little point,
if I don't if you don't mind me saying is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they also have a foundation where
coming from a background where I worked in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of nonprofit as a volunteer,
Aveda Global set up a foundation to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: back some to give back to the local
country with a focus on education,
[SPEAKER_00]: local enterprise, environment and arts and
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been working well past this
past year a lot with the pandemic and
[SPEAKER_00]: assisting those in the area that were
suffering from food shortages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And job shortages, of course, but they
also are looking to promote transportation
[SPEAKER_00]: options for the local children who tend to
walk five K to work every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to school every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found that to be a really nice
component of what Aveda does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically the guys have got the
model in place where the price per gram
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in Colombia is going to be a
specific attractive part of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the medical research side of
Israel, which are the world leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the other attractive side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the components for that company seem to
be put in position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final piece for me is always
equity partners who stands to make from
[SPEAKER_01]: the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the company is in a territory,
are they giving back to the people in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you seem to be doing all three of the
right things for a company to do to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what you're going to see over
time now is the acquisitions and mergers
[SPEAKER_01]: of a lot of companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be left with,
let's say, the top five to 10 companies
[SPEAKER_01]: who, if they haven't got that price point
per gram, they're going to be blown out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they haven't got the medical research
and the top tier research that goes along
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, which brings me on to my next
topic, which is fostering relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: with universities for research and
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys seem to be pretty good at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something that you'd give any
information to the audience on this side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of our chief medical officer
happens to be Dr. Francisco Cabal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the leading Colombian
trauma doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's doing right now in Colombia,
he has started a three phase clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and he's working on four aspects,
which is trauma, post-traumatic stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, combined cancer, as well as
multiple sclerosis, which is very close to
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of our hearts because we've had
several different family members suffering
[SPEAKER_00]: from it, as well as Dr. Cabal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that trial is underway that is based
out of his eye care clinics, which are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives us patient access,
doctor access, and he can keep his finger
[SPEAKER_00]: on the pulse of all of the processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this began the beginning of
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a three phase, three year trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have fostered very close
relationships with universities and
[SPEAKER_00]: academies locally in Colombia,
but also in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we have a form of a
bio-diligence group over there that is
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping an eye on everything we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been advising from the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also are looking at all the
genetic aspects and pharmaceutical aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of each strain that we are working with,
making sure that we have the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery systems, also creating new
delivery systems that are unique to the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace, which will be released once
we finalize everything with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Multidisciplinary Center at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Techion are two of those locations that
we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also understanding the new cannabis
molecules and how the combination of these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules and the entourage effect can
work with different medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these all keep us up to date with the
latest developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working hard to make sure that
we've got as much clinical background on
[SPEAKER_00]: our strains to be able to provide to
prescribers, to give them the confidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: the assurance that everything we're doing
is copacetic with what they are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe for their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last topic that I want to touch on,
and it's something I know you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be an expert on, and I've had a good few
people kind of ask me about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard of a lot of companies doing
CBD for different pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about CBD for horses,
the benefits that it does or does not
[SPEAKER_01]: bring, and how it should be administered,
and maybe what the recommended dosage for
[SPEAKER_01]: a horse would be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know there's a good few
interested people who want to show or hear
[SPEAKER_01]: this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot to say on this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that's close to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an equestrian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with horses has been something
that's been not only a passion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but creating a hemp-based product for
horses was something that I wanted to set
[SPEAKER_00]: out to do, and I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was with the Naked Leaf Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, in the UK, CBD for pets and
animals in general is not permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, and I'm disclosing all of this
information not being a veterinarian,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you some information on how I
have seen it work well in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, and what I hope to
see is the acceptance leading across
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other countries are starting to look at it
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's becoming a hot topic,
and there is a lot of owner of horses,
[SPEAKER_00]: equestrian demand for their equine
partners to have an ability to recover
[SPEAKER_00]: while in motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what CBD does for horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like us, they are mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you give a horse CBD, they are all
sensitive creatures as large as they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always deem them like butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you give anything to a horse,
it can affect them quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD is no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's different types of
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give some examples just of my own
product that we created.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pellet form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an ingestible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each pellet had a 1% content of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, a scoops that we had,
which was equivalent to about a
[SPEAKER_00]: tablespoon, was about 75 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was for an average size horse,
500 kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: 550 kilos, it was about a 300 milligram
dose that seemed to work best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also dealing with a very long gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're dealing with anything
ingestible, you've got to remember a horse
[SPEAKER_00]: is built a little differently than a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have had amazing anecdotal real world
evidence showing that with this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage or 300 milligrams of CBD product
for a 500, 550 kilo horse, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in anxiety, a reduction in
arthritic range of motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was increased, the arthritis pain
subsided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when pain subsides, a horse will eat
better like any of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in pain, you don't want to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a horse doesn't eat, they can also
result, have GI issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very important that if you have
an animal, you want to treat them like a
[SPEAKER_00]: horse with something to reduce their pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help them create their regular
system functions, as well as eating and
[SPEAKER_00]: defecating, et cetera, which is really
important in the horse world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also had great success with topical
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is a horse with swelling in
the leg, there's no need for that edema to
[SPEAKER_00]: go down the leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a way to actually reduce that
swelling with a CBD topical solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally loved our liniment gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that was something we
created and it worked a long time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that water soluble nanomolecular CBD
liniment gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's helped horses, like I said,
with my own experience as well as our
[SPEAKER_00]: customers in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if it's in every question and
answer tool box, you don't have to aim for
[SPEAKER_00]: those bute type drugs, drugs that can
actually on a long-term basis affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: animal's wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect of CBD for horses,
it is not permitted in competition
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a withdrawal period for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure if you're going to be using CBD
for horses that whatever product you're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying has that withdrawal period noted on
the product or contact the company itself
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you are not competing unknowingly
having cannabinoids in your horse's body
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you get disqualified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that- Can I just ask a question there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD is illegal for any racehorse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they're racing, yes, that is
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe the only horses that are
allowed to take CBD, and I could be wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: here, are polo horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, racing,
FEI, Youssef, show jumping, and the racing
[SPEAKER_00]: associations do not permit cannabinoids in
horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if there is a withdrawal period,
using them while not racing and monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: them is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would want to make sure that you
know exactly what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cross-contamination within your
yard and that your horses are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need almost a groom-proof system so
that in these sensitive tests that they
[SPEAKER_00]: provide these horses at times,
you can make sure that there's nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: touching CBD and then touching another
horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these animals have been
training for so long, you wouldn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: someone to be disqualified accidentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe, though, these are the
athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we prevent athletes from not
getting the chance to recover naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: while in motion when we personally,
as athletes, get to recover while we're in
[SPEAKER_00]: motion?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anything, they're then put in a box
and told to stand still, which isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: always very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that it should be necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: about this to the heads of the Olympic
committees, as well as Youssef and FEI.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was back in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, they were skeptical but
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they agreed with me that it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of rewriting rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it takes a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, therefore, it's a matter of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are passionate, those equestrians,
the trainers to push the veterinary
[SPEAKER_00]: medical directorate to maybe think
differently about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we can allow animals to
receive what they should receive just as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as we can here in the U.K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been hugely informative, Chat Heidi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can get you back on again before
the end of the year and go over a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: topics because we've got so much more to
discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, we keep the show to 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can get to chat again very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in the next show, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
