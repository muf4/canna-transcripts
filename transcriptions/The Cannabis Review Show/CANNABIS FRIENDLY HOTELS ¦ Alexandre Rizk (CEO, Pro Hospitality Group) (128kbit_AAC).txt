[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Alexander Risk, who's the CEO of
[SPEAKER_01]: ProHospitality Group out in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Alexander?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing, sir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
little overview of your background and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you came to the CEO of ProHospitality
Group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make it as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from Montreal, Canada,
so I'm Canadian originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved to the United States about 17
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phoenix, to be precise, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered the hotel industry by becoming a
hotel broker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a commercial real estate agent,
but that focuses only on hotels for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 17 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company called ProHospitality Group is
my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three different divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a hotel brokerage division that we
still active at selling and brokering
[SPEAKER_00]: hotels for third-party investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have our own investment platform
where we own and operate 11 hotels now,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly in Arizona, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our first international deal that
we just bought as well in Haco,
[SPEAKER_00]: Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third division of the company is a
hotel brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly what we've been talked about
for the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Elevations Hotels and Resorts,
and with the affiliation and membership
[SPEAKER_00]: called Elevations Nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created that brand initially for our
first hotel that we have, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: boutique, funky hotel downtown Phoenix
called the Clarendon Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hotel was the first one to become
cannabis-friendly, the first lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: boutique hotel to be cannabis-friendly as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the concept was, I wouldn't say
complete, but on its way, we realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: we needed more locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that we tackled was Las
Vegas, Nevada, and where we purchased in
[SPEAKER_00]: March, 2022, the Artisan Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, it was the Artisan Hotel,
also a boutique independent hotel just
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the strip, really great
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: We purchased this, completely renovated
the hotel, rebranded it, and reopened it
[SPEAKER_00]: as the Lexi Hotel Las Vegas last June.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only been open for a couple of
months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a lot of things to fix, a little bit
of kinks to align to be fully operational,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to bring that concept to Las
Vegas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that we can provide luxury stays
and amazing experiences and a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas is a place to go and not necessarily
go meditate, but to go and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a place that we are trying to
craft those experiences around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely going to be a huge
space in the coming time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's really interesting,
do you mind if I give everybody a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: little history on the Lexi in Las Vegas?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to have a great history and
storied longevity so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's definitely one of the landmarks
in Las Vegas, especially if you consider
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's off the strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very well known with the local walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in its history, it had a
really gothic medieval theme to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was full of art everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceiling walls plastered with art and small
mirrors everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great for Halloween parties,
I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like you were entering into a
vampire movie sometimes, but it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: great gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became, at some point, one of the best
after parties spots, especially for the
[SPEAKER_00]: locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to bring that back,
actually, so we're making sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last six, seven years,
that kind of stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: The previous owners had a concept of
selling the whole hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called them buyouts, which kind of
put a dent into the ability to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: be open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly for the local business as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little bit challenging,
but it was well known for crazy lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: parties as well for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of Swinger Club,
let's call it what it is, that rented the
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to bring back the hotel to
where it used to be before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring our own concept there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we keep it very cheeky and fun,
we are one of the only three hotels in Las
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas now grandfathered in with a topless
pool license.
[SPEAKER_00]: European sunbathing, they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this open as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep the fun, cheeky, sexy part of it,
but we're trying to bring a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more class than what the property had for
the last six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know a lot of European people who
go to Vegas pretty regularly, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: your hotel would be a perfect destination
for a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a pretty successful industry
over in Arizona at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strategy for the hotel, it's obviously
got tourism on one side of the things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the amount of conferences and events
that happen in Vegas, we've got MJ BizCon
[SPEAKER_01]: and a number of massive, massive events
from November time and around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they a key part of the hotel's plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% they're a key part of the whole
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't survive in Las Vegas if you're
not playing the convention and group
[SPEAKER_00]: games.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not opposed to getting groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not opposed to catering to groups
for their needs, the parties, the
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-violet if you want, but we also want
to become and be back during the midweek
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the industry people that work into
those big casinos, that work into those
[SPEAKER_00]: tourist industry, we also want to be a
place where they can come and be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the locals' favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Thursday to Sunday, obviously this is
leisure and or conference people coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in, but from Monday to Wednesday,
we want to reopen our doors to the local
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no doubts it'll be successful with
that crowd on those time of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the consumption on
property, it's obviously there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing going on in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just consumption friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Phoenix, our concept works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can legally, as long as we are a hotel
and as long as we have a private
[SPEAKER_00]: membership on site and there's a few legal
maneuvers that need to happen in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: suspend our liquor license in some areas
of the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Phoenix, we have a private
membership lounge, the Elementary Nations
[SPEAKER_00]: Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our members that are paying members are
allowed to come and enjoy the hotel for
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, all the amenities of the hotel,
and they're allowed to bring their own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and go into our private members'
smoking lounge and enjoy the company of
[SPEAKER_00]: their friends or make new friends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enjoy the consumption of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also have 105 rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 16 of our rooms in Phoenix are
actually cannabis friendly, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you are a guest of the hotel and
you bring your own cannabis, you are more
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to smoke in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have restrictions about using tobacco,
so we're really pushing more for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's tobacco-less in terms of cannabis
because we can control the smell and the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell of cannabis, once it's properly
treated, it doesn't stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco does, and it's a big problem for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we keep tobacco out, but those 16 rooms
are cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're sponsored by some of our
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the team inside those rooms is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a rooftop bar where we can
suspend the liquor license and have the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of cannabis there, too, for specific
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Vegas, this is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the authorities right
now to change the laws or rewrite certain
[SPEAKER_00]: laws to allow us to do a similar concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until that's done, the only thing that we
can safely do right now is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: converted our main fourth floor as
cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them our 420 rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the fourth floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 428 to Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these rooms are equipped with Resto
Air equipment, and they're all hard
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're designed to be easily maintained,
even with the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are allowed to consume them
through the fourth floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those rooms will be also sponsored by
some of our partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, they're pretty generic
looking because they're the same that any
[SPEAKER_00]: other rooms in the hotel, with the
exception of a couple suites, but as a
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor's partners come in, they redesign
the room and make them their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems like a great branding
opportunity, as you said, if you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the big players at these big events
and walking in and there's a vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge on your pillow from one of these
top brands is a very good opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: these brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a plan to take the Lexi brand
national and possibly international then
[SPEAKER_01]: when European laws allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the brand itself is going to be
Elevations, Hotels and Resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lexi itself, there's going to be only
one Lexi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be Lexi Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my hotels for Elevations,
Hotels and Resort will be soft branded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Clarendon in Phoenix by Elevations,
Hotels and Resort, Lexi Las Vegas by
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevations, Hotels and Resort and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to grow into what I call
the occupancy square for our area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Vegas, Phoenix, LA, Palm Springs
and San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these markets feed each other for
almost 50 percent occupancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next ventures are going to be San
Diego, LA, probably two properties in LA
[SPEAKER_00]: and Palm Springs is on our target list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean we're not going to grow
bigger than that, but that's just the main
[SPEAKER_00]: focus right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Tulsa, Oklahoma that we have
intentions to break into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then up the coast, Colorado,
Oregon, Washington, obviously are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be an actual fit for us also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I would imagine New York when
the market matures that Tourism Central,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's going to be some new
hotels.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Miami just yet, but they're working on
it over there as well to legalize the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how things go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the East Coast, New York,
it could probably be the natural choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Carolinas are a good spot as well,
really hot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when and if possible, Florida is
obviously an easy one for us also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that ballot is going to measure now
soon, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying that ballot in Florida
is the recreational voters coming up,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it not, in the in the next couple of
months?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's next year actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same year in the in the federal elections,
2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see what kind of size market that
is already with some of the HHC and Delta
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 products already been sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would know Delta is a tourism hub for
Symbiote IQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're very busy, Alexander,
so I'm not going to take much more of your
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody from Europe who's gone to
Vegas, the LexiLasVegas.com website is
[SPEAKER_01]: below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be in all the various listening and
viewing spots of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, Alexander, thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to staying in a Lexi in
Las Vegas when I get over there soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to hosting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
Thank you.
Thank you.
