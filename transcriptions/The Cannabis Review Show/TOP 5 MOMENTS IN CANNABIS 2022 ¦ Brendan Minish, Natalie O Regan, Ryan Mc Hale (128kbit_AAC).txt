[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome everybody to the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a brilliant end of year special
for everybody now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we're going to go over the top five
moments in global cannabis of 2022 and to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that I'm delighted to be joined by
three of the leading voices in drug policy
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabis policy movement in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting up in your top right corner is
Natalie O'Regan.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you keeping Natalie?
[SPEAKER_00]: All good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoying the Christmas break so far?
[SPEAKER_03]: Delighted to hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next below that is Ryan McHale from Cran.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you keeping Ryan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delighted to have you on mate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have been very busy this year in
Ireland and last but not least is Brendan
[SPEAKER_03]: Minish from Cran as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you keeping Brendan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a good year so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot's happened and we have a bit to talk
about which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, lots to talk about now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best thing to do is just get
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start off with our first
topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've chosen five of the most
influential moments we think in both Irish
[SPEAKER_03]: and international cannabis and the first
one we're going to start off with is the
[SPEAKER_03]: Joint Justice Committee report that came
out in Ireland recently and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go around the room and give everybody a
chance to talk but Natalie, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: start with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give everybody a quick couple of
minutes brief of how you saw this report
[SPEAKER_03]: and the influences it may have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the report it's been ongoing for
about six to eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, Crane and many others were asked
to contribute to it at the time and the
[SPEAKER_00]: report was released just before the
Christmas break and when it was released
[SPEAKER_00]: that morning I don't think anybody in the
drug policy field or the reform field or
[SPEAKER_00]: any activist scene could have predicted
what was coming out of this report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a lovely welcome surprise to see
for once in Ireland a government report
[SPEAKER_00]: that is progressive, that is sensible,
that is not just filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitionist, reefer madness narrative
that we usually tend to see out of
[SPEAKER_00]: government documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was 22 recommendations
altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't specifically about cannabis,
it was regarding drug policy at a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did include some things regarding
like safe consumption facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction treatment and a host a load of
other things but the couple of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: really stood out for me were the fact that
the justice committee recommended a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more research into not-for-profit social
clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So social clubs are not new to the
cannabis scene, they're operating in many
[SPEAKER_00]: countries across Europe as it is and they
have worked well as a not-for-profit way
[SPEAKER_00]: of providing cannabis to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a justice committee to say that
social clubs need more research and how
[SPEAKER_00]: would social clubs work in Ireland,
it was a very, very advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for Ireland because
sometimes I do think along with many
[SPEAKER_00]: others that Ireland can be a bit
old-fashioned when it comes to drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: policy and I think they just don't know
what the future holds and they may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice to see that they are
acknowledging social clubs and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that these not-for-profit community
collectives can work and have worked in
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well on top of that which was highly
surprising was they recommended regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of certain drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't specifically name certain
drugs but you know the power of deducement
[SPEAKER_00]: you can kind of guess they're probably
talking about cannabis in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for again for a government report to
come out and recommend regulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend it in a way that we've been we
know for years and we have been asking for
[SPEAKER_00]: years like it is harm reduction it is
about taking the taking drug policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling it because drug policy or
drugs at the moment in the legal market is
[SPEAKER_00]: uncontrolled and that is the most damaging
aspect of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a report to come out and to say
that criminalisation hasn't worked,
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition has not worked and that we
need to do something about it is highly,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly welcome and I think Crane and
Brendan and everybody else in drug policy
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ireland will probably have thought the
exact same thing when we were reading the
[SPEAKER_00]: report that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll pass over to Ryan I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect thank you very much Natalie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan can you give us your little overview
and talk a little bit about what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: came from that such as your meeting that
you guys had with Frank Fain and the
[SPEAKER_03]: future work he's going to be doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so the report itself it was kind of
seen as great success from everybody and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it was because I think it covered
kind of all areas of drug policy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: consultation process that the Justice
Department had with groups they had
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis groups they had frontline groups
and they had youth workers against
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition and there's 22 recommendations
there that were extremely welcomed by all
[SPEAKER_01]: the groups when we were there for the
launch of the report and all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy groups were there they were all
delighted and because there was something
[SPEAKER_01]: there for everybody the consultation was
very well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of cannabis there was about three
recommendations that really stood out and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them was expanding the medical
cannabis access program which is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely needed and it's good that
that's represented there and as Natalie
[SPEAKER_01]: said the social clubs and the allowance of
currently illicit substances to be ground
[SPEAKER_01]: for non-profit and then the regulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all these aren't law yet and it's not
been enacted but it will be interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how the department responds and that
might be something we'll see now when the
[SPEAKER_01]: DAAL comes back in a couple of weeks time
and in terms of the Minister's response
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think when we met with the Minister
this report wasn't published yet so we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't actually know the recommendations
but we are looking to engage further with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Department of Health and they will
discuss these recommendations that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually out there now and so I think it's
a good four step I think and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely progressive it's extremely wide
region and if these recommendations can
[SPEAKER_01]: make it into law then I think we will be
seeing a bright future in terms of our
[SPEAKER_01]: drug policy climate going forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredible incredible so Brendan you've
been at this I think longer than most in
[SPEAKER_03]: Ireland what was the feelings that you got
you had from the report that was
[SPEAKER_03]: published?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was completely blindsided I expected it
to be the same as we'd normally see for
[SPEAKER_02]: these reports where often the body of the
document is actually pretty strong and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've encompassed carefully the views of
all of the respondents but then given them
[SPEAKER_02]: all equal weight and in this one it didn't
it actually came out it made strong clear
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations for which I'm very
thankful and what's more and I went up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the launch of it was James Lawless who
chaired the thing was very passionate
[SPEAKER_02]: about it he put the work into this he'd
done his diligent work and here he was
[SPEAKER_02]: representing it so I think that was all
very very encouraging this isn't a report
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just going to sit on the shelf and
from our perspective those of us who wish
[SPEAKER_02]: to see change it now takes us to a place
where you know 2023 is in part going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: about writing to our TDs to ask them what
are they doing to implement the
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations of the report and that's a
huge shift in terms of where we are in
[SPEAKER_02]: lobbying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the social club elements really
important and I think another interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that kind of happened on the day
actually that there was some political
[SPEAKER_02]: acceptance that you can't make black
markets go away magically and you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at you know reducing the harms and
you know that seems to have been
[SPEAKER_02]: encompassed in this don't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good and I suppose
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I mean really that's the gist of it
the main thing I think about this report
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as that it's looked at the wider
harms of drugs and it wasn't open to us to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at say just cannabis on its own nor
should we I think if we address the social
[SPEAKER_02]: harms across the spectrum here we'll end
up with much more sensible policy across a
[SPEAKER_02]: right a wide range of substances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah very well said very well said so
point number one was the Joint Justice
[SPEAKER_03]: Committee report top story number two
definitely for if you were living in
[SPEAKER_03]: Ireland was Gino Kenny's bill that he
brought to the dole so Ryan I know you got
[SPEAKER_03]: you were doing a lot of work with this and
then Natalie I'm going to give you an
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to speak after but Ryan can
you maybe tell us the importance of Gino's
[SPEAKER_03]: bill the chances of a passing and any
pertinent information that you'd have for
[SPEAKER_03]: the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so Gino's bill is kind of a long time
coming and I'm sure while we're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space you've been waiting for it
for I think about two years and finally
[SPEAKER_01]: came in quite a simple bill that would
decriminalise cannabis possession of up to
[SPEAKER_01]: seven grams of arable cannabis now it's
quite moderate it's not I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the it's the system that many of us want
and the long term I think Gino was aware
[SPEAKER_01]: that he realizes that and this isn't the
end I'll be I think in terms of passing
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I'm not sure if it will pass
and it's kind of open year at the moment I
[SPEAKER_01]: think with the way things are going with
with this justice report and kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Citizens Assembly they might be looking
for a more robust system than just
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization so they might actually
take it another way and it is important
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the sense that it's part of this
conversation that's starting to build and
[SPEAKER_01]: Gino's bill was introduced and a little
while back the week after Labour Party
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced a motion on decriminalization
and this report came out then a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks after so it's all kind of building
into the into the the national discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think one report or one bill or
one event is going to change things I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's it's a it's a collective
process of all these different and these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things happening at the same
time so I think it's positive and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come about I don't know if it's
going to pass it might be amended heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: and include more kind of safeguards for
regulation and things like that but then
[SPEAKER_01]: it's definitely a powerful step forward
and it increases the discussion on the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the quality of the discussion in
the country yeah for sure it's part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: snowball that seems to be gaining momentum
Natalie you were working on this a good
[SPEAKER_03]: bit have you got a little brief little
overview of any inside information for us
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so Gino's been working on to try and
get something on the floor of the Doil for
[SPEAKER_00]: over two years I think and in fairness to
him he put a lot of work in he got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of doors closed in his face he got a lot
of feedback back that he had to change
[SPEAKER_00]: plans about a million times but he
eventually got there through determination
[SPEAKER_00]: and stubbornness and putting the work in
there and what's the chances of it passing
[SPEAKER_00]: is anybody's guess it is a private members
bill so it is an opposition bill so it
[SPEAKER_00]: would require the current government to
side on with the opposition on this point
[SPEAKER_00]: which tech usually doesn't happen but sure
look never say never but even if it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't pass that's not the end of it like
this the the bill is on the Doil floor it
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to have to be debated on the Doil
floor for that to be debated we'll also
[SPEAKER_00]: get to hear politicians and elected TDs
what their view is on this topic they will
[SPEAKER_00]: have to stand up they will have to vote
yes or no yes or no against this at one
[SPEAKER_00]: point so if nothing comes out of it if
nothing else comes out of it we will force
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversation on the issue we will get
people's opinions and we'll get our
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians opinions and I think as well
as Ryan said Gino's decriminalization bill
[SPEAKER_00]: Labour put in a motion the following week
for a decriminalization of all drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the citizens assembly is coming up
this justice port committee report it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not an issue that can be ran away from
anymore it can't it's not an issue that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be just put on the back burner and
hope for and hope and pray that the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians will not have to tackle it
within their sitting term that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: pass the book to the next so I think it
brings the conversation to the floor and
[SPEAKER_00]: it forces people to have a conversation
about it if nothing else so I do think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an overall good thing if it passes
all the better if not we still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: million more avenues that we can go
through yeah as we said it's all part of
[SPEAKER_03]: this snowball that's gaining momentum so
moving outside of Ireland our first two
[SPEAKER_03]: topics and first two stories were a Joint
Justice Committee report Gino Kenny's bill
[SPEAKER_03]: that was proposed in Ireland so we all
agreed when it came to the European story
[SPEAKER_03]: that there was only kind of one or two
territories that you choose from and was
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany and the Czech Republic so I think
we're going to lead into the Czech
[SPEAKER_03]: Republic first how quickly do you think
Prague are going to be able to get this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry up and running now do you think
they're going to be able to get it done
[SPEAKER_03]: quicker than Germany start with you
Brandon yeah I think the Czechs have been
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting for to do this for a long time and
I think they'll hit the ground running I
[SPEAKER_02]: think they are more flexible in terms of
how they deal with and think about
[SPEAKER_02]: bureaucracy and yeah I'd say they'll be
able to speed for a while because the
[SPEAKER_02]: Czech Republic's been wanting this for
quite a while and I think it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed also into into the wider thing both
at the European level at the national
[SPEAKER_02]: level a lot of politicians have a lot of
catching up to do now with where popular
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion is both in terms of where the drug
policy in the round is working and what
[SPEAKER_02]: people want to see out of you know legal
regulated markets yeah couldn't agree with
[SPEAKER_03]: you more Natalie what are you thinking is
going to happen with Prague do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get there before Germany I
tend to agree with Brendan I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: will be all very surprised and Germany may
be the last ones to regulate but I do
[SPEAKER_00]: think that they will get there before
Germany I mean their national drug
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinator is well clued in he he's up to
speed he knows what he's talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: from the outside from my opinion like he
knows prohibition hasn't worked he knows
[SPEAKER_00]: control of cannabis is the future and is
the better approach to it like thereafter
[SPEAKER_00]: getting together a group of
representatives from all areas of society
[SPEAKER_00]: from police customs drug experts the
members of their parliament so they are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all views they're not just
listening to one side they're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole package again the whole views and I
do hope after this consultation I think
[SPEAKER_00]: this said around March I think that
they're they're planning for a regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market would be finalized so it'll be
interesting to see what comes out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am hopeful I do think that they they
have a good grasp of what needs to be done
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think they will power ahead with it
yeah gonna be very interesting to see Ryan
[SPEAKER_03]: do you see them being the European leader
to get going first or do you see any
[SPEAKER_03]: hurdles that may potentially happen for
them I think it'd be very interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch and I think all is wrong March from
this for this consultation process to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of be a to be revealed what's going on
there and I think in terms of roadblocks
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that I've seen there in the
news recently Germany are kind of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit caught up with themselves
with international law and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that and that seems to be a kind of
recurring issue in in kind of global drug
[SPEAKER_01]: policy reform that we always find
ourselves getting kind of our hands tied
[SPEAKER_01]: with international law and I think the
approach that the Canadians and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans took is probably the best
approach for us Europeans to take and just
[SPEAKER_01]: to ignore it and move on from this it's
kind of it's notoriously difficult to try
[SPEAKER_01]: and change those international agreements
on drugs or any international agreement
[SPEAKER_01]: just just with the geopolitical nature of
things like that so we'll be one to watch
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think you're definitely gonna see
more of this stuff with kind of EU or UN
[SPEAKER_01]: law coming up in the news but I don't
think it's gonna stop it fundamentally I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's just gonna be a little
roadblocks along the way but it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: good to watch the more countries that do
it the closer we get you know yeah very
[SPEAKER_03]: true I think it's a perfect scenario of
its better to ask for forgiveness than ask
[SPEAKER_03]: for permission when it comes to creating
your own policy of your own country when
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes to the cannabis industry as we've
seen with Canada and America right we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to move on to topic four so story
number three was Germany's advancements
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Czech Republic is advancements the
next one we're going to go on an
[SPEAKER_03]: international look and Thailand has been a
very interesting story over the last year
[SPEAKER_03]: and could be potentially over the next
couple of years with potential for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis tourism that far outweighs a lot
of other territories around the world
[SPEAKER_03]: Brendan can you talk to us about Thailand
and what's been going on over the past 12
[SPEAKER_02]: months well I'm not entirely up to speed
fully with Thailand but it seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: they've sort of they've created a bit of a
vacuum in a way by repealing some laws and
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving it there but I think some of the
pressure international pressure is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come from where their tourist footfalls
from I don't see the Australians as being
[SPEAKER_02]: too bothered but when the Chinese start
returning to Thailand in numbers there
[SPEAKER_02]: might be some pushback there around around
drugs policy I don't know I suppose really
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm interested to see is how do
markets develop when there are relatively
[SPEAKER_02]: few rules and what happens when you try
and regulate the market once it's started
[SPEAKER_02]: I think other markets that are interested
that have come like interesting that have
[SPEAKER_02]: come online recently is countries like
Argentina for example we don't hear much
[SPEAKER_02]: about it but Argentina's gone both
recreationally and medically legal and is
[SPEAKER_02]: dismantling its black market I'm not too
clear on how it's dealt with its
[SPEAKER_02]: international obligations around that but
you know the some countries are just
[SPEAKER_02]: ignoring the international obligation at
this stage I think for the US it probably
[SPEAKER_02]: hasn't come up yet because legalization
hasn't really happened at the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: level it's been more a case of state by
state yeah very very true there's been a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of interesting advances Mexico's up
there another one with Argentina I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that where they seem to be there Mexico
seems a bit stock at the moment actually
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I think very high court decisions
that they have to legislate but they
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't legislated yeah yeah I think
they're the closest and the most
[SPEAKER_03]: influenced by America and I think the
politics is having a lot to play there
[SPEAKER_03]: whereas I think countries that seem to be
a little bit more distanced away in South
[SPEAKER_03]: America seem to be pushed on or pushing on
without a undue influence yeah so
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes it's easier to just remove laws
than it is to design new ones but it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't necessarily mean the outcomes are
substantially better yeah no I couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: agree with you more but if we had the
greatest and smartest people as
[SPEAKER_03]: politicians running countries all over the
world would there be no need for this
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation to be taken place at this
moment in time but we've got to do our
[SPEAKER_03]: best as citizens to ensure that we're
getting given and delivered the best
[SPEAKER_03]: potential solutions and products for
people in each individual countries so
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got four we've got four topics that
we've touched off joint justice committee
[SPEAKER_03]: report, Gino's bill, Germany and Czech's
advancement and then international
[SPEAKER_03]: communities like Thailand, Argentina and
Mexico so I wanted to pick the last one
[SPEAKER_03]: and I thought it was I'd gone through a
ton of different things like you could
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about Juicy Fields, Spain launching
their medical program, the Czech
[SPEAKER_03]: announcement, the acquisition between PDT
and Columbia Care but I think the big one
[SPEAKER_03]: from America was Biden signing the medical
marijuana research bill and I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have huge implications in terms
of the amount of money that gets pumped in
[SPEAKER_03]: for R&D and the amount of potential let's
say the rarer cannabinoids that now get
[SPEAKER_03]: available for marketing for products so
what do you guys think of the Biden side
[SPEAKER_03]: of the medical marijuana research bill as
one of the most important stories,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan I'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Biden's been doing a lot now on
this on this cannabis front this research
[SPEAKER_01]: bill is going to open the door now for
America to be ahead of the game in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis research and what's been
what's going to be done there and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: the Safe Banking Act didn't go through
which is something that American people
[SPEAKER_01]: have been quite upset about in the
industry and in the in the cannabis space
[SPEAKER_01]: but in terms of research and things like
that I think America are going to be ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the game they're going to be the first
ones to do it and they're really invested
[SPEAKER_01]: in the medical markets where it all kind
of began for the Americans anyways so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're building on that there I would
like to see more stuff done on the
[SPEAKER_01]: expungement of prior criminal records with
cannabis I know it's not it's not being
[SPEAKER_01]: done federally I know it's kind of been
done a little bit state by state but I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: love to see more done on that kind of
going back to Thailand I know when they
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalized I think they released 4,000
prisoners in one day so it'd be great to
[SPEAKER_01]: see more kind of initiative taken on that
globally especially in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the notorious war on drugs going
on over there but it seems to be coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: an end thankfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah very true yeah actually Brendan what
do you think of the last topic Brighton
[SPEAKER_03]: signed the bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all progress I think until
the Safe Banking Act passed the impact of
[SPEAKER_02]: US federal law on cannabis is global
because it screws up with everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to use banks worldwide I mean it's
been a huge problem for Uruguay and is a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem still for legal cannabis companies
all over the world and I think there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a land grab on at the moment from
the pharma side to see what's paid for
[SPEAKER_02]: what's what are paid for products that can
be developed out of this I think the piece
[SPEAKER_02]: that the US is doing really badly on and
we need to keep an eye on is drugs policy
[SPEAKER_02]: overall in terms of overall death rates
they're way way worse than even us and
[SPEAKER_02]: Ireland is joint worst in Europe now so
you know what's happened in the US is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I'd be afraid of happening
here where they've separated cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: policy out completely from the rest of
drugs policy and allowed the rest of drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: policy which is the less popular bits of
it sometimes just sort of drown on the
[SPEAKER_02]: floor it's shocking so you know this is
why I think reform needs to stay lockstep
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not about individual substances it's
about the the overall overarching umbrella
[SPEAKER_02]: of things that come under substance
control actually and you know we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about legal cannabis markets here
but I think in time we'll be talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: legal markets or other products too
although perhaps much more regulated than
[SPEAKER_02]: any of us would like to see for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah very well said Natalie I'll give you
the final word what do you think of Joe
[SPEAKER_03]: Biden's recent work in the cannabis
sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I'm glad to see the R&D bill and the
research and development the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: research being able to go into cannabis
like one roadblock we always face when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are arguing for a reform of our cannabis
laws in Ireland even or across Europe is
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sure Ryan has heard it himself and
Brendan is oh we need more research we
[SPEAKER_00]: need more research we need more research
if I hear that I hear it in my sleep at
[SPEAKER_00]: this stage and with this bill we will have
more research like we I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact number anymore because I think
there's one new one being found every week
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't know half of the cannabinoids
that are in the cannabis plant we do not
[SPEAKER_00]: know the full extent of how beneficial
this plant can be from for as a valid
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for people so there are people
out there for years who will say oh I get
[SPEAKER_00]: relief of this and I get relief of that
but there is no scientific research into
[SPEAKER_00]: it so that is a block for expansion of the
MCAT expansion of other medical aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis so for the research and
development to be able to go into cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as a valid medicine it's a good thing
regardless of whether what side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: what side of the fence you are on
regarding pharmaceutical companies
[SPEAKER_00]: interests and in it either way it is going
to be a good thing I think and you know it
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to feed into worldwide cannabis
reform and especially for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and its medicinal properties for
people yeah evidence-based medicine I
[SPEAKER_03]: think is what every politician wants to be
able to hang their hat on and you can't do
[SPEAKER_03]: that unless you've got R&D budgets and
allocation of resources to be able to go
[SPEAKER_03]: and look at the potential of the hundreds
of cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids
[SPEAKER_03]: that can all be blended together for
potential whatever it may be the R&D needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to start in the labs with that but it's
been it's been great running through the
[SPEAKER_03]: year guys does anybody else have any other
topics outside the top five that we
[SPEAKER_03]: touched on that you think is worth a
mention I think this year I mean not just
[SPEAKER_02]: in Ireland but everywhere really this year
is the year when we all need to tell our
[SPEAKER_02]: politicians what we expect them to do they
might not agree with us that sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: they won't reply but we absolutely need to
remind them that we're here we're voting
[SPEAKER_02]: and we care about these issues yeah and to
that aim you know Cran we hope to have
[SPEAKER_02]: some templates out for people to do to
follow in the new year and I hope other
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations have been doing the same
because there are a lot of nuanced
[SPEAKER_02]: positions in this reform fight but we're
all looking at the kind of the same in
[SPEAKER_02]: broad brush strokes and goals which are
you know safer societies and happier
[SPEAKER_03]: people yeah agreed the cannabis industry
is so complex and nuanced that it takes
[SPEAKER_03]: years and years of research to be able to
get yourself remotely up to speed and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that's a very relevant thing I was
reading somewhere recently that when
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol prohibition ended in the States
that it took about 10 years for even 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: of the supply to move back from the black
market to the legal market we're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: period of transition we can't expect
everything to be perfect and rosy along
[SPEAKER_02]: the way we're going to learn a lot some
fun will be had lots of fun will be had
[SPEAKER_02]: money will be made some harms will be done
too and we need to be open to that we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to work out how to remain you know human
and compassionate and honest and fair in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry going forward but you know
it's all positive I think you know 2023
[SPEAKER_02]: and beyond are going to be good years in
cannabis yeah couldn't agree with you more
[SPEAKER_03]: and what's great is we're starting to see
a real ecosystem in Ireland take place and
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's sharing and helping each other
and long may that continue because I think
[SPEAKER_03]: we're a more powerful force and we're all
combining our resources than everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: working individually yes definitely right
we'll call it an end on that it's been a
[SPEAKER_03]: great 2022 guys and thank you very much

[SPEAKER_03]: off with a bang I know the cannabis review

[SPEAKER_03]: expansion and we look forward to seeing
