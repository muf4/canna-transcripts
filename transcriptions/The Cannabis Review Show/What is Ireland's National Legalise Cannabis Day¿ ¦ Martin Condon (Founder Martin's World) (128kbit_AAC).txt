[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this show
by a fellow Irishman and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leading cannabis activists in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is also an independent political
candidate and the founder and host of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hugely popular Martin's World podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martin, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very good Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much for having me on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all over the news with the campaign
you created recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give everybody a little overview
of what was the National Legalized
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Day and the campaign that you
brought about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was pretty impressive the
response that you seemed to have got from
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I suppose all credit has to go
really to Luke Ming Flanagan, who is the
[SPEAKER_00]: real creator of the National Legalized
Cannabis Day campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: He founded it back in 2001, in November
2001, November 5, 2001, when he went about
[SPEAKER_00]: and rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said to me in a recent interview over
400 cannabis joints and sent them to all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the politicians, senators, local
councillors and media also across the
[SPEAKER_00]: island of Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that got a great load of attention for
the campaign at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also delivered a cannabis plant to the
then National Drugs Minister in charge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the drug strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got arrested in the process of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never actually got to deliver the plant
to the minister as intended, but he got
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And following that campaign, Luke Ming
Flanagan told me he got over 65 radio
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I suppose this was pointed out
to me that this date was coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, well, this is the
20th anniversary of that date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, that's a significant
milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an event that was well worth
recreating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So myself, in a joint effort with other
campaigners here, Relief Cannabis Cafe,
[SPEAKER_00]: R420 Supplies, and the Cannabis Activist
Alliance, we set about rolling up over 200
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we printed out a nice list.
[SPEAKER_00]: The letter which highlighted the aim of
the campaign and at the back of the letter
[SPEAKER_00]: also included was 10 reasons why cannabis
prohibition should be ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also included within the letter then a
disclaimer because within with the letter
[SPEAKER_00]: included in the envelope was a cannabis
joint and a jelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we had a lot of hysteria here
in the media recently about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose to include a jelly just for
that side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the jellies were mostly Haribo from
the Kids Halloween bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a few CBD gummies put in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not too many of those are a bit
pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we sent those then off to all of the
media across the island are the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians across the island of Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the campaign was incredibly successful
within a couple of days as the letters
[SPEAKER_00]: started arriving because we sent them in a
kind of in a spread out fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't post all the letters at once
from the one post box because to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest, like when you had a bomb bundle of
20 of them, you could actually smell the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis coming out of the envelopes
because they weren't sealed up in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of staggered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the word he was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We staggered the post of that going out
and then like come the middle of the week
[SPEAKER_00]: following the 5th of November.
[SPEAKER_00]: We achieved what we wanted to,
which we got the nation talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: need for change around cannabis
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also then got out another campaigner,
Green Tea, who spoke on national radio on
[SPEAKER_00]: the National Airways as well about what
she's doing there, growing cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: her partner who's got late stages of
multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the campaign achieved much more
than what it set out to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wanted to get the nation talking,
but we actually got a few more campaigners
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the forefront now and standing up
and speaking against this inhumane
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very impressive campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you haven't had any kickback yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's come back and said anything to
you so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kickback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the guys up above in the
dial are getting more kickback to me
[SPEAKER_00]: because apparently they've got like a 30
million euro security system in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't effective enough to prevent a
couple of hand-rolled joints or even
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they did go back to the old scare
tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it was anthrax?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't compare our campaign to a move of a
terrorist organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis joints and anthrax, like they
should not be mentioned in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: headline at all unless their objective was
to try to muddy the waters around who we
[SPEAKER_00]: are and what we're doing, you know,
attaching us to a terrorist kind of fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very poor journalism that one
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I seem to think that in
Ireland at the moment, you've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians seem to be broken up into
maybe three or four different groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to got the the young,
knowledgeable ones who know all about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis know that there's nothing wrong
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know that's a billion dollar industry and
don't want to be the ones to put their
[SPEAKER_01]: neck on the chopping board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll back an industry once it's it's
got the right players involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I think on the contrast, you've got
the old people, the civil servants who
[SPEAKER_01]: might block this in the in the Department
of Health and what not that are just it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like heroin to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's completely uneducated,
ill-informed opinion on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the two of those worlds that
are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's what's happening in between
is the most interesting one, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: might have come from that world,
but they're open to learning and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know enough yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of up to people like us to
be doing good content and doing campaigns
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're doing to highlight how
nonsensical the current campaign is and
[SPEAKER_01]: that the war on drugs has been lost long
ago, that this now needs to be looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: like every other country I think is
starting to pivot into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually brings me into the next
topic I wanted to bring up to you is
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany legalizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on this so far and
the three coalition parties that have come
[SPEAKER_01]: together now to create a recreational
cannabis industry with first products
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold within 12 months from now,
I think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that the most attractive
thing to me about Germany's move is their
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that the line of coffers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually to remove the criminal body
that currently exists within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis prohibited, it's in control
of the organized crime gangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the German government have kind of
identified this as being a big problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to achieve harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them, they've seen the most
effective way of achieving harm reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: around cannabis is to regulate it,
to control it in a true sense of the word
[SPEAKER_00]: control, because we talk about cannabis
and all of these other drugs as controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs, but they're they're anything but
under a model of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the most attractive
thing about the conversation there within
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, it's like, well, the money is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking about five billion euro
and a multi billion euro saving for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice Department to have to enforce
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having to occupy the prison cells and
all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think is the best part of the
conversation is the control of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the harm reduction around cannabis and the
removal of the organized crime gangs from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that Germany are very successful
over the next four years as it is a four
[SPEAKER_00]: year trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the four years,
they'll come back and they'll review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's open to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope the findings are as to be
expected, which is that, yes, ending
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, regulating cannabis will
achieve what they're setting out to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is eliminate the organized crime
gangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need these organized crime gangs
in our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough bad players out there
without creating a fictitious system for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to exist within, which is prohibition
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to send shockwaves
then across the rest of Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: because as we're having conversations here
in Ireland, those dinosaurs that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned within the ranks of our
government, it'll be much harder for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to discredit the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: around this now, because for them to say,
oh, that's a foolish idea, they can't say
[SPEAKER_00]: it anymore because it's like, well,
you send a German government currently as
[SPEAKER_00]: a foolish people that they're making a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think any of our ministers
would want to get on the bad side of
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany because they're a big player over
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that this is a great
opportunity for us as campaigners here
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, because the conversation,
it's going to be a lot harder for the
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitionists to keep up their arguments
because it's like a house of cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: their arguments, they're falling and
they're down to the bottom tier now at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment, like we're ready to just clean
house with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because next year as we move into next
year in Ireland, we've got Gino Kenny's
[SPEAKER_00]: bill, we've got the Citizens Assembly
coming up, so many avenues for
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, for change to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the German stuff is just going to
really enrich that conversation now for us
[SPEAKER_00]: on the anti-prohibition side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they're sandwiched in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got legalisation in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got legalisation in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just going to be a slow march
in towards us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they've got any sense, it's about
replacing the criminals with a refined
[SPEAKER_01]: legal industry and having a bit of common
sense as they look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last topic I wanted to talk to you
just before you move on to the last one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just worth to be saying as well that
like Germany are not alone within Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've Luxembourg, there's Malta,
we've Portugal, there's many countries now
[SPEAKER_00]: within the European Union looking at
changing their laws around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are restricted because
of the International Narcotics Control
[SPEAKER_00]: Board, which is why Germany are choosing
to use the phrasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a research period, a four year
research period, because the International
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcotics Control Board who kind of
control the laws around narcotics within
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, they wouldn't allow a country to
actually legalise cannabis because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem brought up by Gino Kenny there
recently, as that would be in violation.
[SPEAKER_00]: of European law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a research project, that's within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, Germany aren't alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've big waves being made over here in
Europe next year from many countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, sorry, I just wanted to get that
in before you went on to the last topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all, mate, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're completely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next topic that I did want to jump
in on was the first MCAT patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of headlines recently
there, a lot of pizzazz and jazz about
[SPEAKER_01]: behind all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of a step forward do you think
this is, or is it more pressing headlines
[SPEAKER_01]: and publicity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great step forward in one
sense, because no patients, some,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, we could talk about the medical
cannabis access program and it's like at
[SPEAKER_00]: the most, it's a regime that the North
Korea would, a program in North Korea
[SPEAKER_00]: would be proud of because of how
restrictive and controlling it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: because effectively, no patients are able
to get access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've Alicia Marr out there suffering
with chronic pain, living on Alicante and
[SPEAKER_00]: gets access to cannabis and it does for a
tremendous benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she won't get access under the medical
cannabis access program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the patients who do, this is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tremendous step forward for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's three conditions listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nausea associated with cancer,
the multiple sclerosis, baloney,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spasticity associated with multiple
sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is the refractory type
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all of those patients have to have
undergone standard conventional treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: and that treatment has to be unsuccessful
for them to be considered accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, while having one patient on it,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, there's a long way to go for
the patients who could benefit from this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently added, and I think this is
the most noteworthy thing actually outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first patient getting access,
is they've actually added two cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flower products now to the medical
cannabis access program.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is a 22% THC variety of
cannabis from Bedrikan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is, I believe, 13 and a
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: percent THC variety from Bedrikan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they've got a content of CBD
in the region of about 1% as well in both
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this does, again, for us as
campaigners here in Ireland, is it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel, it's more ammunition for us to use
to counter the arguments of the
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitionists.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can they tell us that the cannabis
plant that's being grown by a person who
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to mitigate maybe the onset of their
glaucoma or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe to reduce the effects of their
arthritis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we tell them that they're a
criminal and what they're using is not
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal when we now have cannabis
flowers included on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this cannabis flower in some way
superior?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is, please prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can see how they can justify
having one regarded as a medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, the other is like,
no, no, no, you're a criminal and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous drug that you're dealing with
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only one I would say with that is what
I seem to think what they've done is that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody like Denmark has got this
ornamental flower pharmaceutical industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they know how to grow a rose a million
times over the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is what Bedrikan have
done is that they've kind of given a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific method, let's say, that they can
guarantee that every single bud of flower
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be this exact percentage of
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's where they're getting
around the loophole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not to say that homegrown laws
shouldn't be in essence a part of any law
[SPEAKER_01]: or any industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes into Ireland, it's a must,
I think, for the whole industry to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to agree on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think they're using maybe a tissue
culture method, which might be outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the realms of possibilities for the
conventional gardener out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still cloning like cloning a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's well within the realms of
possibilities for a conventional gardener
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is quite consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you were to end prohibition
and if you had access locally to a service
[SPEAKER_00]: that would test your cannabis,
then you could see if you're if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a program, your gardener gardening
program at home is consistent in putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out the variety of cannabis that you need
for whatever conditioners that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it's not, again, if you as a
conventional gardener, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat trained to blend these different
extracts and you could, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: blend them to make your own consistent
ratio of cannabinoids there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, the prohibition of cannabis is
what makes it impossible for people to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we remove prohibition,
the cannabis will make it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at the medical cannabis
access program like and a 50 milliliter
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of one of these extracts that
that's currently under the Canon E-Pilt
[SPEAKER_00]: that that recent that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going with the 50 mil bottle,
which is the most kind of cost saving one,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you go for the lower bottle,
it's even more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works out as it's four hundred and
fifty odd euro for the whole bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the amount of cannabinoids that
are in there, it works out of being about
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 euro per gram of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like 100 milligrams of THC for per
milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's five milligrams of CBD per
milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you work it out, you know,
a great cost down, like when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at just the active ingredients,
if that's what you're after going from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of that per gram, it's more expensive
than gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold currently is 50 euro per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, our government are buying
in cannabinoids that are more expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: than gold per weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is absolutely crazy when you could
grow this stuff out your backyard and
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine you could grow something out your
backyard and that's more expensive than
[SPEAKER_00]: gold currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fell over mountains at the moment to
get access to gold, like the ruining or
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, you could pop a few seeds
and you've got something that's just as
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable and more beneficial than gold,
because really beneficial as gold outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of maybe the computer stuff you do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, agreed, agreed, agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got a lot to look forward to
now in 2022 and hopefully this major steps
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead with Gino's bail and a lot of other
things coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the number one thing you're looking
forward to next year before we jump off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Feed the Birds campaign here in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to launch a Feed the Birds
campaign again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some fun events and a
run up to it through January or February
[SPEAKER_00]: or March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just before we get into that growing
period, you know, April, May and June and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, we're hoping to give away a lot of
free seeds to people to promote the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Feed the Birds campaign,
if people don't know about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just encouraging people to use hemp
seeds to feed birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully, you know, these hemp
seeds might sprout up a few cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants around the place, which might
gather the attention again from the media
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the conversation happening again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I really look forward
to again next year is the Feed the Birds
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign and all of the events coming up
because the calendar is really filling up
[SPEAKER_00]: there now for Ireland and the cannabis
community for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big things to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great to hear, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to hear and look forward to all that
we have got to come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost home now in the next 12
months ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again for taking your time to
come on the show, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody who's haven't checked out,
check out Martin's world on all the social
[SPEAKER_01]: channels and his own YouTube channel as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very good show and very
educational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again, Martin, for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, we will chat on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
