[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
Cannabis View.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join this episode by
Cyrus Engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today Cyrus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good day to you and to all those who are
following the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're a man who's got a wealth of
knowledge and information for everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick little overview of how you came to
[SPEAKER_01]: be nominated for the European Parliament
for Malta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a member of the Labour Party in
Malta.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our elections in 2019 as the rest
of the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all member states elected their members
of the European Parliament and I was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those elected on behalf of the Labour
Party throughout this mandate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mandate is now coming to a close
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's our last year as members.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of the Socialist and Democrats
here in the European Parliament and my
[SPEAKER_00]: main committee is the Environment and
Public Health Committee but then I was
[SPEAKER_00]: also a substitute in the committee on
civil liberties, justice and home affairs
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the committee on constitutional
affairs of the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many topics that from one aspect or
another could relate to cannabis both as
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for medical use and also on
cannabis for personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping you're going to be the
perfect man to answer some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: questions that I'm about to ask you right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, which country of the
European Union is the most advanced when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to cannabis policy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's very difficult to say because
different member states have different
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could discuss and speak which would be
the best approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that said, I think that different
approaches could work in different ways in
[SPEAKER_00]: different member states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what we did in Malta is
something which is quite revolutionary to
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain extent in the sense that we are
one of the few member states in the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Union that have not only
decriminalized cannabis but have also
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized it in a certain way in the sense
it is not possible for anyone to go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: shop and buy cannabis which is not medical
or which is not in certain products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I'm saying this in order to
simplify things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can grow your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a system where we have removed
profits from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the individual would grow their own
plant, would grow their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, if you do not have
the ability to grow your own, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pull together in an association with other
people and you would have what maybe we
[SPEAKER_00]: are used to usually in other language
called social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have called these associations where a
number of people can join together in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to pull their five plants per person
and therefore be able to grow the plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: an environment which is more suitable for
the plant to grow or else if someone would
[SPEAKER_00]: not have space within their own homes or
apartments, they would be able to do so in
[SPEAKER_00]: a pooling of resources, let's say,
in order to grow your own plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing that different member
states are now moving forward on
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization and legalization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing what's happening in Germany
at the moment, what was happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg but which was paused for some
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different approaches that in Germany
and Luxembourg, the thinking is more of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing cannabis in a way that people
would be able to buy and sell certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strands or a certain type, let's say,
of cannabis within their own member state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brings on a number of problems which
we might be able to speak on later on,
[SPEAKER_00]: problems or challenges that come up
because of European Union legislation with
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to the Schengen Act, so the way
that we move freely, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can move goods and products and
services freely between the European Union
[SPEAKER_00]: member states, but when it comes to
cannabis, that would be a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some challenges cropping up
in the way that other countries are
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of and moving forward their
legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself, as a socialist, would also find
a problem in the fact that big
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical companies would end up
taking control of the market of cannabis,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems to be very interesting the
way things are panning out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of word from Luxembourg about
a year or a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a lot of waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be the Czech Republic are now
the darling of Europe and may surpass
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and have a legal adult market
before then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is a possibility with
the Czech Republic to surpass Germany and
[SPEAKER_01]: be the first?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not surprised because, well,
it is surprising and not at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: because the current governing coalition in
the Czech Republic has the Czech pirates
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a green party and they're quite
revolutionary and they work a lot on such
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does not surprise me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing is that they're in a
coalition with, I wouldn't say a
[SPEAKER_00]: government coming from the right,
because it's not even said the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a bit surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I guess when they were discussing
the priorities of the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pirates probably pushed a lot as one
of their main priorities for the new
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it has surpassed Germany,
not surprising either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, today, Germany has a very
progressive alliance governing the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Germany being the biggest member
state, also, I'm not saying that other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries do not do this, but what I'm
seeing is the approach in Germany is one
[SPEAKER_00]: that is leading the German government to,
first of all, make sure that they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: line with the United Nations Convention on
Psychotropic Substances, the 1971
[SPEAKER_00]: convention, that what they're doing
therefore then would be in line with the
[SPEAKER_00]: framework decision of the European Union
law, which is linked to the Schengen
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement of 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what's happening is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is testing the waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's testing the legal waters before going
on to this step of actually legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something which might not have been done
by others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to consider legalizing within
your member state and having trade only
[SPEAKER_00]: within your member state, that might not
be necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want, and this is obviously
something that would happen, that there
[SPEAKER_00]: would be trade within the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say cannabis is legal in
Luxembourg and it's legal in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Germany and Luxembourg share a border.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you move with your cannabis product
for your person and use from Germany to
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg?
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the European law,
you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the United Nations,
you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what Germany is looking at at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so facilitating the commerce and the
logistics of the product or the capital in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry is what Germany seem to be
focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you said, if they can do
everything within house, the only reason
[SPEAKER_01]: to go for these extra rules would be far
thinking ahead to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, we want to be able to ship from
Spain to France to Germany and them doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the issues that Germany is seeing
is that it might not have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable weather to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, they believe that there
should be a European Union system in which
[SPEAKER_00]: there could be free trade between the
member states, as we have on all other
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, they are thinking in
advance on how would this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the current legal framework,
from what we're gathering, it would not
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what they're looking at and
what we need to change in order for this
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that may be able to
facilitate that happening is something I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to ask you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the European-wide testing program or
standard for CBD and cannabis that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: place, or is that something that needs to
be produced and built from the ground up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because surely that's kind of the main
components of facilitating commerce
[SPEAKER_01]: between the different countries is that
we've got a standardized testing for every
[SPEAKER_01]: product that we can be ensured that
nothing too strong or too weak has been
[SPEAKER_01]: shipped within countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That process is something that then will
be discussed within the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: committee, because it includes also public
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably, but I think I'm not the most
qualified person to speak on this aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of the legislation, is saying what happens
within the European Medicines Agency,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, but I am not sure about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather not comment on something
which I'm not too technical on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather focus on the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see a scenario in Europe where
biotechnology companies that can produce
[SPEAKER_01]: purified biosynthesized cannabinoids end
up taking the larger market share and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're then left with an ornamental flower
industry and a social book where the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry almost splits perfectly in half,
that this is the recreational model now
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is going to be everything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is something which I'm
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we really need to look at
where do we start this conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does this conversation start from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the point of departure is
the fact that people should have their
[SPEAKER_00]: human rights respected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a system where we have harm
and risk reduction as much as possible in
[SPEAKER_00]: various fields when it comes to substance
use or drug use, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that one of the main issues
that we need to look at is to have
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis users being treated, first of
all, with dignity, that they're doing no
[SPEAKER_00]: harm to anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If at all it is something which a person
is doing within the confines of their own
[SPEAKER_00]: being and not affecting anyone else,
everyone has the right to bodily autonomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where I go from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people using cannabis in
this sense and other drugs in reality
[SPEAKER_00]: should not be imprisoned, should not be
arrested because they are smoking a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, using certain substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that should be our point of
departure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I look at this whole issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is in the sense that I really
pushed even back home in order to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: system which is not there to profit big
pharmaceutical companies, but a system
[SPEAKER_00]: that would give each individual their
right to bodily autonomy, to agency,
[SPEAKER_00]: their right to actually do something which
does not affect anyone else and which they
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore should be allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to have that, my take on
this, and when the Maltese government came
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the consultation process before
actually proposing the law, as an office
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we submitted a very strong case for
the way we wanted this proposal to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very happy to see that when the
actual proposal was published by
[SPEAKER_00]: government, it was very similar to what we
were proposing originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do other systems work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably other systems could work,
would work, but who would benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where I might digress from
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that this should be done for
the benefit of the individual and not for
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefit of some huge pharmaceutical
companies that have already monopolized a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of drugs, medicines, therapies,
et cetera, all around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, that is the point of departure
and why we should discuss this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, given the fact that a number of
member states are opting for a different
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of legislation, like the Czech
Republic, Germany, like what Luxembourg
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to do, that obviously brings
about other discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a discussion on freedom of movement,
a discussion of trade between member
[SPEAKER_00]: states when it comes to cannabis being
another product, like all other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over there, yes, we do need to have a
very strong discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is for that reason that last year
in July, a group of us, so it started
[SPEAKER_00]: between myself and a member of the
European Parliament from Czechia,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikuláš Pesta, who's from the Pirate Party
in the Czech Republic, we joined forces
[SPEAKER_00]: together to discuss the European side,
the point of view of the legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a number of member states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this interest group in the
European Parliament where we sent out an
[SPEAKER_00]: email to all members and asked all those
who were interested to join us in this
[SPEAKER_00]: intergroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have joined and we have now a very
strong intergroup from different member
[SPEAKER_00]: states and from different political
groupings here in the European Parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cover, I believe, five out of the
seven political groupings in the European
[SPEAKER_00]: Parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have regular meetings where we
discuss the future of European Union
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation and what should happen at the
European level given the fact that a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of member states have now legalized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, this could be seen as going
or conflicting, let's say, with the United
[SPEAKER_00]: Nations Convention on Psychotropic
Substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with the union law framework
decision, which is linked to Schengen and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore linked to the United Nations
automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that there should be some
change in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it is very difficult to bring
about this change because over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not speaking of one small amendment
to a law, but we would actually need to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the union structures, basically,
the union principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schengen is one of those very important
principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was one of the most popular,
let's say, principle because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: brought in within the freedom of movement
of people, services, capital, and goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in it, there is this one line,
which does not come directly from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it comes from the United Nations
Convention of 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one which states that you cannot
cross borders with a number of substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they list a number of substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those substances listed is
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We either remove this at United Nations
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you remove cannabis from being one of
those substances mentioned in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: Nations Convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or else, in our agreement of the framework
decision of the European Union,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would make reference to the United
Nations Convention, but excluding cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: from one of those substances that you
cannot move across borders with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the kind of discussion that we
are having.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe our own Luke Flanagan from
Ireland is part of the group of
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians that you have going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I let you go, just a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rating from 1 to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 being most likely, 1 being least
likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which of these countries is going to
legalize in the next three, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: three to five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of 10, Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the elections in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if we keep on having a
progressive government, then we can move
[SPEAKER_00]: towards that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the shift goes towards the right of
conservatives, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: And France.
6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were the elections recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the progressives, the
socialists have won.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a good chance of them
moving towards this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say it depends on from
which side you look at it, half empty or
[SPEAKER_00]: half full.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say something between five to
seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about little old Ireland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think Ireland is an interesting
case because I often make comparisons
[SPEAKER_00]: between my country more than Ireland
because we share a similar past.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very similar roots when it comes
to a conservative Catholic upbringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the same for instance, discussions
that Ireland had on abortion that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: currently now having at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland had a number of interesting
discussions when it came to LGBTIQ rights,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we have done back home and we have
done that very strongly now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're the first in all of Europe when
it comes to LGBTIQ rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a similar thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be more cautious about Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both the major political parties
are quite cautious on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's the, I don't know what
the name of the party is, which were
[SPEAKER_00]: Lukman Flanagan, Mick Wallace and others
for part of this political party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is, the name of it,
but I think they would be very much in
[SPEAKER_00]: favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about the mainstream parties,
let's say in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Ireland's got a really interesting
one to see whether we end up being the
[SPEAKER_01]: gateway country into Europe for North
American companies and de facto through
[SPEAKER_01]: the capital and the jobs being created
that it makes sense to decriminalize and
[SPEAKER_01]: then legalize the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be an exciting couple of
years ahead for Europe where there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: stepping stone that's guaranteed to be
solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all we can do is learn and sharpen our
swords and be ready for battle when the
[SPEAKER_01]: time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's also a difference over
there with regards to which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you adopt the Maltese model,
then what you just said would not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you adopt the Czech model,
that would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyrus, I know you're a very busy man,
so thank you very much for taking the time
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much appreciated and all the best on
all the political projects you've got for
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, it was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
