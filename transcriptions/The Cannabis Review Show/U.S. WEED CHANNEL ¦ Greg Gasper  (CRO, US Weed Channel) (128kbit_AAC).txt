[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of The
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Greg Gasper, who's the CRO at US Weed
[SPEAKER_01]: Channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Greg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of your position at
[SPEAKER_01]: US Weed Channel and how you came into the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so Chief Revenue Officer currently at
the US Weed Channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are obviously a cannabis TV station,
but really built to be a global cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: media platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, been in the business most of my
life, or you know, the plant has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of my life since my teens,
but formally and professionally started in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rec market in about 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Washington state, launched one of the
premier CBD brands that got into Dillards
[SPEAKER_00]: and Selfridges, as you would know,
in the UK, Lane Crawford in Hong Kong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brand was Wildflower Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that position promoted me and moved me
to Los Angeles, where I ran a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated licenses there and really built,
I feel like that was the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the foundation of my career was that move
to Los Angeles there and my connections to
[SPEAKER_00]: that community where the major project
that I was leading was we were one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leading E's delivery depots in Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was an amazing experience getting
to work with, you know, one of the premier
[SPEAKER_00]: tech platforms in cannabis at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a colorful experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long story short, the Wildflower
company purchased those licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were never signed over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of left myself in a strange
position in the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And decided to move to Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I cut my teeth here in
this market where I currently have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Phoenix, Arizona, getting to work to help
launch some of the premier brands here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the top eight brand in the state and fuse
and launching their CBD CBG wellness brand
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually working with Shango as
sales director, which is the top flower
[SPEAKER_00]: brand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so long story long, my journey
was through more or less you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: touching and selling almost every
ancillary part of the business from
[SPEAKER_00]: finished goods to hardware to tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what brought me here to
the TV channel where I met Shane late last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I heard what he had was kind of
like, what, how do I join?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what brings me here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you Owen for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there seems to be a massive gap for a
platform for cannabis media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be a hole that you guys
look primed to be able to fill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind maybe give me elaborate a
little bit on what you think the platform
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis media looks like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it going to involve a wave of M&A
activity of the best offerings to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and bring them all under one
umbrella like current media would do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, generally speaking,
I think, you know, whether you're a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: or a leading creator or voice in the
industry, we are at the will of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: pet giants, the YouTubes, particularly as
the host, you know, for storing that
[SPEAKER_00]: content and distributing it mostly for
creators from Instagram and LinkedIn,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly, you know, my experience in
the rec market, pretty jaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram having, you know, dozens of
accounts shut down and banned and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some pettiness of reporting each
other and all of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that happen when you're at the will
of one of these tech giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of these creators are able
to monetize the content that they create.
[SPEAKER_00]: And companies, whether you are a direct
cannabis brand or an ancillary product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not able to market your product to
reach the end consumer, especially through
[SPEAKER_00]: paid ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fine line of what you post
versus getting thrown in jail and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of the basis of what we
want to build here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be a platform for the voice of
the global cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that is a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone interested in learning
more on the educational side of it or a
[SPEAKER_00]: company looking to reach the global
cannabis audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also seems to me that there's a massive
gap for the content creation side of this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for such there's so many
potential stores that could be turned out
[SPEAKER_01]: of from this sector, like they've done
with some of the WeWork shows or kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: these kind of elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's enough details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a publisher that's able to actually
go out and purchase these shows or movies
[SPEAKER_01]: and then sell them on to bigger
opportunities seems like a very good
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, advertising partners that
come to join the channel, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent of that money stays within the
cannabis community one because 70 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: or so of those funds will be going towards
the production of a new show, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: asset that we will share together as the
ad brand to help produce it as now with
[SPEAKER_00]: that show is brought to you by that brand
of perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is now, again, an asset of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that show blows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put that on Amazon Prime streaming
or Hulu or Netflix and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not limited to our network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are able to take it to the masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also able to lease content for major
production studios to play on our channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sony and Paramount in particular,
we can pick from those Rolodex's,
[SPEAKER_00]: lease that content and have it brought to
you by your favorite brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of your favorite, you know,
cannabis movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold and Kumar go to White Castle could
be brought to you by White Castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or brought to you by your favorite brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the possibilities really are endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's I feel like part of the
challenge here in the United States in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular is, you know, I don't think
people really believe it that we're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as I said, of all the sectors that
we analyze from the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: from biotechnology to cultivation,
retail, the media side of it seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the biggest markets that you could
potentially get into with the fewest
[SPEAKER_01]: competitors in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like whoever gets in and
becomes the dominant leader now has to
[SPEAKER_01]: build the whole foundations and the
building itself, whereas cultivation could
[SPEAKER_01]: take expertise from another industry and
bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think making cannabis media would have
to involve, I would imagine, a blend of
[SPEAKER_01]: either consumers or industry expertise to
be able to ensure that the content is as
[SPEAKER_01]: factual and correct as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you nailed it because I often get
asked a question to the effect of,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, who are you trying to reach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to reach companies or are
you trying to reach consumers?
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you're a global channel,
but you're US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is, we are all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to reach the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers want to know about the brands
and companies and how it's cultivated,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do a tour of the manufacturing
facility or lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important for consumers to
see from their top brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus, partnering with us, we want to
give as much ROI and ROAS back to you as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, which automatically brings the
CEO onto a talk show that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a satire comedy talk show,
and really just crank up that partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it mutually beneficial, which I think
is another thing that companies here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US are apprehensive about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say part of what connected you
and I here, Owen, was my outreach this
[SPEAKER_00]: year to particularly the European markets
and their excitement actually in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the US side, I hear it's like,
oh, yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see, sort of thing, where the
European side is more like, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you built something amazing and let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to the move when we have a lot of
emanation activity across the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say schedule three allows that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big brands that end up coming out on
top that control massive portions of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, it would be the most prudent
thing for them to have a large capex
[SPEAKER_01]: budget for content creation, a la the Red
Bull model, where it's more sense to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to create our own content and
generate consumers as opposed to targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: billboards and ads on TV, which might
necessarily be preferential for the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-cannabis-consuming or the
non-cannabis-favorable side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that one of the medium to long-term
strategies that you guys are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, when this does happen, these budgets
for these billion-dollar companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be available to actually write
some serious checks to create some real
[SPEAKER_01]: content?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we all know, everybody at this
moment is self-made content, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: budgets behind a lot of stuff could be a
hell of a lot better once they had access
[SPEAKER_01]: to that capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long story short, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strategy is to increase the production
value and to not just the production value
[SPEAKER_00]: of podcasts and news shows, stock trading
shows, and other educational and cooking
[SPEAKER_00]: shows that we will be producing,
but just leveling it up each quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to your point, as things go schedule
three, if they do, I'm not confident in
[SPEAKER_00]: that personally, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will change in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already see the Pabst Blue Ribbons and
some of the big dogs entering the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's when you'll continue to see
that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those brands, the brands that we know
that are imprinted in our brains,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they know how to market,
and they spend money on media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those productions are getting their
voice out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you made a great example when you
mentioned Red Bull.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of parallels to
what we can do with Red Bull.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think X Games and the yacht races and
the plane races and all the cool stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually that unique stuff that Red Bull
produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's generally a lot of what we
will be doing over here at the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be having our own sports leagues
and e-sports and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can expect that from us,
but obviously with our cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: twist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think of it, I guess we're kind of
like the new MTV in a way almost is a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of our model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, comedy, music, sports, I think the
Venn diagram of those three things kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sits perfectly in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can get a global audience
viewing those three different genres,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I think as a said, you've got a
recipe successful in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, the sky is really the
limit for what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, the vision of the
companies that choose to enter a media
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership with us is, you know,
those first partners are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: large part in, you know, forming the
direction of the channel into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting this year, really, again,
the enthusiasm from Europe has got me
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that I think a lot of
companies that are eyeing that market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they see huge potential,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see opportunity beyond what's
here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly difficult, again,
here to market and operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's kind of the
new horizon that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that are already there,
you know, they see advertising on a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: channel as that bridge, you know,
to gain more brand awareness from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, probably the largest legal
cannabis market in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So or country, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been incredible talking to you and
going through the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who hasn't visited the site
yet, the website is below and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: description wherever you watch or listen
to this podcast, hopefully we get to touch
[SPEAKER_01]: base again in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg can hear more about the future
expansion for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an honor and look forward to
chatting with you again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
