[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everybody, to another episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much to everybody for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Pia Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the co-founder and CEO of Cannabum
AG over in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pia, how are you keeping you well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a lady making a lot of news in
Europe at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give the guys a little
overview of how you got to Cannabum?
[SPEAKER_00]: And your journey of the industry so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Pia Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the CEO and co-founder of the Cannabum
AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to provide patients in Germany
and Europe with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our vision is that every patient
deserves the best therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis as a medicine, or cannabis in
general, I think is a highly stigmatized
[SPEAKER_01]: topic here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during my studies abroad, in the
Netherlands, for example, I was surprised
[SPEAKER_01]: by how different the approach from society
was there regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was much more accepted there than
it is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when medical cannabis got legalized
here in Germany in 2017, I knew I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to work in this industry, in this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after conducting intensive research
about medical benefits, talking to doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: and patients, I was really touched by
their stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always wanted to do something
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current state of knowledge is that
cannabis can really heal, but it can
[SPEAKER_01]: improve patients' quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Federal Institute for Drugs and
Medical Products, also called B-Farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're running a non-interventional
survey for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they track indications and
improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the typical patient, for example,
is a chronic pain patient, mostly over 50
[SPEAKER_01]: years old, and has been in chronic pain
for more than 10 years, mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with medical cannabis as a medicine,
those patients can be helped, quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: life can be improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't heal, but it can improve
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can improve patients' quality of life,
which is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, so what I've learned about
cannabis as a medicine, it's the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: it has for patients hasn't been fully used
yet or fully developed yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to improve access to medical
cannabis for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to provide medical cannabis
that is sunlight grown and free of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I founded the company with my
co-founder, Marius Cosa, in 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: to do exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why sunlight grown and free of chemical
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a sustainable approach is very
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I worked at Knovung,
I worked in the field of renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore, I see a lot of a lot of
similarity between the industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sustainability is very important to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore, we found a Knovung with a
different approach than our competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to provide medical cannabis
that is sunlight grown and free of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after all, cannabis is a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs light and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the best approach in
that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, I'm going to skip to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the third topic, and we can come
back to the second, because we kind of led
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Europe's supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just talking about sunlight grown
flower, no pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Heidi Whitman on a couple of days
ago on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a similar model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your flower grown in a
specific part of the world that allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight to be grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what territory is your supply coming
into Europe from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't say exactly from where,
but it's the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sourced probably over 50 or talked
to over 50 cultivators worldwide to source
[SPEAKER_01]: our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not vertically integrated,
but we work with the best in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the best approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and we found a partner that is
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis under all the regulations
up to our quality standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without chemical pesticides and in
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's from the European Union.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you see then one of the next kind of
lead ons that there is a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are going to focus on the
price per gram and it's going to be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Latin American countries or in
Africa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the farming ability in Europe,
which is far more advanced than most
[SPEAKER_00]: territories in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that being a leg up for Europe
from being able to supply the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: content of Europe with Europe grown
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you always see that there's going to
be a balance of the supply chain coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into Europe from far off countries and
grown locally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think there are two aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, importing from within the
European Union to Germany, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: is much easier than doing it from from
third party countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the regulatory aspect is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, we see a lot of cultivation
right now, a lot of cultivators entering
[SPEAKER_01]: the market with high quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see that the European Union probably
could satisfy the demand here within the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, other countries with
preferable cultivation conditions like
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa, South America will also have good
products, probably with a lower price that
[SPEAKER_01]: will enter the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the regulation regarding
certification, it's much more demanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be EU GMP certified in order
to export to the European Union or to
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not everyone is meeting the demand yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Covid might also be a reason during Covid,
less inspections have been conducted all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this might delay it a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, other cultivators from
other countries will enter the market as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I see as well that I was reading
recently that some of the first grown
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grown in Germany has hit the
German market via pharmacy, some grown by
[SPEAKER_00]: Aurora and one of the other comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty good milestone to be
able to say that we've got our own flower
[SPEAKER_00]: on our own shelves for our own consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Europe could end up going
that direction that certain countries are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have certain genetics and strains
that are relative to maybe, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the diseases or the patients that they're
aiming to treat in each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I think America is going to focus
more on just it would be weed to get high
[SPEAKER_00]: and weed as a commercial adult use
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I think Europe you could have a
far more nuanced industry with individual
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of brings me on to the next topic I
wanted to talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Germany good for cannabis startups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see this being one of the hubs?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked to the Malta Enterprise Board
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked to, we know Ireland is one of
the main homes for a lot of the big,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge global companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think Germany is going to be a hub
for some of the cannabis startups in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as you mentioned, we have the first
German cannabis on the market now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is a pretty big milestone
for the whole industry, the European
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and Germany being the biggest
market in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, I think, yes, it's a good
place for cannabis startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there are two aspects to
consider here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have the medical side,
the patients, the physicians, and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: many more patients in Germany than
physicians who prescribe cannabis as a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, cannabis and the endo
cannabinoid system are rarely part of
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical medical education.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we need to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we support physicians and pharmacists
through medical education.
[SPEAKER_01]: We offer workshops and an online platform
that offers education on that end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other part is the regulatory side,
getting all the pharmaceutical licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a narcotics license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a distribution license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the manufacturing license in
order to build important steps here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and bring the best products to our
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market is therefore really complex
with high entry barriers, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously good for the companies that are
already in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see Germany as a really potential
market here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at the German market,
it's the biggest one in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the numbers of it,
in 2020, I think more than 128,000
[SPEAKER_01]: patients were treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, when it was legalized,
there were only 27,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to prohibition partners,
more than one million German patients will
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to medical cannabis by 2024,
which is a huge step in development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medical cannabis market alone,
I think, is expected to be worth around
[SPEAKER_01]: 7.7 billion by 2028.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we will see great development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the German and European market has
great potential, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany is going to be the model
for Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens there is going to be
distributed across the continent just for,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, size of market, the skilled
labor workforce there that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: products are going to be to the highest of
global standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's exciting times to be in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys recently listed the Berlin
and Hamburg stock exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the plans for the next 12 to 24
months that you'd like to tick off your
[SPEAKER_00]: dream cannabis list of give me two items
to tick off in the next 12 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I mean, one big milestone was
listing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned right now, we got first
listed in Dusseldorf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a huge milestone we've been
working on for a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, we have a lot more future
plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to bring our own sustainable
brand into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be the next big step and huge
milestone for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, we see ourselves not just
as a German Berlin company, but as a
[SPEAKER_01]: European company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, we are looking into different
markets as well and really looking closely
[SPEAKER_01]: on the developments there and probably
will be soon in other markets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we look forward to seeing your
products over in Ireland for anybody wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn more about cannabis, you can
check out the website down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can get the chat before the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we get to meet in person at one
of the conferences that are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a great day and thank you very
much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure and hope to talk to you
soon.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
