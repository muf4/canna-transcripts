[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Adria G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry, who's the Director at the Oklahoma
Medical Marijuana Authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Adria?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma is one of those states that has a
lot of action going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to learn from the most
important people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you ended up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma Medical Marijuana and your
position there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was appointed to this position August of
2021, so it's been almost two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took the job at the request of the
governor of Oklahoma, Governor Kevin
[SPEAKER_01]: Stitt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me to come in and see what was
going on, see what needed to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, our department was under a
larger agency, the State Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are actually a standalone agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislature moved us over and we are
now our own state agency who our entire
[SPEAKER_01]: job is to regulate and license the medical
marijuana industry and patients in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked to one of your residents there,
really a business intelligence
[SPEAKER_00]: businessman, who gave us a quick little
overview of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of wanted to start at the first
topic of implementation versus impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has everything that's been that they aim
to implement been implemented?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there things that got left off the
licensing and what's been the impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest impact of the laws that have
happened in Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think if you're asking about
implementation, do you mean the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: voted to legalize in Oklahoma in 2018?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the laws, I'm sure at some
stage, a set of politicians had to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: down and go, OK, how are we going to
implement this in the state of Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_00]: State by state seems to be so varied and
so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the impact been what the people who
are the ladies and men who have
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented the laws been what they had
hoped for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or has there been some lag in certain
areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there have been, well, lots of
differing opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when State Question 788, it was a
petition written by citizens of Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what legalized medical marijuana in
Oklahoma, as I'm sure you've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happened in June of 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who wrote that and voted on
that voted for a very free market approach
[SPEAKER_01]: to the medical marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have any there were no caps
on the number of plants that can be grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no limit on the size of a grow,
a cultivative cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no limit on the number of
commercial licenses that we can grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No limit on the number of patient
licenses, no qualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can tell from what I'm saying,
it was a very free market, free approach
[SPEAKER_01]: to medical marijuana, one that hasn't been
done in any other state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Oklahoma has been the kind of the test
case for how the free market works and
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the session, the legislative session
after that state question passed,
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislature did come in and wrote some
laws to put a little bit of a regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: framework around the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if you ask how the
implementation was intended versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: impact, I believe that all of the parties
involved would say there were definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: unforeseen consequences of the way that
the free market approach worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is that the very low there's
a very low barrier to entry into our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, which is not by itself ever a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what has happened in Oklahoma is that
even the criminal organizations are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting an OMMA license or were getting an
OMMA license.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found ways to get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they look on the surface like
they're legitimate, but they are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: not legitimate businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happened is we are now forced to
distinguish who is a legitimate business
[SPEAKER_01]: owner versus who is a criminal actor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes up a lot of our time here
at the regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the implementation versus the impact,
I would say there were definitely some
[SPEAKER_01]: unforeseen circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to Oklahoma,
excuse me, is it a blue or red state?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very red state.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it's it's great to see that there
was such an open platform to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like with everything, when you open
the gates is always going to be a few
[SPEAKER_00]: little things that you need to tidy up
once the gate have been opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the regulatory framework,
the more permissive license approach that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys had, as you said, there's some
nefarious actors getting into the market
[SPEAKER_00]: that you didn't necessarily want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there software or is there now a
separate agency within your department
[SPEAKER_00]: that literally look after due diligence
for business owners and ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody meets the high standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to implement sea to sail
tracking last May.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been exactly one year that has
helped us tremendously by helping our
[SPEAKER_01]: inspectors who go out into the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do their research on our sea to sail
tracking system before they go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: compare the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes you're going to find that
the criminal actors or people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get around the the rules are not
utilizing the sea to sail tracking system
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just one way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way that we are identifying the
bad actors or the criminal actors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is on the front end, on the
licensing end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've built up a an investigative unit
within our licensing department that digs
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into license applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know a little more what to look for
now to see if they are trying to if these
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal organizations are trying to get
into the legitimate industry and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing our due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting a stringent read on every single
commercial license application.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first couple of years of the program,
that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a country, let's say like Ireland
over here in Europe, who looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization is coming around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be made the two things that you
would recommend politicians and lawmakers
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that that is a part and a core part
of any industry from your previous
[SPEAKER_00]: experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely recommend that you have
a quality sea to sail tracking system
[SPEAKER_01]: before you ever start allowing
cultivation, processing and selling of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whether it's medicinal or adult
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason there is not because I'm
thinking of it as an illegal product
[SPEAKER_01]: turned legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of it as a product that at
the end of the day, a consumer or a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient is going to inhale into their
lungs or apply to their skin or consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to know that that is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once cannabis becomes regulated in a
country or a state, that is exactly the
[SPEAKER_01]: expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a patient or a consumer goes into a
dispensary, I want to be able to say with
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence to them that they can trust the
products they're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way they can do that is if we
are tracking it, making sure that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: tested properly and we are doing our due
diligence to ensure that it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that has been sold on the illicit
market and gotten to their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, sea to sail
tracking is incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing that I would say is just
making sure you have the correct to
[SPEAKER_01]: lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say make sure you're talking with
people in the industry and talking with
[SPEAKER_01]: patients so that you're not making laws
without their input, because this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very complex plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so much to know about cannabis
regulation, and you've got to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: experts, whether they're industry,
patients, scientists, physicians,
[SPEAKER_01]: consult with all of them to make sure that
you're ahead of a lot of the technology
[SPEAKER_01]: and innovation that's happening with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a thing over here in Ireland
happening at the moment called a citizens
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly, and they're generally gathered
when there's got to be a new change in
[SPEAKER_00]: laws, whether it's gay marriage or
abortion rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now got one for drugs that seems to
be going very positively, and they seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: have done a number of things that you
recommended there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still dealing with some of the,
let's say we'll call it misinformation
[SPEAKER_00]: from specific either medical professionals
or outside medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that still continue in Oklahoma as
much as your industry has been a success
[SPEAKER_00]: or does it dumb down once the industry
gets going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems to come from misinformed
and completely out of sync information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that is something that I think is
going to take years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And years and years, and it's just going
to take a cultural shift and that takes
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even though we have such a large
industry, a lot of the Oklahomans who
[SPEAKER_01]: voted yes to legalize medical marijuana
did so because they thought, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, this is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will help someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to vote yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What ended up happening in the more rural
parts of our state, some of these bad
[SPEAKER_01]: actors and criminal organizations moved in
and created and built these gigantic
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took all the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is a finite, precious resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Oklahoma, it is an emotional thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are very protective of their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these cannabis farmers were
not being good neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's put a really bad taste in a lot
of Oklahomans' mouths, especially in rural
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've been following, we had a
petition on the ballot for adult use,
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational cannabis use back in
November, no, back in March, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It failed by a pretty big margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe it's from what I'm saying to
you that the people who thought that
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal marijuana was just was to be
helpful have unfortunately seen kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bad sides of the industry in Oklahoma
and don't want any more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gone a little bit backwards on
that culture war as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation is kind of the bottom line
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very interesting, as you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's such an easy entry point into
this market that anybody can get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem to see that across the world in
cannabis that anybody with a bit of money
[SPEAKER_00]: can get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then realize once the industry is up
and running that, OK, we need real players
[SPEAKER_00]: in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to set boundaries and licenses and
all the variables that are going to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that if it was the cocoa market or whether
it was the vanilla market that they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated to the same standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next, last topic, I'm going to let you
go in a couple of minutes because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a very busy lady and patient care
and education when it comes to Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this widespread across the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there specific private entity
companies that take care of patient care
[SPEAKER_00]: and education?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a is it a capital mark where anybody
can open a private clinic, have my own
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have the patients everything
up and running or are there certain
[SPEAKER_00]: frameworks that are in place to hinder
patient access?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty free market, just like
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding in Oklahoma that
goes back to what you were just talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about is that the physicians in Oklahoma
have been resistant to learning more about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and recommending cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times they might recommend for
a patient to get their patient card,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they don't really have the
education or the knowledge to recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: dosage or type of consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what has happened is some groups have
popped up that are not physicians that are
[SPEAKER_01]: more patient educators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been able to create their own
lane on educating patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's a lot of room to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working as the regulatory agency
to try to put together some materials for
[SPEAKER_01]: patients based on science and medical
knowledge and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still limited here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I'm sure you know that from
everyone you've spoken to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, people like Dr. Grinspoon,
who are physicians who have done the
[SPEAKER_01]: research and do know the efficacy of it,
are helpful to all of us because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to point and say, look, there are
physicians that have done this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oklahoma, they're a little bit
resistant still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patient education and care is really
something that needs improvement here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be the same way I think
across every state and every country that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to that the current doctors
are of a specific age and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily make sense that we hope that
the new wave of doctors coming through or
[SPEAKER_00]: actually learn about the ECS and all of
the various dosage and ratios and profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: and even terpene benefits that they can
start formulating good individual size
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines as opposed to there's a one size
fits all model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to Oklahoma over the
next coming years, what is your biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: your top two things that you want to see
get enacted in Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for us, we just want to do our job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a part of what the past couple of
years have been since I came here was just
[SPEAKER_01]: building the staff, training the staff to
make sure that we're actually out and
[SPEAKER_01]: checking in with businesses, doing
compliance inspections, paying attention
[SPEAKER_01]: on the front end to these licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see us working like a well-oiled
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still a little clunky because we're
still in a lot of our departments in
[SPEAKER_01]: training mode learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time to learn all of our rules
and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the goal for a year from now for
us to be running like a well-oiled machine
[SPEAKER_01]: with transparency towards the industry and
patients where they know exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to we try to make sure they
always know what we're doing as the
[SPEAKER_01]: government body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not ever trying to hide the ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them to know what to expect from
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that and then we are starting up our
own quality assurance lab and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to partner with our Department of
Agriculture to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the reason we're partnering
with them is because of the current
[SPEAKER_01]: insurgence of the hemp derived
cannabinoids that we're seeing all across
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the world, but definitely across
the United States that are largely
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, HHC and Delta A are all over Europe
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it seems to me they're making up
a huge chunk of the actual sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the size of the market in Oklahoma
on an annual basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that number off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually just we have some data on
our NCS dashboard that might be helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't I don't have it off the top of
my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to talk a lot at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy person and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the start of the day over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got lots to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to take take up more of your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic talking, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully when Ireland starts getting some
movement and regulations, we can touch
[SPEAKER_00]: base which again and see what we can learn
in Europe from all the excellent work you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are doing in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
