[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the cannabis review I'm delighted to be
[SPEAKER_01]: joined in this episode by Lucas hurt who's
the publisher and editor-in-chief of
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine canopy and the Publisher of
cannabis therapy magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey keep it today Lucas Very good Owen and
thank you for having me on your show I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: delighted to have you on so the Chepra
Republic are making a lot of waves in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe I thought who better to get on than
a man Who's gonna have inside information
[SPEAKER_01]: on all the various topics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true so can you maybe give
everybody a quick overview about your your
[SPEAKER_01]: publications that you have canopy and Your
other magazine and then we can jump into
[SPEAKER_00]: the Czech Republic topic Okay,
so very briefly I'm publishing canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine which is which is a bi-monthly
magazine in the Czech Republic it's we
[SPEAKER_00]: print around 10,000 copies every two
months and it's being sold all around the
[SPEAKER_00]: Czech Republic and also in Slovakia and
apart from that we started a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago also a English online version
called cannabis therapy magazine and we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to publish them the articles which
are interesting for international audience
[SPEAKER_00]: in English there as well and currently we
are also working on some kind of automatic
[SPEAKER_00]: translations into into other other
languages so that we can you know have
[SPEAKER_00]: more broader audience even from some
non-english-speaking countries such as
[SPEAKER_00]: like Spanish or French or German and stuff
like that and basically the magazine is
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on medical medical aspect of
Cannabis, but also we we take up the topic
[SPEAKER_00]: of the recreational legalization because
it's being discussed here in the Czech
[SPEAKER_00]: Republic more and more and Time I'm sure
that that's the most the thing which
[SPEAKER_01]: interests you most Yeah, well,
it's you start hearing the dimension of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Chepra public a lot over the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say six to twelve months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all German Up until the last six to
twelve months and it seems to be you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming up on the inside lane very fast
Can you answer me this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the cause of the the positive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Discussions that are happening in the
Czech Republic around legalization of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis now What was the first kind of
the influx point where everybody started
[SPEAKER_01]: to change their tone?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically the last parliamentary
election when you got the new government
[SPEAKER_00]: and this new government is like
pro-european pro-western and kind of Like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like conservative party, which is
which is on the top, but this conservative
[SPEAKER_00]: party or actually the prime minister who
is from the conservative party his name is
[SPEAKER_00]: Petr Fiala and He has a very good friend
our former national drug coordinator
[SPEAKER_00]: Indřich Vobořil and this Indřich Vobořil
is pretty world-renowned drug expert on
[SPEAKER_00]: drug addiction and drug policies and He
was our national drug coordinator for
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years, but the previous government
they just threw him out because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: interested In harm reduction policies and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wanted to continue the
prohibition But the new prime minister
[SPEAKER_00]: last year when the election was over and
the new government was formed the new
[SPEAKER_00]: prime minister Petr Fiala, he just Took
him back and since he's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just he's working very hard on this We
call it like a harm reduction policies
[SPEAKER_00]: which want to focus on basic human rights
and what better place to start is than the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because you know with cannabis in
the Czech Republic we have The general
[SPEAKER_00]: public has a very good relationship with
it like for past 20 years The general
[SPEAKER_00]: attitude was very positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have nothing against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we are very open-minded society
very liberal, but the laws and the
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecution from police and from the
Justice system was always there like in
[SPEAKER_00]: other European countries So we have many
people who are in jail only for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and using cannabis for their own purposes
without even selling it selling it and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some very like exemplary cases
of people who didn't do anything didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: harm anybody else and they end up like
young people and they end up in jail for
[SPEAKER_00]: five or more years, so We want to change
that and under this leadership of Inřich
[SPEAKER_00]: Obořil who has the blessing from the prime
minister to do this we are just working on
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulation bill which would Which
would stand on three pillars one pillar is
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing home growing for your own
purposes It should be allowed to anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's over 18 years old and then the
second pillar is existence of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: social clubs And the third pillar is
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously in terms of international
laws and single conventions and the EU law
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest obstacle will be with the
regulated market and this is taking up the
[SPEAKER_00]: most of our time I mean our time the
people who work on this because I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: member of several subgroups who are
working on this under the umbrella of
[SPEAKER_00]: national drug coordinator and the
government offices, so we have like five
[SPEAKER_00]: subgroups and these subgroups are trying
to prepare the the draft of the law and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the expert group which is on the top
of these five subgroups will be presenting
[SPEAKER_00]: the draft of the law to the politicians to
the parliament and the legislative process
[SPEAKER_00]: will begin so Basically, yeah,
that's what that's what happened and the
[SPEAKER_00]: main the main drive behind this It's
definitely the personality of Inřich
[SPEAKER_00]: Obořil who put his like credibility his
knowledge and everything behind it he put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into this effort and he's leading the
effort and he gathered many experts from
[SPEAKER_00]: the drug policy field also with we are in
talks with the police and with the lawyers
[SPEAKER_00]: and also obviously with people from
various ministries like Ministry of Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Foreign Ministry Interior Ministry,
so it's it's a hard effort and it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of time and lots of work,
but hopefully we'll be able to to prepare
[SPEAKER_00]: something which will be which will be okay
for the politicians for the for the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians in the parliament the MPs and
then in the Senate and if this this law
[SPEAKER_00]: passes we should be able to legalize
somehow in like next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully 2024 should be the year Very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me the subgroups and the
expert groups that you talked about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific division in in
government or a specific person in
[SPEAKER_01]: government who was in charge of setting up
those subgroups?
[SPEAKER_01]: and expert groups or is it a multitude of
different departments?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multitude of different departments,
but basically who was deciding who will be
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on each subgroups is people from
Inřich Obořil's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all under him and he has some
people working for him who are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: like administering administering this
agenda because he has you know many stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so he has people working for him,
but generally it's not like that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like one ministry which would be
overlooking all it's like this it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the offices of the government
where Inřich Obořil works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in every subgroups, there is someone
from Ministry of Health from Ministry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some national anti-drug police
force.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people from the custom offices
and they are they have their
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives in each of the subgroups
and the subgroups are divided
[SPEAKER_00]: thematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of them is international law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is home law and like laws in
the Czech Republic and the prohibition and
[SPEAKER_00]: the repression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one is economy and taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total there are five of them and I'm
a member of two of them, but I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the work of the other three as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far I can't say anything openly and
in public because it's all like behind
[SPEAKER_00]: closed doors at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first public announcement should be by
the end of March.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, end of March.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of working in unison with
your neighbors Germany, do you believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that the two political leaders of each
country have had discussions on this and
[SPEAKER_01]: are kind of moving in unison or do you
think they're on two different
[SPEAKER_01]: trajectories that it just seems it might
look as if they're working together,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it seems as if Czech Republic are
going a hell of a lot faster than Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely there are talks between not the
politicians, but between the officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the team of Inřich Obořil is in close
talks with their counterparts in German
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the German drug experts who are
working on the bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to like discuss our next
steps and try to be in line because we
[SPEAKER_00]: also have a long shared border.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we need to discuss the
things, you know, if one legalizes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would happen because you have the
free of trade, free of trade, free trade
[SPEAKER_00]: in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's like lots of things to
be discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in close touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me personally, but people from our
team, from Inřich Obořil team are in close
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with them and they are trying to,
you know, make the same steps or similar
[SPEAKER_00]: steps in order to be in line somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that the end result that
they're going to get is going to basically
[SPEAKER_01]: be a change of European law or just we're
moving on ahead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems that if you guys about
Germany and Czech Republic legalize,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems to it's going to obviously be a
domino effect then that no country is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want to have a border with a
country with a legal industry where their
[SPEAKER_01]: citizens can just walk over and buy what
they want and then walk back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's the biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are just talking about this a lot
because, you know, everybody is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: scared of this single convention and the
UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, nothing can happen if we
don't, you know, if we don't listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: this UN single convention anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is European law,
because if the European Union or the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Commission says you shouldn't be
doing this and we will do it anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could punish us somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and nobody wants to be in like,
you know, have problems with the European
[SPEAKER_00]: Commission and the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the biggest problem now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the biggest threat to this effort
is that the European Commission will say,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, we are against it and you cannot do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously, the Czech Republic is
a small player.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would need the help from German
government to try to not I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: force, but to try to persuade the European
Commission and the people in there
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for this decision to allow it
at least somehow or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it will end up that they will say,
you know, you can legalize it for the home
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, because it's like human rights
issue, because you shouldn't be putting
[SPEAKER_00]: people behind bars because of growing few
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the regulated market could be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still waiting what the European
Commission says.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, there was just some indication,
but nothing official.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in the Czech Republic and in
Germany, the proponents of this
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization efforts are waiting and
expecting what's going to come out from
[SPEAKER_00]: the European Commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they say no, it's going to be a
huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a team or a specific person in
the European Commission that is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the sole arbiter of this case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it going to be a panel of people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't know, because I'm
actually not the member of the subgroup
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this international
international relationship and
[SPEAKER_00]: international laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have the information from this
group yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have them, as I said, at the end of
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, I'm just focused on my two
groups and I'm following the news from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other groups as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other groups as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know how this is like in
regarding the European Commission,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm not doing this like in very
depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, something I wanted to ask you about,
what is the manifest in Prague?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the top event that you guys have
every year in the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it grew from a small minor trade
show to one of the biggest and largest
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis trade shows and exports in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably it's the second biggest
to go to Las Vegas and maybe to Spanabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's comparable to Spanabis, but
definitely it's hugely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many people even from other
countries coming here for this trade show,
[SPEAKER_00]: like from Germany, from Poland and
Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovakia and other countries which have
pretty strict cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come to Prague every November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very good that the main organizer
of the Cannabis Fest, he doesn't just do
[SPEAKER_00]: the trade show, but he always organizes a
professional conference which is attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to the trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are always very important
figures of the cannabis world from
[SPEAKER_00]: science, from politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many patients there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really great that if people come
to visit Cannabis, they just don't see the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and they don't just buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, like flower pots and seeds
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can also attend this professional
conference and see the important people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are doing research for many years and
who are very knowledgeable in the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to give their talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like it's a lot of education as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's on every November for everybody
that's watching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's always the first weekend in
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like around 30,000 people coming
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me this, before we go,
you've got your first edition of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Magazine coming out this Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tell everybody a little bit
about what's going to be in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: article and what people can expect from
the magazine moving forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like the first issue of this
year because we've been on the market for
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly five years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be the first issue of
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously we focus mainly,
as I said in the beginning, originally the
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine was focused on medical aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because what's happening in the Czech
Republic, as we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: we focus more and more on the politics and
on the regulation, upcoming regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a large interview with one
famous rapper from the Czech Republic who
[SPEAKER_00]: established a chart, he calls it the chart
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tries to speak with the politicians
who are actually against this
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, which is mainly the
Christian conservatives, like in every
[SPEAKER_00]: other country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the extremists from the right
side of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the medical aspects, we are just
talking about health problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: women's health problems and how cannabis
can help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main topic of the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, as in every issue, we have many
patient stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have growing articles about growing
because we want to encourage people to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow their own medicine at home as well,
of course, in a legal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are talking the CBD strains with up
to 1% THC, which is also a very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting development here that since
since 2022, we have 1% THC legalized in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are the only European Union country
to allow this and only second in the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this contributed also a lot to the
cannabis boom in the Czech Republic
[SPEAKER_00]: because the more THC you can have in the
plant, the richer profile you can have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the CBD product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we have one hundred pages,
so lots of interesting stuff to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope to be able to translate as
much as we can to English and then
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully to other languages as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic talking to you, Lucas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you guys nothing but the best in
the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can touch base again this
year and see how things are moving along
[SPEAKER_01]: steadily and all the best with all the
subs group and experts groups that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it will be my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
