[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined in this
episode by Pete Patterson, who's the CEO
[SPEAKER_01]: of Valcon Medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking all things
Danish cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pete, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking forward to getting
somebody on from Denmark to discuss the
[SPEAKER_01]: overview of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going through the different
countries throughout Europe, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: piecing together the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great to chat with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of give everybody an overview
of how you got into the industry and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to CEO of Valcon Medical real
quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for myself, I've been in the industry
since 2012, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got started by founding one of Canada's
first private equity funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got that up and going with some capital,
deployed some capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still very early days when just
even talking about cannabis when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: on restaurants or anything like that was a
taboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it was challenging, but a lot of
fun at the same instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went on to found a company called Vitalis
Extraction Technology and then
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently sold that a number of years
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then found myself over here in Europe
making a number of investments here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is Valcon Medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that organization was founded in
late 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've come over from Canada just to add
some of that cannabis experience and just
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that everybody on the team is
on the right track, which they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a wealth of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of give everybody cannabis in
Denmark at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I can see of the reading I've
done so far, you had the four year plan
[SPEAKER_01]: extended there just recently in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doctors can prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients can have access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies can license and export it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've recently found that there was a
Danish grown product for sale in Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not available for Danish consumers as
of yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a rule and regulation that
hinders this or what would be the case to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we start to take a look at the
products that are available in Denmark
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, there's four.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three flowers that have been
introduced by Bedriken and then a capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: that's introduced by Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it stands right now, there are no other
products that have been introduced into
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark by Danish companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for lack of trying and it's not
for lack of the regulatory bodies wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow it or accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look at your major cultivators such
as like say Aurora, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, Canopy's facility,
which is now owned by Little Green Pharma,
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll Medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these organizations have a flower
within the product approval pipeline and
[SPEAKER_00]: just going through the checks and balances
to make sure that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: available and acceptable to the Danish
government and then therefore to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Danish patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say just because they have market
authorization in Germany doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're automatically going to get it here
in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations or the bars are probably
one of the most or the most stringent that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to see in Europe from a
quality perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so again, it's the kind of barrier to
entry for the products there is just so
[SPEAKER_01]: high and the regulations are so strict.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just thinking EUGMP was the
strictest of them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's not just EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's EUGMP, which is going to set
your guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, however, and these companies are
all cultivating at incredible quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really going through the time that it
takes for the stability testing and then
[SPEAKER_00]: alongside of that, making sure that
they're doing all of the microbial potency
[SPEAKER_00]: testing through that time and period just
to make sure that those products meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: standards that the Danish medical system
is going to be requiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, when you're taking a look
at flower, just in its rough form,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a complex product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microbials that can be,
I guess, housed in this product are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably of the greatest concern to the
Danish Medicines Agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not taking a look at accelerated
stability or anything along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking a look at, you know,
what's happening on a month to month basis
[SPEAKER_00]: in these true long stability studies just
to make sure that this product is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be safe for the for the end patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I was reading up about Professor
Anna Katharina over there working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Danish Institute of Medical or
Technological Institute doing some work on
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue cultures and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to be the Denmark is lining
itself up to have all the eyes dotted and
[SPEAKER_01]: the T's crossed to have this made in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked to the Maltese guys already,
but you seem to be going for a made in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark is going to be the seal of
approval, you reckon, from the products
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see a lot of organizations
bringing in product into Europe from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing that the rest of the
world can expect from Denmark,
[SPEAKER_00]: as they have with any other product that
comes out of Denmark, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consistency is going to be there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is absolutely necessary for the
pharmaceutical and medicinal worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make sure that we're creating
the same thing over and over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that's being very,
very closely watched here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exact dosage when it comes to the medical
industry has to be down to the minute zero
[SPEAKER_01]: point zero milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we move on to the next part,
which is the Vulcan medical store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave us a quick overview .
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain to us why the Danish
industry, what the opportunity is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see Denmark having a step above
the likes of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I see Ireland and Malta being
processing facilities for a large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: product being turned into pharmaceutical
products and then being shipped into the
[SPEAKER_01]: European pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see Denmark having an upper step on
the two territories I just mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where I see the the exciting
components of Denmark and maybe taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we we evaluated from an investment
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should we set up a facility at the
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark was one of the first countries
that were allowing for the processing and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a number of organizations that
were getting set up to do cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked at the regulatory
framework where there were no caps on how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you could cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no caps on how much you could
export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a it was a very nice and
straightforward regulatory framework,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we appreciated coming out of the
Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many years we spent
working with organizations and watching
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations saying, oh, we'll be
licensed next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be licensed next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two years later, they're still
waiting on their licensing because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of transparency in that licensing
process, unfortunately, and the and the
[SPEAKER_00]: changing of the benchmarks, you might say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus Denmark, it's been very,
very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of getting a license,
it's not easy to get a license here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very clear on what's required to
be able to get a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw that as a major benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondarily, in terms of why Denmark
Denmark, I'd say probably about 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of their GDP comes out of the
pharmaceutical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of professionals here
that are used to working in the not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space, but in the pharmaceutical
space with transferable skills to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I've seen some of the other other
markets where they don't have that access
[SPEAKER_00]: to that professional labor pool,
that can make a big impact in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reliability of the organization and the
organization's ability to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a look at Malta, taking a look at
Ireland, both great spots, even from a tax
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, both great spots to be able
to start a production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got you can see Northern
Leaf they're getting going over there in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey, for example.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, you know, our friends at
Materia that got a facility set up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those are places that we took a
look at, even Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was regulatory framework that really
made a huge difference for us to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, is this a very straightforward
regulatory framework?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just something that we can act
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we were founded or we
founded this organization late 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's taken us this long to be able
to get through the fundraising processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the build out, then the licensing and
validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes it takes a very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Denmark at the time was was great for
it and still has been an exceptional place
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to do business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good business partner is a hugely
important thing when you're setting up in
[SPEAKER_01]: a different territory, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last topic of conversation, and I think
you're going to have a wealth of knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: on this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian LPs, are we going to see one of
them go and bust this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it is as big a shitshow as I can see
from over here in Ireland or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're going to pull out of the bag
that for some reason to make this billions
[SPEAKER_01]: of dollars of investment worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought Hexa were on turning their
corner and they seem to be going the other
[SPEAKER_01]: way completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can see three to four of those guys
rolling low on capital and who on earth is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to keep funding unless it's a
current investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you see as the next 12 to 24
months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see some merger and acquisitions
there where there's left with like two
[SPEAKER_01]: players and kind of they're they're
they're able to survive on a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: leaner strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you see the next 12 or 24
months happening over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's anybody's guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canadian LPs have done a phenomenal
job at driving capital into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada having the stock exchanges
available between the Canadian stock
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange, which has been, I guess,
jokingly noted as the cannabis stock
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange or the CSE, and then on top of
that with the TSX.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of organizations going public,
lots of access to capital and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional hype that brought in a ton of
capital to the market to bring capital
[SPEAKER_00]: into that market for a company to say,
hey, look, we're going to play it safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to build a 20,000 square feet
and kind of grow with the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't drive as much excitement as,
hey, we're going to build a facility that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see from space, which we heard one
of the founders at one point say at a
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was definitely a
different components, different strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: to what the end objective was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're seeing right now is a
lot more of a pragmatic approach within
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian cannabis industry and also
that echoing throughout the global
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas organizations are not saying,
hey, we're going to be everything and
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to anybody and everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we can do to try to grow
this company profitably.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing, you know, liquidity
challenges with a number of these spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not without, you know, some of these
organizations are still strong assets on
[SPEAKER_00]: their balance sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they have that strong assets,
it's really trying to commercialize those
[SPEAKER_00]: assets and figure out, okay, what can we
do with these to turn a profit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see Canopy trimming down quite
dramatically, Aurora doing the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and really just right sizing their
business because the industry isn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's growing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing quite fast, but it's not
growing as fast as they were maybe once
[SPEAKER_00]: previously expecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll still be a dominant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be gigantic, but it takes
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took time in Canada and it takes even
more time over here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we're actually going to
see is, yeah, some more consolidation
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, but also more specialization
rather than companies saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, we're going to own all the products
and do all the testing and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and all the extraction and all
the everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're spreading out your dollars so
thin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're spreading out your expertise so
thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at most industries
globally, outside of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, they don't operate like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Apple, Apple who sat down with
everything end to end, they have groups
[SPEAKER_00]: that manufacture products for them and
groups that will specialize across that
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're going to start to
see more and more of that today in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space where we're going to see
that specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at it over here in
Europe and just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a group to go and spend, you know,
three to five million euros on setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: their own extraction facility to put out
maybe 4,000, 5,000 bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the regulatory changes
might cause them to repivot, have to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: up some more capital assets and then
deploy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it takes, you know, 24 to 36
months to build out and then even before
[SPEAKER_00]: you're bringing a new product to market,
just building out and getting qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long time and a lot can change
during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think specialization is definitely
the path to the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last word before we go, we know
medical is going to be dominant in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: for the next few years, but do you see
there being a dispensary style model at
[SPEAKER_01]: some stage in Europe to copy the kind of
American model?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Canadians started with a mail-in,
a mail-in medical cannabis program,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you could pick up your orders online
and have them delivered to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus Europe, we already see a physical
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that step to dispensary model,
once a recreational program comes into
[SPEAKER_00]: play, I don't think that's so far ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already in existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a distribution platform already in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so stepping into maybe something a
little bit more recreation once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, I do see that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've started to see now a lot of with the
passing of European commission and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: sell CBD flour now legally in the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen a huge influx of CBD flour
being sold at a good price, same as CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know of a couple of stores open up
in Austria and France where they'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: selling CBD flour and CBD hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that'll be a quick turnaround
just to be able to add THC into their
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an exciting industry and a lot to
look forward to over the next coming
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for coming on the
show, Pete.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a time limit of 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just coming up to that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we'll get to talk again in the
future about the Danish industry and how
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me on for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shall talk to you again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Thank you.
