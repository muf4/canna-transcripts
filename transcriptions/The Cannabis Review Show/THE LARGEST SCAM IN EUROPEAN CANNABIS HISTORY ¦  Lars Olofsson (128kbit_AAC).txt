[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Lars Olufsen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lars has been a CEO and management
consultant for almost all of his 40 years
[SPEAKER_01]: in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an ex-Swedish Navy SEAL and he's
currently representing 500 people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Juicy Fields saga that's continuing to go
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lars, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good to have you on,
mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good to bring clarity and
information to the audience in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a lot of bullshit and
smoke and mirrors that are currently going
[SPEAKER_01]: on at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always great to get the information
straight from the sources, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
overview?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Juicy Fields for the people who
have no idea about it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Juicy Fields started in the spring of 2020
and basically it's an e-commerce platform
[SPEAKER_00]: where you could invest in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling it e-growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they have done is to pick from
different kinds of business concepts like
[SPEAKER_00]: a crowdfunding concept and an investment
concept and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was to put together a
concept where you're investing in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who are the main players who set up
Juicy Fields?
[SPEAKER_01]: What territory are they based in in the
world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's kind of interesting because
if you're looking at the website they have
[SPEAKER_00]: had, they said that they had operations
more or less all over the world in South
[SPEAKER_00]: America, in Central America, in Europe and
some farmers in Asia as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was from day one, a global
operation and then a global enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They presented a new way of investing in
the cannabis industry and that was the new
[SPEAKER_00]: disruptive concept, so to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the business model was basically
getting people to invest in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growers around the world and like a co-op
they'd all be able to spread their money
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell me how long did this
enterprise last?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well it's important to know that
there had been a pre-planning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least what I have identified is that
they have been working on this concept for
[SPEAKER_00]: at least two years before they started
operation in April 2020 and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: operation went on until mid-July this
year, 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more or less two years, two years and a
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was during the operation and when
they took in all the investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the company, there are different
companies but the parent company actually
[SPEAKER_00]: started back in 2017 as a kind of research
and development company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there had been quite a lot of planning
before they started operation and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of investments because that is very
important in this case because I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: just a lawyer, I'm also an investor in the
cannabis industry and I invest in startup
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could look at UC fields like a
startup company with all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of elements a startup company have to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A business concept, a business plan,
financing for starting up operation and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very interesting and where was the
let's say the parent company set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What location territory was that company
set up in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the parent company UC Grow is a
German company, UC Grow AD and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: started subsidiaries in Switzerland and
there is a potentially, it's a bit shady
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is a company in Cyprus but the
parent company is in Germany, that's for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay and how long have people been aware
of the UC fields scam and when did people
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of highlight that look, there's just
something not going correctly here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well there was definitely something
happen in the middle of July because all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden one day the website was closed
down, everything was shut down,
[SPEAKER_00]: emails was disconnected, mobile phones
were disconnected so more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight everything was closed down and
that's when people started to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: well what is this, is this just a
technical problem, is it just something
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary or have all the people just left
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first starting point of
the process, is this something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: still going on but there is something kind
of technical problems or is it a scam and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is interesting because I've been
investigating investment scam for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years and I've been involved in the
investigation and helping victims for more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 30 of these international investment
scams and I could see a pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: a kind of playbook that all these scammers
are using and one of the things they are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and this is smart because if you
shut down everything and disconnect
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, people realize that yes this
has been a scam but if you are leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: someone behind and posting things like
this in this situation, posting things on
[SPEAKER_00]: the website that yeah this is just a
temporary problem, we have had some
[SPEAKER_00]: internal conflicts between the founders of
a company, we are going to soon start up
[SPEAKER_00]: again and you are going to be able to
refund your investments and all these kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of information, then people are living on
the hope that yes I'm not being scammed
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is the psychology of these
scammers and they know this for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay very interesting and is there annual
returns for the companies or the liquidity
[SPEAKER_01]: of the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was the money outflowing to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a trail or a paperwork trail so
far?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked, this person took accident
there to the company, this person took
[SPEAKER_01]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the investors and I could tell you
that I have identified something about
[SPEAKER_00]: 125,000 investors for more or less all
countries all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was not just a European operation,
this was a global operation about 125,000
[SPEAKER_00]: and the business was done between the
investors and the Dutch company
[SPEAKER_00]: Juicyfields BV and Juicyfields BV they had
their account in Cyprus and so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where all the money was sent from the
investors to the Cyprus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Lithuanian bank also involved
but that was just a few percent of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cash flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main bulk of the cash flow was from
the investors to a bank in Cyprus and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bank account was hold by this Dutch
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting, there is a word going
around that it was basically just a very
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced money laundering scheme conducted
by the Russian mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any truth to that Neil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah definitely because in all this first
of all I should say that when I looked
[SPEAKER_00]: into this and I came into one of my
clients contacted me in the end of July
[SPEAKER_00]: and explained his situation and that was
one of my clients from Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should correct you that I have now about
800 clients from all over the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 50 countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I looked into this I saw immediately
the pattern, the kind of playbook,
[SPEAKER_00]: the template for these kinds of scams and
all the different elements and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: also very interesting because in all these
criminal activities the criminals also use
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of source of income.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very seldom just one kind of crime,
they are using this infrastructure they
[SPEAKER_00]: have built to use for different kind of
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the investment scam of having people
send money to Cyprus to invest in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants is just one of the different kind
of businesses or the different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal activities because inside the
use-you-feel scam I have identified all so
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of things that points in the
direction there had been a money
[SPEAKER_00]: laundering scheme as well and the money
laundering scheme could be three or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: four times as big as the investment scam
in size of the kind of money that was
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and I should also say that I have
identified something between 1.5 and 2
[SPEAKER_00]: billion euros has been lost by the
investors and I think the sum is closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 billion than 1.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific country that has the
most amount of investors that have lost
[SPEAKER_01]: the most amount of money or is it spread
out across the globe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting to see that the
numbers are very very uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the contact I have had and as I
said I have 800 clients but I've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact in one way or another,
me and my team, we are 12 people,
[SPEAKER_00]: being in contact with more than 20,000
investors and when I add up all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries and what I've been
talking to people and the information they
[SPEAKER_00]: have been giving me that's when I come up
with a number about 125,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is definitely one of the largest,
something between 10 and 11,000 investors
[SPEAKER_00]: has lost money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain is a very large country,
something nine, 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal, the neighboring country from
Spain, there is seven, 8,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of clients in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more than 60 clients in Mexico and
I think Mexico might be one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: countries actually and France as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands and thousands of
people in more or less every country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy the overarching reach of this
scam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have said previously that you're
sitting on documents that basically points
[SPEAKER_01]: the finger at certain facilitators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a case that some of these
facilitators were completely unaware of
[SPEAKER_01]: what was going on at the company or is
there actual factual evidence that would
[SPEAKER_01]: stand up in court that when the finger is
being pointed that there is irreverable
[SPEAKER_01]: proof that they were involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: My legal strategy, not in just this case
but in many other similar cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that I know for sure that the
criminals, they have been planning this
[SPEAKER_00]: for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been, as I said, a pre-planning
process of at least two years and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: operation during more than two years on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have planned this and invest a lot
of money and time into this and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: steal two billion euros, I could be 100%
sure that they had planned the exit as
[SPEAKER_00]: well to keep the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no logic in stealing two billion
euros and not trying to keep it as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: My strategy is, in all these cases,
not to go after the criminals because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are so far ahead and they had planned the
exit so carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more or less impossible to find the
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm doing in all these cases is to
look who helped them, who has facilitated
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to do the sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm targeting some of the large
social media companies, some media
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that have allowed use of fields
to actually promote, to do sales and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These companies cannot just say that we
didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to actually talk to people and
do some kind of due diligence of who they
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have asked two very simple
questions because everyone who is working
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cannabis industry, if you are a
farmer, if you are a producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are a trader, whatever it is,
you need to have a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who is handling cannabis in one
way or another need to have a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are giving investment advice or
managing people's money to get money and
[SPEAKER_00]: then put money into some kind of
investment, then you also need to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should have been two very simple
questions asked to the people from use a
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a license to trade in cannabis
and do you have a license to give
[SPEAKER_00]: investment advices or doing investment
management?
[SPEAKER_00]: And neither of these companies who I'm
calling facilitators has even asked any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these two basic questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's facilitators from everybody from
legal advice to conferences to media
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to news networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The onus was on them to ensure that they
were dealing with a reputable company and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially the facilitators who was in
the cannabis industry, those who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers, cannabis lawyers, those who have
done exhibitions within the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: business to business exhibitions,
all these people who actually have a
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of how the industry works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people I have identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a list of more than 40 companies
who has in one way or another been a
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitator for use your fields to do the
sales and promotion and exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, I have more than 70
people who has individuals who has in one
[SPEAKER_00]: way or another help use your fields with
sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are people who knows about the
cannabis industry and should have asked
[SPEAKER_00]: these two simple questions and how the
industry works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not just a matter of not
having the license.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole concept just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't this profit margin that is
promised to the investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot buy plants like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there isn't any end buyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the end buyers doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't sold one single flower to any
end buyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting case, to say the
least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you looking for reparations
basically from the facilitators to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: back any money that they were owed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it a case that these are going to
court and there's going to be a settlement
[SPEAKER_01]: brought against them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, more or less in 95% of these cases,
it's going to be a settlement outside
[SPEAKER_00]: court sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been trying to have a dialogue
with some of these large social media
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, but they had just ignored me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing now is to go to court
and I have a legal strategy and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: solid legal strategy and it's going to be
something very, very interesting from a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I would like to do is to set
precedent for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a facilitator, you just have to
do some basic due diligence of who you are
[SPEAKER_00]: working with and how you are facilitating
for these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is a damage, you have to take
responsibility for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not just claiming for the loss of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also claiming for the mental
discomfort that these people have had.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clients have lost so much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: On an average, my clients have lost more
than 32,000 euros.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people, all their investors,
they are not wealthy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they targeted was people who were
just ordinary people who wanted to support
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry and they wanted to
have the opportunity that the millionaires
[SPEAKER_00]: and the billionaires have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the kind of persona they set
target on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is ordinary people and many of the
investors have lost more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's one of those buyer beware for
every investor, retail investor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if I've been in this industry for
five years and I know of no company that's
[SPEAKER_01]: paying out 20 or 30x your investment to
date, even if you're based up in
[SPEAKER_01]: California or Colorado, you're still
looking at a small return on your
[SPEAKER_01]: investment until federal realisation
comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this industry, the cannabis
industry, the big return of investments
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in farming, as in all kind of
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if it's food or whatever
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very, very small profit margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So promising a profit margin of about 66%
within three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an annual return of investment of
about 250%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just so completely mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should have been a warning signal,
not just for the investors, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: investors, they had been scammed so
cleverly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the professionals, those that I'm
calling the facilitators, they should have
[SPEAKER_00]: realised this is an offer that just
doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no billion dollar farmers in
cannabis at the moment anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the only real returns from
this industry will be IP protected
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been absolutely amazing talking to
you, Lars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I get to touch base with you
maybe in about six months and we'll wait
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody to see how everything's
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's hope all the investors get some
of their return back for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you very much for taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who wants to know more about
the Juicy Fields case, they've built a
[SPEAKER_01]: website that has all the pertinent
information that you can go and peruse
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So highly recommend checking that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lars, thank you very much and you have a
great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, oh.
