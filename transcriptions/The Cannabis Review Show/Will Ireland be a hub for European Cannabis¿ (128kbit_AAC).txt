[SPEAKER_01]: that Ireland is going to be one of the
countries that delivers one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: global brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to maybe in this little
segment convince you as to why Ireland is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be the European hope for global
cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'd agree that a lot of the
investment opportunities and the M&A's
[SPEAKER_01]: that are happening, some of the London
Stock Exchange stuff is exciting industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of the North American
companies are definitely going to position
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves for a European entry at some
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a special place in my
heart for Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in India when I was eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually moved to Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents are doctors and they worked
there and I lived there for six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I was educated partly in
Ireland and then came to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say, you know, given where
Ireland has positioned itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only English speaking member right now
of the EU being known for its tax benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: to large corporations that have already
from other industries utilize it as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural, natural landing pad for
the larger companies, for innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: around this area, for brand creation,
for interaction between the US and the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I plan on making a business trip
out there and really getting a detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of what the opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you've already got a brand in
that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland already has a brand in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's all about how do you convert
that and how do you convince the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators to open up more business around
the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, by the way, is just a snowball
effect happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the US and you have any
kind of doubt about legalization in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US, just think of the fact that Canada and
Mexico are going to be legal federally and
[SPEAKER_00]: the US is going to be sitting there
missing out on tax revenue dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-COVID, everybody wants to address
deficits and any kind of new source of
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue generation is golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always, you know, people in the
industry complain that we get taxed too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a beautiful thing to get
taxed too much right now, because
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually, as the lobbying continues,
as we go towards legalization and beyond,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's then going to start looking at
tax efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ireland's going to be very much at the
nexus of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be a lot of the
services will be based in Ireland,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the kind of B2B business
operations will be based in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, there might be genetics in North
America, but I still think it'll make
[SPEAKER_01]: sense over time to have greenhouses set up
in Ireland, extraction facilities set up
[SPEAKER_01]: in Ireland, logistic companies set up in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's exciting future ahead for
Ireland and North America and Europe in
[SPEAKER_01]: the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we get to chat about this
again in the next few months when we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got things to progress about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your regulators in Ireland are
watching and they make a move in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, part of Bar Capital's work
is to promote and educate people and help
[SPEAKER_00]: find the right ways to open up this
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you, Nan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for coming on the show
and I hope you get to chat again very
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
Bye bye.
