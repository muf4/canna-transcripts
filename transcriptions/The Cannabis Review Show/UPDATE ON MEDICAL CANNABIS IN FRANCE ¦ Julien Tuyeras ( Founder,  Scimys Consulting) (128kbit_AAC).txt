[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Julien Touilleras, who's the founder at
[SPEAKER_01]: Schimi's leading consultancy firm based in
France.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Julien?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: First, glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello for your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super happy to present what we are
doing right now in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I will start for a short
presentation about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can hear, I'm French.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with 10 years experience in
cannabinoid, especially CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I discovered cannabinoid 10 years ago
in California, and I bring it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland, where I start my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was involved to seed to extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made our own extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we distribute this extract,
and we are the first one to do that in
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacy in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pharmacy is pharmacy Benu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a chain of pharmacy of 1500 pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after this Swiss experience,
I was focused on French market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm working on French market now since
two years as an advisor for my company,
[SPEAKER_00]: an advisor for pharmaceutical labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some are famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are less famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little quick explanation about my
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part, what I'm doing is to
advise to have good quality product,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is super important at the moment to
have a really good quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to choose raw materials,
producer, manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I advise, for example, about the law
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with marketing department or
scientific department as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to how to make promotion in pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a free, really free 60 service.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part, which is really crucial
for me, and I introduced that a bit later
[SPEAKER_00]: than the first part, it's to train
pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that training pharmacist,
it's really the key for CBD success,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially in pharmacy, because the
pharmacist miss a bit the train,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, compared to a CBD shop or other
sellers, and they are scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they realize that they have a lack of
knowledge at this moment, and they really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to increase their knowledge about CBD
product and especially about other counter
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will start to talk about the French
cannabis now market in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little quick update.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically an incredible career
you've had to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first topic that I wanted to talk to
you about was an update on medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you could maybe give everybody a
breakdown of what the size of the market
[SPEAKER_01]: is, where it's meant to be prescribed,
what conditions are included, and any
[SPEAKER_01]: other pertinent information that you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about French cannabis in France,
so the French medical cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after experimentation during three
years, pharmacy will be allowed next year
[SPEAKER_00]: for 2025 to deliver CBD product on
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will concern, for example,
like high CBD dose or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, what you can find on the market
concern, and especially in pharmacy or
[SPEAKER_00]: even in shop, it's low CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of product are allowed under
two main conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a daily dose of 50 milligrams per
day and a concentration of maximum 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: with sublingual oils, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two main conditions are from the
DGAL guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a governmental organism attached to
health ministry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit better because it brings
more clarity for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cannot ignore CBD product,
low dose CBD product, because actually
[SPEAKER_00]: it's concerned six millions people in
France.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge for pharmacy to
distribute this kind of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of customers at the moment
find their product using internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they go in a CBD shop, or even in
tobacco shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've potential quality issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no traceability, there's poor
advice, or there's even not at all advice
[SPEAKER_00]: by a seller at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality is a big problem at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traceability of the product has a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a really interesting studies
about Mildeca, or Mildeca, it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism attached to our prime minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important organism in France
about drugs and addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their mission is to fight against drug
and addictive behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made in 2023 a study about CBD
product, and the result was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 80% of CBD product actually in France
are not compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't answer to what they propose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the situation about French
medical cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to the numbers of
patients, how far are you guys behind,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say Germany, or how far you had from
the UK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific number that everybody
knows of?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know about how far we are
compared to German or UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are a bit late compared to this
market, especially UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we start with this kind of guideline,
what I told you, which now since one year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the market are increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it will increase in the next months
or the next years through, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly sure about that, through the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see one of the areas of growth
happening within France is the discovery
[SPEAKER_01]: of formulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the big biotech and pharma
companies able to find these perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: blends of cannabinoids and terpenes to be
able to deliver a finished product to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, maybe probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a crystal ball for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm sure it's like we need to
work, of course, about the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but about the bioavailability of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always looking for, for example,
for really good materials and create pills
[SPEAKER_00]: or tablets.
[SPEAKER_00]: To increase the bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the moment, if we talk about,
for example, terpenes or CBG or CBN to
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacy, I think it's a bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at early stage of to introduce CBD
in pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be simple for a moment to
train pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be simple, it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, they are OK now with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you talk to a pharmacist three,
four years earlier about CBD, they will
[SPEAKER_00]: not take you seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they take you seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a main step that we are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe later, and I hope we will
introduce a bit more interesting product,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe with CBG, with CBN and depends about
the regulation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you were stating, one of the big
hurdles seems to be the educating of
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors and pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe tell us about some of the
work that you're currently doing when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to bring this forward in France?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was I told before when I was
presenting myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big part of the job is
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second big part, it's education,
education pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing right now, for example,
so I'm doing training, live training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomorrow I'm going in a city close to
my city and I'm going to train a group
[SPEAKER_00]: between 30 and 40 pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to use CBD product in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be super interesting for them
and for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, I'm doing online training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think that it will be so
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are pharmacist manager,
which are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the second or third hand
of the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and they realize that they have
to offer compliant products and to advise
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They realize that CBD customers need
strong support, even for low dose CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, OK, is crucial, but offering
correct advice to patients, I realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: is vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, for example, if I tell
you some training goals, I will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: some about our training.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, first, how to identify good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So provide basics on cannabinoids to make
difference between CBD, THC, broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, full spectrum, or even the
vehicles used, the oil vehicle which is
[SPEAKER_00]: used in product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main parts, and I realize,
too, that make this little light in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain of the pharmacy is not to talk
directly about the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like this is better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they are really interesting at
the moment, it's the under cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are super interesting about how CBD
can work in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new path of healing, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So integrate CBD products into pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommendation with several practical case
are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them, too, because they just hear
about CBD, OK, it's too calm or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: May I introduce that they can use or they
can advise CBD for inflammatory problems
[SPEAKER_00]: or to prevent inflammatory problems or
about immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often really a large possibility
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The synergy of CBD with other products,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are super interesting to keep back
the market in their pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my goal, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD in pharmacy, even low dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another point where I really push on it,
it's to raise awareness about interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, OK, CBD at 50 milligrams a
day, it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody is covered, quite safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible there's some auto medication
at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to double or triple the dose is quite
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this problem, like CBD,
it's an inhibitor of cytochrome P450.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be a subject of many
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really the role of the
pharmacist to prevent people about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a pharmacist can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we insist on the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We insist on how to advise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, both points are really crucial
about prescription or non-prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about the CBD in general, the CBD
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I can conclude that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But education is the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the CBD, is it just
coming from plant matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 95 percent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it an applied pharmacy where it's
around 99 percent purity?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends about the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, CBD at 99 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than pure CBD, it's more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you promote oils and you work
with a broad spectrum CBD, it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting about the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another subject because I'm not
against this theory of entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not pro about this theory of
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be used in a bad way,
like in a marketing way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there's probably a synergy between
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some different cannabinoids
working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm OK with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this magic effect, like I don't really
like the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: No magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way, what I'm waiting really
strongly, it's the API CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some now on the market for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are a bit overpriced,
but it will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will decrease, I bet, over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be really interesting to to
maybe to have more quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already heard about some different
CBD, natural one, that the bioavailability
[SPEAKER_00]: can be increased by two or two point five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super interested about this kind
of product that I can I can promote to
[SPEAKER_00]: some manufacturer in France and then after
to create a really nice drug on
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription or without prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been absolutely fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to you, Julie,
and it's great to get an update on
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that's going on in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's going to be a big prominent
market when the whole medical landscape is
[SPEAKER_01]: is developing and evolving over the next
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we get to touch base in about
six to seven months and see the progress
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've made over in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody who wants to learn more
about Julian's company, you can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: website is below and it will be available
