[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking all things the world's best weed
on this episode and I'm delighted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: joined in this episode by Nate Lando who
is a co-founder at Snowtail Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snowtail have developed a unique
cultivation method that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss here in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Nate, thank you very much for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing my research and as I kept
coming across more photos and videos of
[SPEAKER_00]: your products I was salivating at the
mouth looking at how beautiful and amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I said I had to get you guys on to
discuss exactly what the key to the
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets are and maybe help educate the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody quick in
under 60 seconds how you guys came to
[SPEAKER_00]: create Snowtail and what are the main
objectives of the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Snowtail in general was created by
Masoso Fukoko, a Japanese scientist in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the next generation of organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we build our own soil once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lasts for 13 or 14 cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole ecosystem where everything's
alive and this has three main benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows the ponds to maximize the
genetic potential because they can take
[SPEAKER_01]: what it wants when it wants it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is it's very sustainable
this close to zero waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: All our leaves, stems, everything goes
right back on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third thing is it cuts out a lot
of the production cost and really
[SPEAKER_01]: simplifies it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty much give our plants plain
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to move straight on to the
first topic and it's unique cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain to everybody maybe what is
no-till farming and the method that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys use?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, most modern agriculture people till
their soil in between each cycle and that
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks up the soil food web in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what we do is we harvest our plants
and all the plant material gets put back
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the roots get to decompose in the
soil and it's already created the mycelium
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when we put in the next plant,
they get to follow the plant where the
[SPEAKER_01]: root system is already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, most of the nutrients are
in the roots itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what we do uniquely is most of it's
done outdoors or greenhouses and we do it
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because quality is really, really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the control you get indoors,
you just can't get, we've grown in every
[SPEAKER_01]: single methodology possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing a no-till living soil indoors is
the way that we found produces the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in terms of cover crops, they're only
required, let's say, for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That indoor cultivation, it's more about
the essence of the soil is which is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you the best product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we do have a rice hay as our
mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main source of nutrients for
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're not feeding the plants directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're feeding the microbial life that's in
the soil and the microbial life as a
[SPEAKER_01]: symbiotic relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next topic I want to jump onto is
cultivating with aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for anybody who hasn't seen any of
the Snow-Till products, the website is
[SPEAKER_00]: just down below there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you go and watch the
videos and the products that they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are, let's say, the top two
parameters that you guys set when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the end aesthetic of the flower that
you're going to sell to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as you know, the devil's in the
detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: High-end handbags are still sewn by hand
and not by machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we treat every single bud with love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why it looks, we call Snow-Till
because it looks like our buds are snowy
[SPEAKER_01]: is, again, that's to do with the
cultivation method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we make sure we do the property
leafing and the right training and pruning
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, every single bud gets the right amount
of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, every single one looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have grading systems on our flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, everything that leaves our facility
has to be grade A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when it comes to the aesthetic of the
plant, you obviously are using land-raised
[SPEAKER_00]: previous strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who finds your, let's say, your genetics
that you mix together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the main objective that you
look for when you're searching for a
[SPEAKER_00]: land-rise?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the thing is, trends come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you chase a trend,
it's already on the new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we stick to classics like our motor
breath OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain stuff that might drop in
popularity temporarily, but always comes
[SPEAKER_01]: back because there's certain effects that
people are looking for at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day with all the names and the hives and
the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people consume cannabis that are
looking for a certain effect, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with a handful of breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, it has to obviously have a
unique terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to look a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we're a for-profit
business, so it has to have a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that would be the three things we're
looking for when we test out new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you mentioned that you guys are
cultivating with an indoor facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically the model that can be
classified as medical grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over in Europe, we're starting to see the
industry mature, and Germany are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize hopefully 2023-2024 timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the number one tip that
you'd give to indoor cultivars in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: that are looking at getting into this
industry and maybe potential cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: down the line themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first of all, the way you design a
facility is crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to make sure you can't cut
corners especially on your HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very expensive, especially today
with the supply chain issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that can make or break your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the proper HVAC and you
can't have full control over your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, then there's no point of
doing it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so for everybody, HVAC is humidity,
ventilation, and air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, is that basically a pest deterrent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the best way of doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it giving more life to the plant to
your HVAC system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that on a par with ECS system then?
[SPEAKER_00]: A close second behind in terms of things
people need to keep their eye on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it has a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to maximize its health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, nature is cruel.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the season, most plants die
and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we're doing the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like babying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the perfect optimal point of a
percent of humidity and temperature you
[SPEAKER_01]: want at different stages of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would really exemplify the plant
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely helps with bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the humidity gets too high,
you're inviting a whole host of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different pests thrive in different
climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you don't have control over that,
then you have just created a perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, let's say, for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the last thing you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with indoors is it's a
zero-sum game.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nowhere for them to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you do get a pest in your
facility, they don't really want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you provided the environment they
thrive in, then they are going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do California grow the best cannabis in
the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the birthplace of almost all
modern genetics that come from the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say also Southern Oregon is
definitely up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They decriminalized all the way back in
the 70s, so it was a lot easier for them
[SPEAKER_01]: to get around the law then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say Southern Oregon and
Northern California is where all our
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely up-and-coming rivals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, the best cannabis in the
world is still in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last topic I wanted to touch on,
is the future of cannabis flower going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in craft batches?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you can go to a store and buy a
$3 bottle of wine and buy a $100 bottle of
[SPEAKER_01]: wine, and they both sell really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to have a very huge
budget if you want to compete on the
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like Bud Light is the most
popular beer in the US, but craft
[SPEAKER_01]: breweries are cutting into the market
share every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing is going to happen here,
and you have to decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not going to be a lot of room for
mid-grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to either be mass-produced,
or there's going to be crafting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you cannot compromise or cut any
corners and don't grow too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that produced a really
amazing product when they were small
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, and then they jumped from 5,000
square feet to 100,000 square feet,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's their quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen that, unfortunately,
even here in California with some amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that they lose their quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll always be able, like in
Colorado, the most mature market in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, they still go for $50, $60,
$8, which is three and a half grams,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that price point has never changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other price points have gone down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to stay true to your
principles if you're a craft grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: and never expand too fast no matter what
market pressures or investor pressures
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think cannabis is one of the few
industries worldwide where there doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be really a budget market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, if they've got an opportunity
to buy the best weed, will sooner have
[SPEAKER_00]: less of the best weed than a lot of the
shittest weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the craft batches,
and basically you guys being in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, do you see the eastern
seaboard of the United States being an
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive market to open up a facility,
or do you think that there's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years away before it's on a par
with the west coast?
[SPEAKER_01]: So because the US is unique, where every
state is completely different,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a hodgepodge of rules,
New York is definitely showing some
[SPEAKER_01]: promise of being a good market.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, most of the TVs
produced there, the financial markets
[SPEAKER_01]: there, there's a lot of reasons why New
York will be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like everything rollout is really
slow, and the regulations change
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly and confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say we're we will see a fully
open developed market in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is epicenter for the east coast,
in two years from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is still a little bit of time,
but yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am from New York, and we are definitely
going to have a branch there sooner or
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing the battle for
the best flower in America heating up over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next couple of years, because I think
somewhere like New York has so much small
[SPEAKER_00]: little potential, small grow farmers that
can work on genetics over a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years and perfect a plant in a specific
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be very interesting to
see what happens and not to mind then
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe with the history of farming that
we've already got over here when
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations allow people to advance and do
some research and development about
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an exciting global
industry over the next five to ten years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it
where we countries, legalize it so there
[SPEAKER_01]: can be cross border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, we still don't have
interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though the border is really tiny
in between states and really isn't the
[SPEAKER_01]: border, you can't do it because that
border is federal jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can't wait till we have interstate
commerce and international where we can
[SPEAKER_01]: just be treated like any other industry
where you have to compete on quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: price and service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reached up our time now,
but thank you very much, Nate,
[SPEAKER_00]: for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to see what I was talking
about with SnowTill, I highly recommend go
[SPEAKER_00]: visit their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're over the West Coast of
America, I highly recommend trying their
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys come to the East Coast,
I'll be one of your first customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to keeping an eye on
everything with SnowTill and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to chat with you guys over the
next year and see your expansion plans and
[SPEAKER_00]: how everything's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming, Nate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
