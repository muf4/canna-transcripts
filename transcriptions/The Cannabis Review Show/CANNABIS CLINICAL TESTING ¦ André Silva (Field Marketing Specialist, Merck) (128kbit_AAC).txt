[SPEAKER_01]: the next episode of the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be under this episode by
André Silva, who's a field marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist in Europe, working for Merck.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, André?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking the time to
do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of your position in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sector and what key areas specialize
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thank you for having me on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge pleasure to feature an episode
on quality and control from a laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: product provider perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say that my journey in this
industry has started back in 2019 as I
[SPEAKER_00]: started working for Merck as a technical
sales specialist, a role in which I
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated collaboration with key customers
in the European market on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm referring to pharmaceutical
companies starting production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And implementing their own quality control
labs, but also general testing labs
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to initiate analysis on the
different cannabinoid components and
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of last year,
I've also had the honor to join the
[SPEAKER_00]: editorial advisory board for Cannabis
Science and Technology magazine in the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S., in which I've worked to support with
scientific articles and content review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm currently performing the role of
field marketing specialist for Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe covering the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a pretty big sector that you guys are
covering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me what are the main
compounds that are being tested by quality
[SPEAKER_01]: control labs such as yourselves at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't do the analysis ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide products for laboratories to
perform the analysis and the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a quite broad topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to summarize it the best to my
ability and briefly explain the reasoning
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about final products out
in the market and this can be reflected in
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical, nutraceutical,
cosmetics, food and beverage items,
[SPEAKER_00]: we as consumers expect a rigorous quality
control examination to take place to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure the safety, reliability,
but also the quality of the products that
[SPEAKER_00]: reach us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cannabis, as a strict regulatory
framework takes place, this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, of extremely high importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now looking at cannabis testing,
there are two key designations commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: used by the industry depending on the
focus of the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on one hand, we have potency testing,
which looks at the cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of the plants, essentially the key
constituents that attracted attention due
[SPEAKER_00]: to their therapeutical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, we have purity
testing, which looks at the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: external contaminants that could have been
introduced to the cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with potency testing,
cannabinoids is for sure the loudest
[SPEAKER_00]: sibling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone at this point has heard about CBD
and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from one angle, we have a group of
psychoactive cannabinoids that are heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: With most often clear maximum levels to be
respected, therefore extremely important
[SPEAKER_00]: to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your raw materials and final product
should not contain these compounds about
[SPEAKER_00]: the established levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, THC is by far the most
known here and the European Commission has
[SPEAKER_00]: set a limit of 0.3% in industrial hemp
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has to mandatorily be respected
and testing is the only way to prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC is, however, not alone in this
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as research progresses, newer
cannabinoids are continuously found,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of which have even stronger
psychoactive responses than THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as THCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in-depth studies will then assess the
potency, the potential of these compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will eventually dictate whether or
not maximum levels should be enforced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's currently a very dynamic field of
research, as you can imagine, that
[SPEAKER_00]: requires close observation to ensure full
regulatory compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a slightly different angle,
we have the non-psychoactive cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, they've been accepted by
the European Commission to be legally used
[SPEAKER_00]: as ingredients in food products and
cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this area, people have heard about
CBD and CBG, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays, it is not surprising to come
across extracts, concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other products containing cannabinoids
in dispensaries and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this large non-psychoactive group also
requires testing for the identification
[SPEAKER_00]: and quantification of the different
compounds, which should be performed by a
[SPEAKER_00]: certified lab in order to showcase overall
integrity, good manufacturing practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also a strict quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then have the terpenes, which are a
class of compounds responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: fragrance and aroma of a wide variety of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, cannabis strains have
terpene profiles that give them a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the individual terpenes themselves are
found in many other common plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, for instance, limonin, which is found
in citrus fruits, or pining, and as the
[SPEAKER_00]: name indicates, can be found in pine
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these have also been affirmed
to promote certain therapeutic effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: both acting in isolation, but also as part
of the commonly known entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: a synergistic action that is modulated by
various terpenes and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have companies here in this spectrum
looking at cannabis extracts with a
[SPEAKER_00]: cocktail of cannabinoids and terpenes,
as opposed to isolate specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes terpenes another target
group that requires testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now covered the two main groups
of interest for cannabis potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And considering their varied chemical
structure and internal properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can already tell that they will require
different preparation techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical methods and tools in order for
the testing to be performed with accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: and precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we dive into purity testing now,
a whole new range of external contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: comes into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have an overview of the entire
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the cultivation phase,
pesticides are commonly used to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lists here are extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the US, for instance, this
framework changes from state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few states have guidelines in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, there still seems to be some
uncertainty and unclarity around this
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, it matters to test not just
the pesticides that have been used during
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivation process, but also the ones
that have been one banned by the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory agencies in place, but that
could also have been somehow introduced in
[SPEAKER_00]: the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, plants, and in this case,
cannabis plants, have the capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and bio accumulate heavy metals
from soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're jumping yet into another complex
regulatory landscape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have some highly regulated metals,
such as cadmium, lead, arsenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an even longer list that
requires monitoring and that if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise overlooked can possess serious
health risks to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so we sort of covered the
interferences that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation phase, the most significant
ones, but thinking about the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: process and how it affects the final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, method dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If extraction is performed with the aid of
solvents, such as butane and methanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: residual solvent testing is required to
guarantee that no dangerous levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: these compounds are left in the end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, and depending on the matrix
that's being worked on, produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can talk about isolates, concentrates,
extracts, leaves, flowers, seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: or any other final product, all present
different challenges and the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: methods that need to be adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excessive moisture in cannabis plant
parts, for instance, can lead to mold
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and degradation, which can then
allow fungi, micro fungi, to produce toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, namely, mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, this adds the additional
need to perform testing around microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, the presence of mycotoxins,
and quantification, and even moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that was a lot of information in
one go, and there are certainly areas in
[SPEAKER_00]: which I haven't touched, but these are
admittedly crucial analysis to be
[SPEAKER_00]: performed on raw materials and final
products involving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis testing market involves an
ample range of techniques and equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to ensure the safety, potency,
and quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where product providers come
into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accurate testing is, of course,
crucial, essential here to meet regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements, protect consumer health,
but also support the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible and regulated cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the testing of these
products and the specific molecules that
[SPEAKER_01]: are these ingredients, we've obviously got
three when it comes to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got plant extractive matter,
we've got synthetic, and then we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation, engineering, and
bioprocessing to create a replicable
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me the future of the
ingredient side of the industry is the
[SPEAKER_01]: bioprocessing and fermentation engineering
because of the scalability and the
[SPEAKER_01]: replication that can be had on the purity
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a case that comes to testing that
there is a discrepancy between the three
[SPEAKER_01]: different separate molecules from the
three different production methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will, of course, need to be adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've mentioned, for instance,
synthetic cannabinoids, which product
[SPEAKER_00]: providers have already a set of tools in
place for this testing to be performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing will overall be present and
whatever method is choose to to scale up
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of these different
compounds that you've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and what are the main roadblocks in
the development of the testing market at
[SPEAKER_01]: EU?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say from my perspective,
regulatory restrictions seem to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: current primary obstacle on this road to
develop the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cannabis and its components
specifically can't be handled,
[SPEAKER_00]: transported, manufactured or even sold to
the consumer, the need for testing also
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes limited just as a possibility for
new research and new end products to be
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at a stage where companies have for
quite some years invested in a market with
[SPEAKER_00]: some degree of uncertainty and the future
of their work essentially depends on when
[SPEAKER_00]: and if any advancements are to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having said that, most countries in
Western Europe have given green light to
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicinal cannabis market with
individual specifications and core pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: programs in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays, more than before,
we do read news about ongoing discussions
[SPEAKER_00]: on the recreational market, new approaches
being explored in order to forge a path to
[SPEAKER_00]: safely introduce products to the shelves
and to open them to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this, however, in my perspective,
leads to yet another challenge,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is lack of harmonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: While some European countries have
established regulations, there's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of harmonization across the region,
across the board, which in turn can lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to discrepancies in the testing
requirements and the product standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've personally found by speaking with
a lot of companies that operate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field that in our European market,
there seems to be a certain knowledge gap,
[SPEAKER_00]: a need for guidance with end users turning
to more advanced markets such as the US to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer common questions related to overall
manufacturing, certification processes and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will, of course, support the
development of the market itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time and up to an extent
will contribute to the lack of consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: and reliability of the products released
in our European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I would say these would be the
two main challenges that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tackled in order for the market to grow
healthily and steadily in the upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fascinating talking to you,
Andre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it mightn't be the most
romantic check for some, but having those
[SPEAKER_01]: viable products that are consistent and
reputable over and over again is the only
[SPEAKER_01]: way this industry can be taken as
seriously as, let's say, the chocolate
[SPEAKER_01]: industry or the fizzy drinks industry or
whatever they be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, again, we can catch up and
have a second part of this conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: because as I said, I think we're going to
have some movement in Europe over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm sure a man like yourself is going
to be very busy when we get some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: clear regulation from one of the
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to see where the market is
heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you again for having me in your
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
