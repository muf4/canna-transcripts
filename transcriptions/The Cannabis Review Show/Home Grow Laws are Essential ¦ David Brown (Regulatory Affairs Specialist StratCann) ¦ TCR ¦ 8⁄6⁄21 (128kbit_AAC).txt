[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by David Brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of you don't know David,
then you must be living in a rock in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a regulatory affairs specialist at
StratCan at the moment, but has an
[SPEAKER_01]: esteemed career so far in the cannabis
industry from board member at CFAM,
[SPEAKER_01]: policy advisor at Niche, editor-in-chief
at Lift Cannabis News, and a senior policy
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor to Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won't find a man with a better
background in the industry than David.
[SPEAKER_01]: David, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good Owen, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on, mate,
a man who's a wealth of knowledge and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: delighted to be able to get you on and
share some few things with the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been in the industry pretty long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to give everybody an overview
of your time in the industry so far and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll kick into topic one then after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah, I'd say I probably started in
the industry here in Canada about 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a co-founder of a company called
Lift Cannabis in 2014 that started as a
[SPEAKER_00]: news and review site for what was then the
new commercial medical cannabis program in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and really have just been covering
the cannabis industry since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent two years when I left Lift from
2018 to 2020 as a senior policy advisor to
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Canada's cannabis legalization and
regulation branch and worked with a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large team there at both the development
and implementation of the new regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: regime in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a pretty interesting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I left Health Canada in
2020, I got back into the media space with
[SPEAKER_00]: a website called StratCan covering just
different aspects of the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Canada, really with a focus on a
lot of the new license holders,
[SPEAKER_00]: micro cannabis license holders,
especially so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as everybody watching will be able to
understand, this man has got a great
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in the industry and hopefully
going to be able to guide us through the
[SPEAKER_01]: three topics for this week's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first topic I want to talk about is
cannabis 3.0 in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there going to be a cannabis 3.0 or was
the release of edibles and beverages,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what the market looks like in
cannabis or do you see a massive,
[SPEAKER_01]: another pivot coming sometime down the
line?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, in the sense that cannabis 2.0 was the
new products like edibles, extracts and
[SPEAKER_00]: topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't really see any cannabis 3.0 in
that sense where we will see any new
[SPEAKER_00]: products particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people refer to cannabis 3.0 here in
Canada, I think they maybe are referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to a couple different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think overall, we're seeing an evolution
of the industry beyond the sort of large
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly traded companies to a lot more
small, private mom and pop companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in some sense, that could be
cannabis 3.0 kind of a changing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: playing field.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we're also running up on
a three year review of the Cannabis Act
[SPEAKER_00]: later this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cannabis Act in Canada came into
force in October 17th, 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming up on three years here of
October 17th, 2021 when the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government will implement a three year
review of the regulations and we could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be seeing some fairly major
changes in the year and a half following
[SPEAKER_00]: that review, which you could potentially
call cannabis 3.0 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of new product categories,
we won't really see anything new beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the small evolutions we're seeing
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing some new topicals,
some interesting strips, kind of losing my
[SPEAKER_00]: words here for dissolvable strips,
some things like that in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, we're not really
seeing too many product evolutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I definitely have noticed the amount
of craft growers and different products
[SPEAKER_01]: that are popping up out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see that it's happened to
beer already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why it wouldn't happen in
cannabis across the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on to the second topic,
which I know a lot of people in Ireland
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be pretty adamant about being
part of a bill that's brought to
[SPEAKER_01]: parliament over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homegrown laws, are these essential for
any bill do you see in a newly regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: territory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I think it's very important,
especially because the first round of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations tend to set the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it could be very difficult to try
to ease regulatory changes like that later
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't think there's any good
reason to not allow home production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, here in Canada, we've got a four
plant limit in a few of the US states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen up to, I think, six or even
eight plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a reasonable amount
for a person to produce at home while at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time creating a clear delineation
between personal production and illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale unregulated production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's also very important in
terms of patients' rights for individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're relying on cannabis as
a medicine, buying through the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: system can often be very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for those individuals who have that
ability and have that space to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow even just a few plants for their own
medicine, I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's something that
should be part of any piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that there should be a
license allocated to somebody who wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, or should it just be open to anybody
who decides they want to put their hand to
[SPEAKER_01]: this part of agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a good argument perhaps to
be made on the medical side that there
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be some sort of authorization from
a medical professional or from your
[SPEAKER_00]: physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of non-medical cannabis
production, I don't see any reason for a
[SPEAKER_00]: permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the law is where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in Canada, you don't need a
permit to brew your own alcohol or to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: sunflowers in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really think there's a need for
all of the extra regulatory hurdles that
[SPEAKER_00]: would come with trying to implement that
kind of permitting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did Canada set up their home-grow
laws across the board?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it strictly illegal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have some of the different territories
become legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canada, when we legalized cannabis,
federally, the federal government allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: for up to four plants to be grown per
household, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some limits around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, that's the main limit is
four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian law also allows provinces to add
further restrictions to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've seen some limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one province, I believe New
Brunswick or Nova Scotia, has some rules
[SPEAKER_00]: around it having to be in a locked room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in British Columbia, where I live,
you can't have it in public view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have it, say, inside or in
your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen two provinces now, Quebec and
Manitoba, have both banned home
[SPEAKER_00]: production, which the federal government
says is not their right to limit it to
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could limit it to one, but not zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being fought in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case in Quebec was actually overturned
in late 2019, but the government
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately appealed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're waiting on that appeal now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another court case in Manitoba
that is challenging Manitoba's ban as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the overall expectation is that
they will be successful in overturning
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still unknown and has not made it
to the courts yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, it's legal in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of provinces that are
claiming they have the right to ban it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's being settled in court at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that basically down to political
ideology in terms of the places that are
[SPEAKER_01]: banning versus not banning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see a more democratic states or
territories that have grow laws compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to, let's say, more conservative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's probably a fair
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are conservative-run provinces that
have allowed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Quebec's current provincial government
tends to be fairly conservative and fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of their politicians have made some
fairly anti-cannabis statements in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also raised their age of access to
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the highest age of access in all of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manitoba, the other province who was
banned, it also has a very conservative
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's some sort of
anti-cannabis sentiment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gets into some issues that go well
beyond cannabis that have to do with an
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing push and pull between provincial
governments, especially conservative
[SPEAKER_00]: provincial governments, and the federal
government in terms of their rights to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage their own affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really, I think it has a lot more
to do with that than even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I say, we're seeing that courts
tend to agree that the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: has that sort of paramount authority to
issue those rules that the provinces can't
[SPEAKER_00]: push back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings me into the last territory,
our last topic that I wanted to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advice to governments looking to allow a
medical or adult use market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a couple of politicians lined up
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland is a new enough territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hasn't yet legalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a medical cannabis program,
but it's for six symptoms that,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, is not reflective of the
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even those people with symptoms are
having to pay 10 grand a month to get
[SPEAKER_01]: access to products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be, let's say, the two
biggest tips if a politician was watching
[SPEAKER_01]: this that you'd say, this is what a
government should implement if they were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think stakeholder involvement
really engaging all levels of the public,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think it's important for cannabis
activists and advocates to recognize that
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to reach that consensus means
engaging with people who maybe do not
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with you and hearing from teachers
and religious officials and public health
[SPEAKER_00]: experts and law enforcement, as well as
advocates and patient advocates and
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So engaging with the public and really
getting a good understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also say data collection is very
important beforehand so that you can build
[SPEAKER_00]: that baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be able to measure the
success of your program, say five or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years down the road, it's very important
to have that baseline data prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization so you have an understanding
of the effects of that law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has legalization increased use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it decreased use?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we're wrangling with
here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still pretty difficult to tease that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having that data beforehand has
allowed us to at least have a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline and understanding what we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and tell me this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked to some of the guys in
Colorado at the Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: Division and the Cannabis Bureau over in
LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys have a similar division in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: How were license applied?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure everything went to other national
license and excise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a department in Canada that
deltas the buffer between applications and
[SPEAKER_01]: going to excise, license and excise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in fact, that's the branch I worked
with at the time was the Health Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Legalization and Regulation
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now it's changed its iteration a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's essentially Health Canada's
cannabis and drug branch now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have several different departments
within that branch that deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from license applications going
in, and that's both on the commercial as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the personal and commercial
medical side, review of those licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: review of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole team now there that's
working on the review of those regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: that I referred to earlier, including
stakeholder engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very large department,
several hundred people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the buildup to those regulations,
they were engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those other departments that you
reference as well in different legal
[SPEAKER_00]: states, as well as Uruguay and countries
in Europe and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's constant sort of engagement
with their sister agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that department continues to grow
and I think will continue to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least until legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the industry has matured to a place
where maybe there isn't quite a need for
[SPEAKER_00]: that level of oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and the last topic, I kind of just
want to get a question on, do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: the Canadian LPs are targeting Europe as
the main customer base for a lot of their
[SPEAKER_01]: products, or do you believe that they're
going to be able to crack America once
[SPEAKER_01]: America legalizes statewide investment
will come in, mergers and acquisitions
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a galore, we'll have the one or
two major players in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the Canadian LPs will be able
to match the US companies when it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: said and done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think up until now, Canadian LPs have
been largely targeting different European
[SPEAKER_00]: countries with some level of medical
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia is another example of a country
where there's been some some exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at those numbers, honestly,
the export numbers are pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's probably an argument
to be made that that's largely about
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholder or investor relations and
trying to show their footprint in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries, even if it's not
particularly significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US is obviously the golden goose,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone would like to be operating there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on what the US
regulations end up looking like is still a
[SPEAKER_00]: big unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will Canadian companies be able to to ship
a product to the US?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they be able to set up in the US?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still really unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I think we're probably
several years away from any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: functional federal, even a medical system,
much less a non medical system in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's certainly where the big
companies are looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of of keeping investor hopes
up, pointing to a new emerging markets
[SPEAKER_00]: like that is kind of an ongoing tactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the battle of the entrepreneur,
the sun's up there on the hill,
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun's up there on the hill.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: David, thank you very much for joining the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been actually a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been a wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can get to chat again in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who wants to check in on
David's work, StratCon.com on the screen
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best sources of information in
the global cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind just Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you again, David, for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
