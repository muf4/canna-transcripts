[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the latest episode of
the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Mara Gordon.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the co-founder of the renowned
company Anselda.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping Mara?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to talk about the dosing and medical
cannabis on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe Mara, you could give the viewer
an overview of where you kind of got
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself into the cannabis review.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis industry and where you are at
the moment over in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that I got into cannabis
initially was because there was no data
[SPEAKER_00]: around dosing and what you were taking and
how you were taking it, how much to take
[SPEAKER_00]: for various diseases, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided to focus on solving the
dosing questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, this was back 2010 when I
started doing this and been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting data and working with patients
ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perfect person to talk about on this
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to jump straight away on the
first topic and that is the art of the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of the things I'm sure doctors
are afraid of prescribing the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't want to go near because
there's a myriad of combinations that can
[SPEAKER_01]: be actually put together and it all
depends on the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give everybody a little overview
on your methods and what you think may be
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect dose for different types of
people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the first thing I would say is
there's no such thing as a perfect dose
[SPEAKER_00]: for the typical person because there is
and we all have different endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and they all work differently with
different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have been able to identify
patterns that make it closer to a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a target dose where you work
with a patient or you were an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: work towards a target amount of the
cannabinoid that they're that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the understanding that they may
have to exceed it or they may not ever
[SPEAKER_00]: make it to that high point if they don't
need it, which is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do is we always look at any of
the data that's out there in the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have there been any studies preclinical or
clinical on a particular disease set?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then and then we're able to look from that
through our data because we have been
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting over 300 data points on each
patient going in and then looking at what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using and how they're using it and
then whether it's being effective or not
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to make some some some
predictions on what the target should be
[SPEAKER_00]: for various diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you based upon the
research that's been done in the
[SPEAKER_00]: preclinical on breast cancer, there's
three major subtypes of breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at what is where the cannabinoid
receptors are, whether they're present
[SPEAKER_00]: within these types of breast cancer and
something that we can target.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that THC actively activates the
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure there's THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that CBD also works in
another way of of on the cancer cells
[SPEAKER_00]: through other systems within the body as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might start out a ratio of one to
one on the amount of THC and CBD that the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient will use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based upon where their age is,
we have found that there's variances that
[SPEAKER_00]: as we get older, we need less to be able
to impact because of changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism and changes that we frankly
don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always I always stress that people
need to start with a very, very low dose
[SPEAKER_00]: of the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sometimes we have people that are
older, my age, and higher that we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: like one milligram to start and titrating
up very, very slowly so that we make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they don't have any adverse
reactions, because even though it might
[SPEAKER_00]: make somebody feel too activated or too
much psychoactivity at a particular dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you titrate slowly enough, you can
avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you stay at a certain level
long enough, like a few days to a week at
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain level, that makes you
uncomfortable, your body will acclimate
[SPEAKER_00]: and it no longer will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to titrate people up that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that you need more CBD than
THC because THC is much more powerful than
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you incorporate CBD, at some
point, you may go from that one to one to
[SPEAKER_00]: one to two, one to three, whatever higher
on the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have lab results that are
associated with a product, and I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: like lab results that show the cannabinoid
and terpene content beyond the just THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD, but even with just those,
if you have that, then you can calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: how many milligrams are in each dose so
that you can be very controlled on taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some topical here yesterday just
because I'm in Mexico right now and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have access to Aunt Zelda's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made some in my kitchen based on the
old style, the way I used to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted it to be 10 milligrams per
milliliter of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to take the extract that I
had, knowing the lab results that were on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, just do simple calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I figured out the volume of what
I was making, I was able to then calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: out how many milligrams of cannabinoids I
had to include in order to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend that people start
extremely slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, 2.5 milligrams as a wellness
dose of THC is often what it takes to get
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're treating serious diseases,
then it's a completely different subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for something like anxiety or slight
pain for a healthy person or somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: just needs a little edge to get to sleep,
that 2.5 may be all they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you think 2.5 would be the same when
it comes to, let's say, a CBD edible?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we're going to have an influx of
them in the market a lot of the time when
[SPEAKER_01]: the novel food license applications in
Europe especially go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you what do you recommend is the
perfect dosage for a snack bar or for an
[SPEAKER_01]: active treat?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're talking about CBD,
it depends on how it's derived and what
[SPEAKER_00]: else is in there, because CBD on its own
may make somebody feel activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people talk about it not having
any psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not true if it's a whole
plant where it's including terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: other components that may make an impact
how a person feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the hemp varieties that are
being grown have higher levels of pining
[SPEAKER_00]: in them, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these might make somebody feel very,
very focused or it might make somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: feel very activated and uncomfortable and
anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, I would say that if you're
going to get a candy bar or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, first of all, I don't like that
whole idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are, if you're going to get a
food product, I think keeping the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing under 10 milligrams for that purpose
is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you have something that can
easily be subdivided into pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately, then you can have 100
milligrams for the whole thing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to get 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not medical products,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, well, these are products for
people that are self-medicating that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they have like a little minor
ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just need that little edge
taken off instead of having a glass of
[SPEAKER_00]: wine or a beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but if you're talking about people
that are ill or people that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: having trouble with pain or anxiety or,
you know, PTSD, things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they may need 50 to 100 milligrams
to accomplish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people that say that they
feel a lot better from five to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, I think a lot of that is the
placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you, I'm going to move on to the next
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the audience formal clinical
cannabis research and trials that have
[SPEAKER_01]: happened and we know that they've taken an
extremely long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you maybe give an overview of where
the industry is at that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there products ready to come to market
apart from the handful that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: already made it over here in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the overview on that part?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a panel last week where we were
talking about this exact topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I am seeing is that there's a lot
of innovation going on outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States still has so many
barriers to be able to do solid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the barrier to entry of a drug into
the marketplace from the FDA is is much
[SPEAKER_00]: stricter than it is in some other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EU is pretty strict, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the but it's certainly like places
like Australia, where we do trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa, Brazil, Colombia,
Portugal, for example, places like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with that, it takes it takes
years to get something through process and
[SPEAKER_00]: millions and millions and millions of
dollars to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, when we through Zillier
therapeutics, which I've co-founded also,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we when we were trialing our Zenovol
product, we were able to use the data that
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been accumulating through and
Zelda's over the years for people that had
[SPEAKER_00]: insomnia to be able to get a target dose
to start with, to have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and a more likelihood of
success with the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, most trials fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could start out with something
that's already got somewhat of a track
[SPEAKER_00]: record, you have a better opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to go through everything from
safety tests and then you have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through a whole trial of safety and you
have something called PK, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to find out what the actual dose
tolerance is so that you make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: stay within a certain amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to try it in small group
and then a larger group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking double blind placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had I spoke to an oncology nurse one
time in pediatrics and she said,
[SPEAKER_00]: how am I supposed to how am I supposed to
do this double blind when it's so obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: which patients are vomiting and which
patients aren't vomiting and which
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are happy and which patients
aren't based upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's where's the placebo on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have recommended is that drugs go
through more of a biopharmaceutical plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, nutraceutical type model of
approval instead of going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole, you know, FDA system, which is it
can take a decade and millions and
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still no guarantee that you're
going to get anything to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that Epidiolex was just approved in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a not a very good product,
but they've spent millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars and years GW getting it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be hard to to catch up
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one the one thing that I do recommend
is that I'm not sure whether you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ireland or whether it's and that is the
concept of orphan drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orphan diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are these are diseases that
there's not enough people that that are
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been diagnosed with this to
justify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's an actual number,
I think it's like 200 and fifty thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: or something, where there's an actual
where there's not enough people for the
[SPEAKER_00]: typical pharmaceutical companies to
develop a treatment for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's not enough people
with Huntington's.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really not enough pediatric
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my world, it seems like it's
constant, but it's really in reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drave, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are rare diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the obstacles to getting a drug
through trialing is much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did an observational study at CHOP's
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on
[SPEAKER_00]: autism, looking at four formulations there
for our hope line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't part of it, but it was my
company that did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to observe based upon
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was groundbreaking to be able to
do that at a mainstream institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a drug to market by going
through an orphan designation and then
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing it off label is is a really
good option for getting drugs out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many, many drugs get to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get there for one thing and then
doctors use them for many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to end with the last topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're nearly running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in Mexico at the moment,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The on off again legislation that seems to
be happening there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your overview of the industry over
there at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it ready to explode or is it still
going to trot along for another little
[SPEAKER_01]: while?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to trot along for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking in an event in Cancun in
November, and it's a business and
[SPEAKER_00]: technology event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hope is that at that time,
we'll be able to sit down with some more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the decision makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have already been talking with with
groups that are going for licensing to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and manufacture, and I'm hoping
something will happen this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a it's a it's a complicated
culture here with, you know, the history
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's kind of funny to think
about people bringing now so much cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: from California to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go into the country, there's
signs saying you're not allowed to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana into the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just it's just hilarious to me
based upon where we came from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that in the next year,
we'll see at least some regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to take place, because,
yes, it's been it's been legalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no infrastructure yet to
support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to get somebody on to further
educate us on the Mexican industry over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been amazing talking to you,
Mary, your wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we get to chat again in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
