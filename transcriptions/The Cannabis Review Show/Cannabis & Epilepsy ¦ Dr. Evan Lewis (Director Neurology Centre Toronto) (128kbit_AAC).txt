[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by Dr. Evan Lewis of the Neurology
[SPEAKER_00]: Center in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan is a pediatric neurologist and a
clinical neurophysiologist and has
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise in epilepsy and epilepsy surgery
and medical cannabis for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurological disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on the show,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a man with a wealth of knowledge in
this topic and it's great to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to the article that we had over
here in Ireland about some information
[SPEAKER_00]: that may or may not be misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave it down to an expert like
yourselves to give us the good information
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might give the audience a little brief
overview of how you got to where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: in Toronto and your expertise in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally from Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Canadian born and grew up in Toronto,
but did my training in Ottawa in pediatric
[SPEAKER_01]: neurology and epilepsy and completed my
full training in Miami a year there and a
[SPEAKER_01]: year in Toronto at the Hospital for Sick
Children.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was following my training that was
really when medical cannabis was coming up
[SPEAKER_01]: from the grassroots from a lot of the
parent organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is circa 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: To 2012, 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around that time, I had a bit of an
interest, but there was a lot of stigma
[SPEAKER_01]: around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most, the vast majority of doctors and
neurologists were not utilizing it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That piqued my interest, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: After working for about a year and a half
at the Hospital for Sick Children,
[SPEAKER_01]: I left and opened up my center,
the Neurology Center in Toronto,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a community neurology practice in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, I was able to be free a little bit
of hospital oversight administration and
[SPEAKER_01]: could pursue some in my own interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I really started to move into
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was around that time that I just
started collecting a lot of patients that
[SPEAKER_01]: were coming to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of through my own experience,
my own self-learning, and through my
[SPEAKER_01]: patients who I owe a huge amount of thanks
because they taught me so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: really was able to move forward into the
medical cannabis world and started with
[SPEAKER_01]: pediatric epilepsy, which was my area that
I'm trained in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the most confidence and felt that it
was safe to pursue that with medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and subsequently evolved that
into other pediatric neurological
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders and adults as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's culminated in kind of years of
experience now and through many patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: both adults and kids, as I mentioned,
through epilepsy and non-epilepsy
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, we've gained quite a lot of
experience here in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just reviewing all of our patients
now and we're following over 500 patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now for various neurological
disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I think I lost you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on mute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, I'm on back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly positioned then to be able to
assist us in this next topic that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking beforehand, you've read
the article that was published in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Irish Times where a number of doctors came
out saying they weren't sure about the
[SPEAKER_00]: products that were being prescribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: From your point of view, and over in
Canada, are there a safe list of products
[SPEAKER_00]: that are prescribed to patients over in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, are they available in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really important because each
country tends to have its own regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: framework and its own product
availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most products that I have access to in
Canada are Canadian products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very few products coming from
elsewhere and that has to do a lot with
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation, but a lot to do with cost as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the products are similar in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ratios for THC-CBD are similar and the
corresponding additives, whether they be
[SPEAKER_01]: turpenes or other components, are also
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is similarity between the
products that are available in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But predominantly through our regulatory
framework here, we can access those
[SPEAKER_01]: products quite readily that are Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, there's no sense to import
products at this point and utilize them
[SPEAKER_01]: just because the costs are enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, Epidiox is one that often
gets asked about in Canada and GW Pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: has not moved into Canada as a market
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to purchase Epidiox is just exorbitant
for families.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense at all when we
have analogous products such as purified
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD oils here available in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see, in your opinion,
the best medicines or the best versions of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for epilepsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific ratio of THC that
seems to work best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is pure CBD actually proven to work with
epilepsy patients where there's no THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we obviously have a much more stricter
rules over here when it comes to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just curious as to know,
is there the perfect ratio of THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: for an epilepsy medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a question that remains
unanswered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to know this and we don't know
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we haven't done any real head to
head trials on the different and varying
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have really good randomized control
trials with purified CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were the main ones that came out
over the last decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives us some direction from the
purified CBD point of view, some outcome
[SPEAKER_01]: data and some adverse effect data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very high level evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to rely on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we also have some studies that
have come out that have been more open
[SPEAKER_01]: label related studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as high level in terms of
evidence as we have available for the
[SPEAKER_01]: purified CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they certainly show some positive
outcomes for CBD rich extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are oils that have a higher amount
of CBD in proportion to THC, but have a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant amount of THC in their
products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have good outcome data there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have good safety data there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when it comes to that perfect ratio
question, it's often a question I get
[SPEAKER_01]: asked a lot by patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have experience in cannabis
medicine, you can design your own ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I can give a purified CBD oil
and give X number of milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I could also supplement that with
a purified THC oil and then give X number
[SPEAKER_01]: of milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make my own ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think there's a perfect ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that question is a big black
box and we really don't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is I think that the
resultant answer is going to come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the certain epilepsy condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what is driving the epilepsy
disorder, that is going to be what
[SPEAKER_01]: determines the ultimate proportion of CBD
to THC or other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't going to be a perfect
proportionate amount of CBD THC to all
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy syndromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a bit of a misunderstanding
how epilepsy works because epilepsy just
[SPEAKER_01]: means a tendency to have seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there can be thousands of causes for
that tendency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to treat the tendency and not
the actual seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the medicine that's coming in
the future for medical cannabis to really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the proportion based on the
disease entity that's causing the
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the things that
hinders the doctors over here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to dose a patient perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the future of medical cannabis is
a patient being given an option of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their own individual ratio is going to be
determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you said, you're going to have
standardized medicine based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: different ailment that you've got or the
age group or the health group that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting within.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever see a scenario where somewhere
like over in Ireland, we have legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to grow yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an argument for if we're going to
create a grow industry that we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the ailments that people suffer
from in Ireland?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's look at the strains that work
best for these ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is going to be a medical
cannabis program that there is strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are made in Ireland,
they're available for Irish patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's going to be
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where do you stop there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which varieties of cannabis do you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you pick those varieties of
cannabis, which ailments do you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can you can individualize this
forever and ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reduce this down to, you know,
so many different levels that that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a real complicated path to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly, I don't think I know the
answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody could reliably
know the answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sounds like where things are
headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess one way to look at that is
ultimately probably what's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: very important here is the individual
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the the pharmacogenetics and the
understanding of how genetics affects the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system, that is all that
and time is going to help us dictate the
[SPEAKER_01]: right treatment approaches for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in addition to the disease state,
as I mentioned before, so it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and the actual disease,
the genetics of the individual and the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual disease causing whatever ailment it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the combination of that and really
understanding that and how it interplays
[SPEAKER_01]: with the endocannabinoid system will
ultimately allow us to tailor therapies
[SPEAKER_01]: accordingly, rather than going kind of the
other approach from the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we do that from the other end,
you do that forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if we would really come
up with good answers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to to help with that right now,
because we have to kind of work with what
[SPEAKER_01]: we have right now, it's important for for
a practitioner like myself, an experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioner to develop standardized
protocols based on the best available
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we do in my center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've developed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as an example for our epilepsy
patients, we have a very standardized
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol that works through successive
phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those phase so all patients that come
in with epilepsy from a certain cause
[SPEAKER_01]: start in a phase one, we work them through
the phase one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they fail, they go to phase
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they fail, they go to phase three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go through those phases,
the treatment becomes more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: individualized to the to the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that way, at least I know I'm
standardizing myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can use those protocols to base
further treatment decisions for my entire
[SPEAKER_01]: population, but also for the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one way that a practitioner
right now can try to approach these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start to do all these
different kind of various different
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches, then you might not really know
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could lead to actually causing
more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that kind of leaves me on the last
topic I want to talk about is future
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be after a discussion now that
the perfect scenario is purified THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: purified CBD and a ratio balance for each
individual patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you see the medical cannabis
industry unfolding over the next number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that's what I do here,
just to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use the oils with certain
proportions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not so much about that proportion
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's more about the actual dose,
the actual milligram dose, because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that that can stay consistent for patient
to patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, coming back to the phase
protocols, we have our phase one protocol
[SPEAKER_01]: targets reaching a dose of three hundred
milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an example in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just generalizing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing and that's based on the
available evidence that has been produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some, again, there's some
other slight changes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to comment on this,
I'm very happy to discuss in detail with
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's the first target.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of a milligram dose,
because that can stay consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can read the literature and I can
see what's being used for a milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: based dose and not so much these
proportions.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be very honest, when it comes down to
how much THC is being included or what
[SPEAKER_01]: not, I do have standards for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes I'm constrained by the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, for instance, sorry about
that there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, the the cost of high CBD
rich extracts is really expensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: totally unaffordable for families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have no public coverage of our
cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I'm at a loss and I have to
offer a patient a higher amount of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: proportionate to CBD when really I really
want to target a higher CBD proportion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a bit constrained by other factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that that's some of the
difficulty that we see in other countries
[SPEAKER_01]: right now as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tends to be that cost does kind of
drive where things are at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so coming back to your question,
I would love a scenario in which I could
[SPEAKER_01]: just design my own proportions and help
patients in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not practical due to cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not practical due to regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm stuck with having to use the
proportions that are available and that
[SPEAKER_01]: are affordable for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to manipulate the protocol for
those patients accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know of any products in Europe that
you think are worth keeping an eye out for
[SPEAKER_00]: or is Epidiolex seems to be the main one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, I probably don't want to go
into mentioning specific products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, Epidiolex is the reason why
Epidiolex and I mentioned it is so
[SPEAKER_01]: popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epidiolex was the product that was used in
the randomized control trials in the US
[SPEAKER_01]: that really resulted in approval by the
FDA and approval in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it's kind of a little bit of that
gold standard if you really go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the trials that have been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But subsequent to that, there are many
trials in Israel, trials in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's work in Germany that's
been done that has used CBD rich extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: from various different companies with
results that are as good as what we saw in
[SPEAKER_01]: Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trial or sometimes better, given that
there was no these are not the same degree
[SPEAKER_01]: of evidence and quality of control in
those trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that at least points to positive
signal here that there are CBD rich
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts from various different companies
that contain THC that are effective in
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my personal experience of my
patients, we see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, THC is necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just actually published a paper from
my center here in conjunction with the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Montreal, my colleague,
Dr. Will, where we showed a case series of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients who failed CBD, but then
responded to THC and incremental doses of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a great case study that shows
resolution of complete resolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures, maldevelopment neurologically
and EEG normalization with THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: not with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a role here for we have to
understand it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think anybody who has some
understanding of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system can understand where and how THC
comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of my big responses to
the Irish Times article was it just speaks
[SPEAKER_01]: to me that there's a lack of education
about THC and an overall vilification of
[SPEAKER_01]: this substance probably embedded deeply
within our societies, our international
[SPEAKER_01]: society stigma against THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to really be a bit more open
to this and realize where we're coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from and look at this more objectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like true medical practitioners and true
scientists should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to share the link to that
article if you've got corresponding notes
[SPEAKER_01]: to this podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave it down at the link for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching the show, you'll see it
down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan, thank you very much for coming on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've hit our time, but I could talk to
you all day on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure to talk to
you and hope we get you on and we can talk
[SPEAKER_00]: again further on the topic in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk forever on this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the viewers would have gotten
as much wealth of information out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, guys.
Thank you very much.
