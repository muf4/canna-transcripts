[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the Cannabis
View.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by a man who's creating a great
[SPEAKER_01]: drink over in Helsinki.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Petri Nylanden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how you spell it, Petri?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we were saying just before the break,
the aim is to try and bring ourselves a
[SPEAKER_01]: European industry together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And connect with as many people as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start with everybody and just
tell everybody what it is that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and how you got from a competitive
pro sports to a CBD drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really interesting times to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ventures and this business at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my two sided background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the professional sports and after
that in the business world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started my working career in
Red Bull.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like the place where I
got brainwashed for the beverage industry
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get excited about the consumer
brands and then cool stuff they are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years, a little bit side steps to
sales and marketing roles in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2018, I started to be as a full-time
entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And end of 2018, we launched our first
beverage brand, which has at first nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with hemp or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was on the product development
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were pitching that venture to one
investor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another founder of Usub,
Veli-Pekka Pello was also pitching his
[SPEAKER_00]: ventures to the same investor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the investor built a bridge between us
and we started discussions and planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shared the same vision about things and
then everything clicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started the new company and then
started to create the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get on to the first topic of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the world of CBD beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see this at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: We obviously know there's a couple of big,
big players that are coming to the fore in
[SPEAKER_01]: America like Kilcliffe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over here, you see as we were talking
about, there's a couple of brands coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Ireland and the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see other big players in Europe
that are coming to the fore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think you guys have a nice,
exact target demographic that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to pitch your drink to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is a lot of players getting
huge traction in the US side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think their home market is that big
that they are focusing on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to do in the US side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the market is the most developed
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the UK, but not too much actions in EU
countries, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's obviously because of the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel that we have a good thing going on
since we are focusing more on the category
[SPEAKER_00]: of scent rings and the functional and
experiential brand of the scent rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are not too tied to the CBD
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already have our first product out,
which is CBD free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are still 100% CBD brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the competitive advantage we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no time to do our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's see what the regulation
thing will be, what the schedule will be
[SPEAKER_00]: in EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the time is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really kind of know what is happening
in what time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the drinks market?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a big huge future for the nootropics
style drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think CBD and a lot of the
cannabinoids and terpenes even in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future are going to play a big part in the
range of products that will be available
[SPEAKER_01]: to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that you guys are
keeping your eye on as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it going to be laser focused on the
CBD industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we see it as just the one regular
functional ingredient for food and
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage, the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look around with all the
ingredient innovations and the new things
[SPEAKER_00]: which are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cannabis or outside cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to be innovative in a way how we
check out the product development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I think now the timing is great
for focusing a little bit to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the regulation comes a little bit
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's time to focus on the CBD and
then later on to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really supports our brand and our
functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of good things coming innovation
side in ingredients and in technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are supporting these type of
beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of leads me on to the next topic I
wanted to talk about, and it's sport and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: From somebody who's an ex-pro sport
athlete, I think this is, as you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are focused on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only at the tip of the market when
it really comes to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see CBD being an ingredient for a whole
host of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree that within 24 months we're
going to see some of the biggest sports
[SPEAKER_01]: stars in Europe being sponsored by various
different CBD brands?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If and when the regulation is clear and
steady, I believe it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come more normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think CBD brands will act like
any other consumer brands and then linking
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves to the persons who are
representing the same values and then
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been checking out a little bit of the
side of how anti-doping agency will check
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have understood correctly,
CBD is not prohibited by the agency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have to be really careful which
products you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no DHE or any other prohibited
ingredients in the products you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it will be pretty common
since CBD use is supporting sports and
[SPEAKER_00]: athletes heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think you see there's a huge
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got that Dr. MD or the CBD company
over at the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of them sponsoring big,
huge athletes at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think once we get the regulations in
place here, the extraction method should
[SPEAKER_01]: be allowed for a sports athlete to consume
this without having any remote hesitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me this and tell me more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go on to the next topic that
I wanted to talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this industry ideal for the
entrepreneurial mentality?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an ex pro sports coach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand the training that's
involved, how much kind of you're pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself on your own steam, as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody coming to you in the
cannabis industry with a manual to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the steps you need to take to be
able to do X, Y and Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of entrepreneurs, you bury down
one tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that doesn't work, you come back,
you go down another tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does work, you make the tunnel
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that the cannabis industry is
actually going to attract some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: brightest and best over the next decade?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ideal at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will be more ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, there is a significant
regulation and legal risk still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of people are avoiding
that risk still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of uncertainty,
a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do a lot of work, a lot of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to figure it out, like you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that entrepreneurial mentality
and the mindset to navigate in that type
[SPEAKER_00]: of business environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe personally that my sports
background is supporting and will support
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of these people who thrives on 14,
16-hour days.
[SPEAKER_01]: God help you if you're going up against
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabis industry,
again, it's suiting a lot of people down
[SPEAKER_01]: to a tee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's so much to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're one of these people who's
hungry for knowledge and making
[SPEAKER_01]: connections like we're doing today,
then there's so many connections to make
[SPEAKER_01]: and so much to learn that you've got a
good couple of years of tiring yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: out with all the information that's out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been over to North America at all
and seen some of the setups over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have you guys just focused on specific,
as you said, you've got expertise in the
[SPEAKER_01]: drink beverage world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have you been over and seen some of the
competitors over in North America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the past year, obviously,
because of all the travel bans.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the team members were visiting or
tried to visit the previous Expo West,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, I haven't been there now
for three years since I was in the States
[SPEAKER_00]: previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not too familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully, the travel bans will go
away and we are able to travel more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, we need to head to the US
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think everybody, there's going to
be a hell of a year or two of travel when
[SPEAKER_01]: this is all over and done with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a list to lend to my arm of
things that I need to smoke and drink and
[SPEAKER_01]: eat over the next 12 to 24 months as soon
as I get out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, well, what's the industry like
for you guys over in Helsinki?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found that they're complying with
the European regulations that got passed
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2019?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you still think over in Ireland,
there's still enacted laws from the 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but by the looks of things, they haven't
caught up with Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it like for you guys selling CBD
products over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you buy CBD flour in Helsinki?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any dispensaries that are selling
CBD flour yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Finland actually considers CBD as a
prescription drug at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, really, really limited how
you can buy and then use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's actually a little bit
against the ruling which the Court of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice from EU gave end of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge stigma around the whole
cannabis and old-fashioned legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Finland, it actually goes also in
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there was actually one article
in the past weekend that does like a
[SPEAKER_00]: general pension fund, which is investing
people's money for the pension things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like 63% of the people
in Finland said that there's no way we
[SPEAKER_00]: want our money to be invested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only 30% said that it's not cool to
invest in alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alcohol is really, really fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Considered as a sustainable investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invest those companies and then
cannabis is seen like an illegal criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stigma we need to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we try to be really active,
discussing in different channels and then
[SPEAKER_00]: educating people that this is actually a
pretty legit thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called legal cannabis industry
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a legal in front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's really big business in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should consider it that way also
here in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are behind what comes to regulation
and development and then the stigma is
[SPEAKER_00]: real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully now these conversations,
I'm going to have a good few more with
[SPEAKER_01]: people around Europe that will be able to
coalesce together and create a unified
[SPEAKER_01]: group that can basically fund campaigns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the one thing I've noticed around
the world is there is money funding
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-cannabis campaigns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it comes from and all that kind of
stuff is another issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is most certainly money behind
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the whole industry need to get
together and start, as opposed to just
[SPEAKER_01]: telling everybody this is a miracle plant,
doing proper kind of advertising campaigns
[SPEAKER_01]: and marketing campaigns and putting
somebody who's sick, who's getting this
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, as opposed to the cool people
trying to say, oh, 420 is where it should
[SPEAKER_01]: be legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be putting somebody having
shivering panic attacks on an ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then CBD oil is the one thing that
stops them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think you need to play fire with
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this stage, but it's great to see you
guys doing your great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope we're going to be able to chat
again over the next couple of months and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep in contact and build this
relationship as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we like networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to share our things, our contacts,
if we can help in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we are approachable guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody just can contact us on
LinkedIn or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope that some bigger
countries and universities take the
[SPEAKER_00]: research thing seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I think there's a lot of research
going on around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's communicated through the
industry channels, it's not so credible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the countries and governments and
the big universities are communicating the
[SPEAKER_00]: research results, it's credible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research and development and good
financial reports are what we need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to convince people who don't have a
clue what they're talking about in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, there's not much money we can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many jobs we can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how safe it is according to
the most stringent tests we've been able
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody who wants to check out about
YSUB drinks, it's busy backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check the guys out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drinks look amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I very much look forward to chatting to
you in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm in Helsinki meeting up and
hopefully having a taste of the drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much for taking part in the
show, Patrick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
