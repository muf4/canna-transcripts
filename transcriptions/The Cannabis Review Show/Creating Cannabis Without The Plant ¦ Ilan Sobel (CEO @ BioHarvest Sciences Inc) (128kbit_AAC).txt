[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the first episode of
the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're delighted to be joined by a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking forward to talking for a
long time, one of the biggest players in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world at the moment, Ilan Sobel,
who's the CEO of a company called Bio
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bio Harvest, basically Bio Harvest
Sciences Inc, should I say, are the first
[SPEAKER_00]: and only fully validated industrial scale
plant cell technology platform for the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of plant metabolizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm correct, they've recently created
cannabis trichomes in their proprietary
[SPEAKER_00]: reactors that have resulted in 100 to 200
X times greater density of trichomes than
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big player in the world at the
moment, Ilan, I'm delighted to have you on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an absolute pleasure, Owen,
to be here on your first show of 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is it, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to start with a bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year seemed to be the kind of a big
movement of pharma industry into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all the diehard cannabis players
out there who are bemoaning pharmacy
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into this, this is what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational would be the genetics
growers, the tenders, the bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a separate industry now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pharmaceuticals will create bespoke
medicines for bespoke diseases that can't
[SPEAKER_00]: be replicated with a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might as well get used to it and get
talking to the biggest players in the game
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment, Ilan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, can you maybe give everybody
an overview of how you came from Coca-Cola
[SPEAKER_00]: into Bio Harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, firstly, I'm very privileged to be
CEO of Bio Harvest Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an amazing 18-month journey in
this role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the best 18 months of my
professional career.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my experience actually set me up
beautifully for the challenges,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dynamic challenge that I have ahead in
this role.
[SPEAKER_01]: With 18 years as an international employee
of the Coca-Cola company, having spent
[SPEAKER_01]: that across multiple different
geographies, 12 years in Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: three years in Africa, and three and a
half years in the US in multiple general
[SPEAKER_01]: management roles, understanding the
business end-to-end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a really good understanding of
the food and beverage business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I moved to Israel in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And went into the startup world,
and together with two partners,
[SPEAKER_01]: built a big data IoT and software business
in the beer industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after building a business with all the
major beer players as our customers with
[SPEAKER_01]: Heineken, Carlsberg, and Hauser-Busch
InBev, we were very fortunate to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: do a significant exit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sold the business to Hauser-Busch
InBev and became a major big data
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics player for the Hauser-Busch
InBev system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that background and knowledge in
the food and beverage industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also having worked at my time in
Coca-Cola in really building a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: health and wellness brands, I actually
came to BioHarvest Sciences as an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after completing a very intensive due
diligence on the company, I realized,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, this company is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a gold mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got technology, which is like a
needle in a haystack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is super unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's able to bring the power of the plant
to the people with a very unique
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary platform technology,
which has the ability to grow any primary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any protein or any secondary
metabolite, such as a polyphenol,
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidant, or in fact, what we're going
to talk about today, cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're able to grow any primary
metabolite or secondary metabolite from
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any essential active ingredients that
plants have, we're able to grow in cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over time, we grow these cells in
bioreactors to give us an amazingly
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble and bioavailable end product with
fantastic efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I came in as an investor,
I thought, wow, this company is really
[SPEAKER_01]: unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I invested and I drove the existing
CEO who's now the chairman so crazy during
[SPEAKER_01]: my due diligence process that once my
check had actually passed through the
[SPEAKER_01]: bank, he called me back up and said,
listen, I realized through this process
[SPEAKER_01]: you put us through that I need a
professional CEO to come and run this
[SPEAKER_01]: business and to bring the power of our
technology to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like you to be that professional
CEO to come and run the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am 18 months later, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've achieved so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're certainly creating history as it
relates to the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: At its core, we're a biotech company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the leaders in plant cell
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're unlocking the secrets of cellular
plant biology every single day,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing unique health and wellness and
therapeutic solutions to thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a very exciting company to
be a part of in both aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, through my research, I realized you
guys got started in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017, you got your R&D license from the
Israeli government.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018 is when you do cells to grow and
produce trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the big milestone that happened
last year that all the press was about?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could break it down simply for the
audience that you were able to create
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome biomass, obviously in a reactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does that mean for the regular
consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, so there were a number of
historical milestones that happened in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to say we pretty much climbed
Mount Everest and back six times,
[SPEAKER_01]: just given the fact that we've been
pioneers in this area and we've gone where
[SPEAKER_01]: no person has gone before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, right now there's
absolutely there's no literature out there
[SPEAKER_01]: as it relates to actually growing cells,
cannabis cells in bioreactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no academic institution out there
that has or other business that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do what we've been able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the major milestone that we
were able to demonstrate was the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually grow the trichomes in
bioreactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as many of the audience obviously
know, the trichome is the mini factory
[SPEAKER_01]: that produces the cannabinoids,
flavonoids, and terpenes and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: stores those critical active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to figure out how we take
the plant once, we then grow cells from
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we actually take those cells and
put those cells into liquid media,
[SPEAKER_01]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: bioreactors, we were able to actually grow
from each of our cells those very unique
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a major feat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It created biotech history.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as, you know, cannabis history,
because no other company has been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow trichomes in liquid media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then had another major breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously this is all part of our
unique IP, is that we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow our trichomes in a very,
very unique structure, which we call a
[SPEAKER_01]: amalgamated trichome coral structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a real genius breakthrough from a
science perspective, because as you are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, as you are scaling products in
bioreactors, and as your bioreactors get
[SPEAKER_01]: larger and larger, you have what they call
shear forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without amalgamated trichome coral
structures, what actually landed happening
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we were able to get the actual
trichomes to all amalgamate closely
[SPEAKER_01]: together to create somewhat what you can
see when you look at it like a coral
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, which actually protects the
trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a real breakthrough because
it allows us to actually go from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, small bioreactors to medium
bioreactors to, you know, really
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial scale bioreactors in a way that
protects the unique integrity of that
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome, which is so important because
it's the it's the many factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the second breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this breakthrough, we announced
to the markets at the end of the at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of last year on December 8th that we
actually have now been able to grow kilos
[SPEAKER_01]: of final finished biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important, Owen,
for you and the audience to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that what we are growing is full spectrum,
non GMO biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that was, again, another major
milestone that we announced the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace that we're the first company
in the world to be able to grow full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, non GMO cannabis biomass and
specifically at the quantities that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We announced that we had grown roughly 10
kilos of the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that no other
company or institution has been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's important about this is that as
a result of our technology, this allows us
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to bring a unique grade of
cannabis to the marketplace, which we will
[SPEAKER_01]: be bringing in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the uniqueness is derived by a number
of different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first area is its finger brick
consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which is so important in the cannabis
world, specifically from a medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, we have a level of
cleanliness, which is unique to the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace because we literally we
started the plant once.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so therefore and we're growing cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no need for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a very unique clean product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you now, our receptors in
our bodies, they understand the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between clean product and unclean product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then thirdly, sustainability is at the
core of our platform technology that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing to grow our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, obviously, we're able to
grow cannabis at it with a fraction of the
[SPEAKER_01]: of the actual amount of land that's
required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even compared to indoor indoor growing,
we're also able to do it much more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a perpetual flowering process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And importantly, because we're not
utilizing any pesticides, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, there's no solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the water that we use is actually
biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from an environmental perspective,
this is a very unique platform technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: which gives us, I would say, best in class
credentials from a sustainability
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective as it relates to the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some major, major milestones that
obviously we're excited now to build on as
[SPEAKER_01]: we start to scale for 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it all sounds incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me, do you guys get to set,
let's say, the recipe for the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that are grown within the trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the secondary question, do those
trichomes grow into actual flower or are
[SPEAKER_00]: they kept in the lab and used as an
ingredient, just to clarify for the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, we start with the plant and
based on the genetics of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're obviously growing those same
genetics of the plant from an overall
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profile perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it relates to the actual final biomass,
we're growing trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in fact, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety three percent of our biomass is
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked about the density,
how we're actually able to grow trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: with on average between one hundred and
two hundred times more density than what
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grown on a regular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that is because of the structure
that we have and just unique confirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also drives significant overall
efficiencies for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, we have, you know,
as part of our biomass, you have roughly a
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio of ninety three percent trichome,
which is really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other seven percent is the cell,
which is the starting point to grow the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with that biomass, we can take
that and utilize that biomass just like
[SPEAKER_01]: you can typically utilize any type of
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can decide to take it and do extraction
and go into oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can decide to actually take it in
itself and go into edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be utilized, you know, basically as
regular cannabis to be consumed from a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal perspective with different types
of formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has the exact same versatility that
existing cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, what's important to
understand is that we're all all trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: or 93 percent trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all the the factory of
production of cannabinoids are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of synthetic versus the
methodology that you guys are using,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it chalk and cheese or is it just you
guys are far more purified when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the actual ingredient that's going into
products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I think it's important that for your
viewers, they understand the differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between a biosynthesis right, which is
obviously, you know, but you have
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic, you have biosynthesis,
which is basically utilizing mold or fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow the kind of the actual singular
cannabinoids versus ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously, you can group
synthetic and biosynthesis together,
[SPEAKER_01]: largely driven by the fact that these are
obviously genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we are non GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like the first major
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second major difference between,
let's say, these two groups is
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis and synthetic are always
going to be using singular isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so it's CBD or CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and this is really a critical
component of our technology platform is
[SPEAKER_01]: around its ability to be able to grow full
spectrum of the different active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really important because,
you know, when you look at a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different scientific studies, the human
body always reacts better to what they
[SPEAKER_01]: call the entourage effect or the
systematic effect, where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple, you know, multiple polyphenols,
as in the case of our veneer product that
[SPEAKER_01]: we already where we already have strong
validation of our platform technology with
[SPEAKER_01]: selling our red grape cell product in the
cardiovascular health space with veneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have parcyid resveratrol with
only company in the world that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: produces parcyid resveratrol from the skin
of the red grape, which has a glucoside,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has amazing solubility, but it works
in unison together with other critical
[SPEAKER_01]: polyphenols like catagen, coercetin,
anthocyanins and tannins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that harmonious effect which
creates the best outcome from an overall
[SPEAKER_01]: health and wellness perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, with cannabis, there's a lot of
research on the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it the synergistic
effect, which talks about the importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of the different cannabinoids working
together with the terpenes and flavonoids
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to give you the best possible
outcome from an overall effectiveness
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think about it like an
orchestra.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have multiple different
components of the orchestra working
[SPEAKER_01]: together to give you the best overall
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing in the plant world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have all the different active
ingredients working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way that God gave us the
plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a this is a major, major
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, you know, you opened the
discussion talking about the pharma world
[SPEAKER_01]: and the pharma world, you know,
having woken up with Pfizer, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing six point seven billion
dollars, purchasing a company that has
[SPEAKER_01]: strong cannabis, cannabis knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a major move from pharma who've
gone from the synthetic world.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, they're coming back full
circle now to the plant world and
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing, you know, obviously the power
of botanicals in its full spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: in its full spectrum composition in order
to help solve some of the major palliative
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases and indications that today
specific synthesized pharma drugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very challenged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very challenge in helping to
solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why today in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: you have between 45 million people at
least that are today consuming medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as either total substitutes or in
addition to their current, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, pharma grade synthesized
medication for anything from fibromyalgia,
[SPEAKER_01]: ALS, cancer medication, epilepsy
medication, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, really interesting times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pfizer, I think, took a bold, you know,
audacious decision to actually start to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the original source of where the pharma
world started, which is the plant and back
[SPEAKER_01]: to botanicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I recently saw that they
have a medicine that specializes in
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular disease, I think was the
cherry on the cake for Pfizer acquiring
[SPEAKER_00]: that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could talk to you all day and I
swear to God, I'm absolutely sold on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an enthralling shot and I hope
we get to chat again before the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year and get an update on everything you
guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody who wants to know more,
check out the website for bio-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: sciences below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend doing some research on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ilan, thank you again, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the opportunity, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day and we'll chat in the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
