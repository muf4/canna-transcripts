[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by a real powerhouse of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, George Jage, who's the
co-founder and CEO of Jage Media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jage Media produces MJ Unpacked,
which is a leading CBG consumer packaged
[SPEAKER_00]: goods trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also publish MJ Brand Insights,
which provides up to minute industry
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence and in-depth research.
[SPEAKER_00]: George also served as the CEO of Dome,
Media and led its acquisition of Hightime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're delighted to have you on the
show, George.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and thank you so much for having me
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to basically start off with
the first kind of question that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically saw, oversaw the acquisition
of Hightime.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes a good cannabis acquisition in
the media space, in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes it a good space in Europe
or in just in the media space in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: The media space in general, is it consumer
content?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to give a little background,
Owen, you know, I've been doing trade
[SPEAKER_01]: shows for about 30 years, mostly focused
on business to business.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came into cannabis space,
I basically took over as the president of
[SPEAKER_01]: MJ Biz Con and MJ Biz Daily, which was a
B2B and became the largest one under my
[SPEAKER_01]: tenure.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I left there, though, I had an
opportunity to kind of step in the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer media space and Dope Magazine had
built a really phenomenal brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the fact that I don't know if
anybody had figured out the consumer media
[SPEAKER_01]: model in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of assets out there with a
lot of hope and promise of becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable and sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you know, when I stepped
into the opportunity to Dope Magazine,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really needed to raise some more money
and there wasn't a lot of capital out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had looked at a couple of different
acquisition opportunities, had a deal done
[SPEAKER_01]: with a different company that kind of
changed their mind at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Hightime was a good fit for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were looking to make a number of
acquisitions and really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reinvigorate the Hightime brand that had a
lot of legacy support in the industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of make it, you know,
probably one of the most recognizable
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis brands in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after that acquisition,
I left my tenure at Dope slash Hightime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I think that the cannabis,
the consumer media space and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lack of really, I think,
some meaningful events out there that can
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know, engage with consumers
for allow them to explore the category.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, almost every one of these media
companies has, you know, a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have print, they have digital,
they have events, you know, and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just talked to Ramamayo the other day
and, you know, they just held their first
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Street Festival out in Los Angeles
really as as a bridge to from the
[SPEAKER_01]: business, the business side to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Street owns a building in Los
Angeles that hosts a kind of a shared
[SPEAKER_01]: co-working space, as well as a number of
brands that utilize that as kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: California outpost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the festival is really designed to
allow people to engage the category and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of discover the new form factors that
are coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a fast and rapidly changing
category, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in the media space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, you know, there's there's been
a lot of consumer media assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody's figured out the magic formula
to make it sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you're right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first wave of information had
to be B2B because everybody needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the information of how to
create the laws, accounts and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances that go with the business side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you're starting to see
consolidation of a number of brands such
[SPEAKER_00]: as cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of platforms over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's start to switch now
towards hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to start capturing the consumer's
attention now because that's who we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually all trying to sell the brands to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of this kind of segues
really close into why we launched MJ
[SPEAKER_01]: Unpacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to kind of circle back on the
consumer, which is really the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really the hero in the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we when you say that B2B had to
be the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I took over at MJ BizCon at the
time, they did 20 tabletop trade show at a
[SPEAKER_01]: racetrack because there wasn't really a
lot of venues saying, hey, come on in and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of stigma associated with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of concern around,
you know, what kind of behavior would
[SPEAKER_01]: happen at these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were able to successfully hold a
couple of very small conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to come in and help them
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only way that you could do an
event back then was really to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: supply side event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, you know, the the people who
were acquiring the licenses, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what does a retail store look
like, what does a cultivation operation
[SPEAKER_01]: look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it was extraction
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was lighting, you know, lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was POS technology, it was label
makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and there was a number of events that
kind of all of a sudden popped onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this huge surge of supply
side events.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, let's let's be
real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a consumer packaged goods very
much like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, going to get a Guinness or
you're going to get a cookies right at
[SPEAKER_01]: your local pub, hopefully someday down the
road in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and they're really, you know,
if you look at the business to business
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the media space, usually the most
powerful and important trade show in the
[SPEAKER_01]: CPG industries is a brand or retail focus
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there did one didn't exist because we
don't have a national market here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States because of the complex legal
system that's kind of bifurcated between
[SPEAKER_01]: state and federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our goal is really is like,
let's let's be honest, like the brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: the retailer are the last kind of
interchange and they kind of have a shared
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility to win over that consumer
of creating a safe and friendly and
[SPEAKER_01]: educational retail environment that a
consumer can come in and explore category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people may be never have used
cannabis before or they maybe haven't used
[SPEAKER_01]: it for a couple of decades and to
reintroduce them to the category.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the brand has to create a product
that's tested, it's trusted, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: transparent that delivers on the
experience that the consumer is expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we obviously saw that,
you know, in the early stages of the
[SPEAKER_01]: market, there was kind of this rush to
bathtub gin, so to speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 milligram candy bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people didn't know better and would
over consume that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, we still have a perfect track
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has died from a cannabis overdose
to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there but there is danger,
obviously psychologically to somebody over
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming cannabis that can be very
traumatic for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to be mindful that we need to
kind of really manage that consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: journey through the category to win them
over as a category consumer, not just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have a one and done experience
because they got too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rate stuff like the race to
the high THC content is the complete wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: direction for what the consumer is
actually going to want to want when they
[SPEAKER_00]: have full choice going state from state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even over in Germany, you're going to see
it legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're going to see a lot of
North American companies planning that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have Germany all to
themselves, whereas we already know of a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge amount of European companies who are
already going to be putting up a fight for
[SPEAKER_00]: market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move on now to your MJ Unpacked,
your consumer packaged goods trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did your inaugural event in 2020,
if I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just October, just before COVID kicked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually founded the company back at
the tail end of 2019 and we raised some
[SPEAKER_01]: capital to fund it in February of 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when I kind of look back at
our journey, you know, I basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we we got the money in just at
the buzzer because I don't think anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: would have given us a dime to fund this
enterprise in March and the economy shut
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did do a number of virtual events and
from a trade standpoint, especially for a
[SPEAKER_01]: very tactile industry like cannabis,
you want to be able to touch taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: feel, you need to be able to be in the
same room with somebody that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do business with to kind of read their
body language and build a level of trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and virtual events just don't fit that
bill very well for cannabis and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: other industries in the tech space are
great because it's very, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of technical and transactional.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for cannabis, it's very relational and
it's important that people get together
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of, you know, celebrate the
industry, but also be in the room with the
[SPEAKER_01]: right people.
[SPEAKER_01]: With M.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unpacked, one of the things that we did
different than any other trade show in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States is we actually qualify every
single one of our attendees to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're a retail or a brand CPG brand
company with the title of manager hire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're immediately screening to make
sure that everybody in the room is a
[SPEAKER_01]: decision maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that, you know, one of the
big challenges here in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: is access to capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also allow an accredited investors
who are actively investing in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're looking for intent potential
not just somebody that might have a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of hundred shares of cureleaf in their
trade portfolio, but somebody who could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually write a check, you know,
until we have access to safe banking and
[SPEAKER_01]: normalize, you know, the financial markets
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to continue to be a
choke point for our industry's growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we spoke to the guys, green check
verified in New York, Peter Sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there seems to be a couple of
solutions coming for the banking sector
[SPEAKER_00]: just around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that New York industry is
going to propel the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: industry on by a huge margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even myself, I was over there two
weeks ago and the cannabis was prevalent
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere from the lands on Fifth Avenue
to the CV stores selling THC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the consumer tourism over there,
people are underestimating how many
[SPEAKER_00]: Europeans I think are going to travel to
Europe or to New York for a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can travel to Boston right now for
a cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly a little bit closer than
New York for traveling across the pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's interesting because
[SPEAKER_01]: on one side, yes, in New York,
it's kind of this very kind of libertarian
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of mentality living in a big city
like that, that you kind of as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not infringing on your personal
space or rights, then let them be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we did our show in New York just
this past May, I mean, people are outside
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke cannabis legally at any
place that you're allowed to smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: So restaurants have outdoor patios.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go up and light up a joint and go
have your meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do agree with you that New York,
because of its weight and its influence in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, might accelerate some type of
safe banking solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other side of it, we say it's
right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been saying that for almost 10 years
now in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, and I know that you have a
lot of very intelligent listeners to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, American politics have become
blood sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've allowed corporate interests to
influence our politics to a degree and a
[SPEAKER_01]: level that is dangerous for democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that someday we repeal the Citizens
United.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have career politicians that are,
you know, it's it's I was listening to a
[SPEAKER_01]: program the other day that on average,
like 95 percent of our senators and
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives will get reelected because
it's just there's that much influence for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to be able to beef up their campaign
coffers versus a non incumbent thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's problematic for
democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, hopefully we this great
experiment will figure it out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing I wanted to touch on was the M
.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon insights that you guys do.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that it's probably a pet
peeve of mine over in Europe here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of reports that I see that
Europe is going to be worth 50 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is going to be worth 10 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you bring real truth and insight
and analysis to to hypothetical markets
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not have happened yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you set parameters for you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because over here, some of the companies
that do it don't really seem to it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be all one sided.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to write all the fluffy
stuff, whereas I think it has to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: nuanced than that for real investors to
have a look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so M.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon insights we actually just
rebranded as M.J.B.I.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a strategic partnership with a
company called BDSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are one of the leading analytics
firms in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and going back to that,
I mean, everybody, you know, any publisher
[SPEAKER_01]: or data analyst is going to want to come
up with some hyperbolic future number of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the market's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bigger that number is,
the more likely that they're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: press coverage on that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's somewhat of a function of
sensationalized news that that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: fallen in a trap as opposed to,
you know, critical thinking and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pure journalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what we're trying to do is,
again, is differentiate ourselves from the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of oversaturated like, hey,
let's post news stories that are basically
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled from news feeds, you know,
about this this happening or this company,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, launching this product,
but really kind of, you know, have more of
[SPEAKER_01]: a conversational approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a strategic partnership with
a company called Pioneer Intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They measure consumer activity based on
three pillars, social media, website
[SPEAKER_01]: traffic and earn media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they can kind of see which brands
are trending up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting more hits on their on
their social media posts, on their website
[SPEAKER_01]: and tie that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if somebody from the company is,
you know, can look at saying, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: we ran this marketing promotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw this big uptick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's run that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't happen, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't we don't do that type of
market analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do do is we cover brands that are
creating innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at, you know, social equity owned
brands, women owned brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really try to cover the
underrepresented voices in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, while the MSOs in the space
get, you know, suck up a lot of oxygen and
[SPEAKER_01]: news channels, it's really innovation
really happens at the kind of small
[SPEAKER_01]: business level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, you know, you have a very serial
entrepreneur trying to differentiate
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the stories we want to see
get lifted up, get get attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, going back, I know that,
you know, the American market is very
[SPEAKER_01]: nuanced compared to what's going to happen
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point in time, there's going
to be a moment where we federally legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alcohol and tobacco companies have
business plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have operational capital set aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some really smart people and
they're going to try to steamroll this
[SPEAKER_01]: entire industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would be a shame if the
cannabis industry lost some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation that happens at the grassroots
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly is that we lost
control of the thought leadership of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because we deserve a better
industry that's more compassionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't an intoxicant and really help
help support the growth of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Europe legalizes, is there a brand
in North America, Canada or the USA that
[SPEAKER_00]: you think has the best chance of getting
in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the largest brand in the
world might not yet have been invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certainly some powerhouses here
in the U.S., like we had talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: before, the Cookies, Curly, Select,
Juana brands that have some potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think the European market
is going to be very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that European brands are going
to have the opportunity to really own that
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's very nuanced over here when you
get over here and the ability to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to penetrate the whole of Europe with one
brand and one narrative and one message is
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a misplaced idea,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got we've got all these bifurcated
state markets here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in Europe, you know, regardless of
the EU, you do have very unique cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of nuances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I'm excited to see what's
going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't thank you enough for taking your
time to talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody wants to check out more about GH
Media?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just on the link below to be
connected to the link in each platform
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're watching on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for your time,
George.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to chat again in the near
future and get an update of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
Oh.
Oh.
