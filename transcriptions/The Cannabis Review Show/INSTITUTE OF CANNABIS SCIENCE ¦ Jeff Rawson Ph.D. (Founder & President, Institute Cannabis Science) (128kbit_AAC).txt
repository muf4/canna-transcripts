[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Jeff Rawson, who's the founder and
[SPEAKER_01]: president of the Institute of Cannabis
Science over in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking the time to
do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a busy man at the moment,
everybody coming out to the left,
[SPEAKER_01]: right and center.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of interest right now in this
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there most certainly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give everybody in like under
60 seconds an overview of how you decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to set up the Institute of Cannabis
Science and what the main objective that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking to achieve is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the Institute of Cannabis Science
exists to do research that benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, my concern that led me to
found the Institute was the misinformation
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, many products are not labeled
accurately and sometimes safety tests
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't even been performed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this comes down to the fact
that third party labs provide the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cultivators and producers who then
sell the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes these third party labs
themselves can be dishonest and the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers will shop for the lab that gives
them the best answer the producer wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that problem is called lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common challenge in regulatory
science and we need nonprofits and other
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations to engage in order to get
regulators to fix the problems and in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to bring the scrutiny necessary so
that we all have honest data about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we give everybody a quick little
overview?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is science?
[SPEAKER_01]: Science is the measurement of different
elements in the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I think that science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science always starts with a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So science is about making measurements
and understanding a given property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we examine some physical property
or something that we notice around us in
[SPEAKER_00]: the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then typically we try to measure it or
quantify it in some way that usually
[SPEAKER_00]: involves making a number.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we figure out how to measure it
and observe it, like, say, the brightness
[SPEAKER_00]: of light in a room and put a number to it,
then we can use that information and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw some insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the goal is to start with
making a measurement, interpret the
[SPEAKER_00]: information, maybe make a range of
measurements over some space and then come
[SPEAKER_00]: away with an insight or real
understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the main way of measuring
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main way of measuring cannabis and
usually when we're measuring cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're asking about is what are the
main compounds that are in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of us know that
tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main drug-like compound in cannabis,
although there are a lot of other active
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to know how much THC is in my
cannabis flower, well, I can't just look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to actually take that cannabis
flower and soak it in some liquid until
[SPEAKER_00]: all the THC comes out into the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take up that liquid and I
measure it very carefully to see exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how much THC is dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I know the mass of the flower that
I started with, I know how much THC was in
[SPEAKER_00]: that given mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a useful thing that usually
comes out as a percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and some of the stuff that we're
seeing, obviously, in the moment is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically certain THC levels being stated
at a certain number and it being actually
[SPEAKER_01]: a different number.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time it gets to the shelves,
is the issue happening at their testing
[SPEAKER_01]: the minute it's cultivated and it then has
to go through a number of processes like
[SPEAKER_01]: machinery that could devalue the THC or
the cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just lazy management at a
cultivation level?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question,
because actually, you know, this this one
[SPEAKER_00]: buzzword THC inflation is probably a
couple of different regulatory problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that one thing that does happen
is that some labs find they have an
[SPEAKER_00]: economic incentive to provide numbers that
are a little bit larger than their
[SPEAKER_00]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do believe that sometimes there
is deliberate fraud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also a lot of the problem that we have
specifically in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is also true in other states,
but the regulations are different in each
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exact nature of the problems vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Massachusetts, we have poor
definitions for what counts as cured flour
[SPEAKER_00]: or dried flour and the reporting basis for
cannabinoid compounds and whether that's
[SPEAKER_00]: by dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that comes down to is the amount
of water in the cannabis flour at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: of testing is not specified by the
regulations and a significant amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: the weight of the cannabis flour comes
from water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the if the flour could be wetter or
drier, but the rules don't say exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what moisture content I'm testing at,
then I actually don't I don't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the concentration means because I
don't know the total weight of the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: that was tested and how to compare that
with the flour I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the problem is bad definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another challenge is that the THC in
cannabis flour is not mostly actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: compound THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly present as a precursor
compound called tetrahydrocannabinolic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's upon heating that compound that
it gets converted into THC in the process
[SPEAKER_00]: of smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the differences in definitions of
compounds make the differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual compounds that are present make it
difficult to say clearly what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I look at a label that tells me a
THC percent, I need more information to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what that number really signifies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that also sometimes
degradation of cannabinoids can happen
[SPEAKER_00]: after packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't believe that that's often a
big problem because most packages of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flour don't sit around for years
before they get sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it generally generally the flour,
once it's packaged, is in the darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not exposed to light, which tends
to catalyze these reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also kept pretty cool,
like at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there were significant decomposition
of cannabinoid compounds, we would see
[SPEAKER_00]: that in our testing because we would see
elevated levels of cannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the spike in CBN would be able to
tell if the degradation has happened at
[SPEAKER_01]: that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me this, in the compliance side of
things, that third party testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this stuff enforced or are they more
incentivized to have the big client,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes sir, no sir, three bags full,
sir, we'll be able to get the level that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there strict rules in any of the
states where it's legalized, where the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: testing and the protocol is actually very
regimented and you can, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: boost it up by an extra 5% to THC just
because you're going to get a 24-month
[SPEAKER_01]: contract?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's another good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better structured regulations are
definitely more enforceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to some degree, the problem that we
have really comes from dishonest behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a behavior problem and a problem
of incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, this yes sir, no sir,
three bags full, that lab is serving the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cultivator is their client,
their customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in America, at least, we always say
the customer is always right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lab is doing good business if they
give their customer exactly what their
[SPEAKER_00]: customer asks for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if their customer calls up the lab,
every time they get in a number they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like and say, could you please retest
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's more THC in my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the lab has to do that retest,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand the pressures that people
are under.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find that there's usually like two
out of 10 labs that everyone knows in a
[SPEAKER_00]: given state are producing bad results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those labs usually do pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it a case of basically there's no
federal legalization, so therefore there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no standard testing agency like an FDA or
something like that that's going around to
[SPEAKER_01]: every expense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do they already exist in the relative
states?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can't cope with the quantity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, each state has been tasked with
coming up with its own regulatory and
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why the results are so
different in each state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a more standardized approach,
usually the federal government and federal
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies are much more proactive with
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely in the state of
Massachusetts, our regulatory agency has
[SPEAKER_00]: struggled to figure out what constitutes
an effective action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely improvements in the rules
and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I founded the Institute of
Cannabis Science is because a nonprofit
[SPEAKER_00]: that what we do is we're a nonprofit
nonprofit and we we test products off the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves ourselves and then provide
information to people about what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, we kind of short circuit the
whole usual process that you would wait
[SPEAKER_00]: for and provide answers right away and
fill in some of that gap that's left by a
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of federal enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, moving on to the medical side of the
cannabis industry, is the future of the
[SPEAKER_01]: over in Europe, I think we have a lot
stricter rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharma companies are ingrained in a
lot of the kind of cosmetic ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: and food and beverage type ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see in within 10 years time that
like 60 or 70 percent of this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: from cosmetics to food and beverage,
those molecule ingredients are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from, let's say, three or four major
companies that have either perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis or do you always think that
there's going to be room for a cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: flour and the environmental impact and the
capital extensive outlay that goes with
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is that is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of different thoughts
about that, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of edibles and beverages,
right, those kinds of cannabis products
[SPEAKER_00]: are they fit a lot closer with standard
consumer packaged goods and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the production of those, it's
companies are finding pretty good success
[SPEAKER_00]: at at being national leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, you know, there are now like a
lot of beverage companies for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that are pretty new within the last couple
of years that are actually they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: buying their cannabinoid, their
cannabinoid emulsion, right, because
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid compounds actually have
terrible solubility in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just making an emulsion that's
dissolved in water is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a company called Vertosa
that makes cannabinoid emulsion in many
[SPEAKER_00]: states, and they sell their cannabinoid
emulsion to many different beverage
[SPEAKER_00]: makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're already seeing that some parts of
the supply chain, the commodity parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply chain are firming up and being
dominated by individual brands in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that that will continue to
happen with beverages and edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a large part of the cannabis
consuming community that is very partial
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to stop any time soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing flour is a totally different
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like making Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not not really as much of a chemical
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that there will continue to
be a robust sector producing craft
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that there will also be a
few big companies producing kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity cannabis flower, mids,
you know, I mean, a lot of people will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably diss it as the McDonald's of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like some people will like it and
it'll be affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably eventually most of that,
you know, eventually with federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, the other development that
will happen is interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you will find is that the
most economical place in the world to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce these mid-grade like this
mid-grade pretty decent commodity cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not super craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it will come from California and
it'll all be sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be by far the best,
like the most cost effective way to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce modestly decent weed that's not
absolute like top grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a large consumer, for a large market,
the same way we produce all our other
[SPEAKER_00]: produce in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be very interesting to
see how different the European and the
[SPEAKER_01]: North American markets end up coming over
the next 10 to 20 years, because I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you saw the news of Germany opening up for
the social clubs and a trial period of
[SPEAKER_01]: five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a diluted version of what they
were going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my opinion, it was always basically
what was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharma biotech companies are so strong
and powerful over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see the market as value in terms of
being an ingredient supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're happy to let the
non-for-profit flower activist side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry have at it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they want to protect and ring fence
that big chunk of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be interesting to see how
those two models end up coalescing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when federal legalisation comes,
we all know how capitalism works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the bigger and the stronger eat
the smaller and the little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bigger, the stronger want to
expand outwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be interesting to see
whether that model is available in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: yet for the North American companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that there's been a little
bit of a difference because our banking
[SPEAKER_00]: and business environment has made it
extremely difficult for any established
[SPEAKER_00]: company to dip its toe into this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really prevented a lot of
tobacco companies and pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies from immediately launching a
bunch of cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the market analysis that you
point to in Europe also, it stands to
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, will be replicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers aren't famous for getting rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people growing cannabis,
it's not going to be such a ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: cash crop as some people seem to have
hoped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the predictions come true,
and 10 years from now, a really large
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of the cannabis in America is
consumed in beverages, then it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a chemical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be made like Coca-Cola
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ship bags of concentrate to different
bottling plants in different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they assemble their product in
bottling plants, adding carbonated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a similar process of
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a model that's already been scaled
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will definitely be a big part of
the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, there will be spaces for
craft producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them will be like fine
wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make plenty of money and they'll
be plenty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that'll be a competitive thing to get
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be a different kind of art than
what we see right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, would you believe I'm talking next
to Anna Schwab, who basically we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to break down genetics and a few other
bits and pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very lucky to get to two experts
such as yourselves now back to back and
[SPEAKER_01]: see both sides of this coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I most certainly will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just over our time now, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, we've got to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could talk to you all day about the
chemical processing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we may get to touch base again
towards the end of the year and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: give each other an update on the various
territories and the medical advancements
[SPEAKER_01]: and scientific advancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
Mm hmm.
