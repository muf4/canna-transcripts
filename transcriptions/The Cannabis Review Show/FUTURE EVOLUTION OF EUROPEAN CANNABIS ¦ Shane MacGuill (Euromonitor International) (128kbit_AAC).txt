[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Shane McGill, who's a Senior Industry
[SPEAKER_00]: Manager at EuroMonitor International.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Shane?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how are things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who don't know about EuroMonitor
International, they're one of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: research companies in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview of how you came to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with them and how you dipped your toe into
the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: EuroMonitor is what we call a strategic
research agency, so that means we produce
[SPEAKER_01]: data on an annual basis across a range of
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not like a tactical agency,
so we don't have scanned data like Nielsen
[SPEAKER_01]: would.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing big consumer tracker
panels, etc., but we produce annual data
[SPEAKER_01]: sets on about 30 different industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started working for EuroMonitor about a
decade ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell into it by accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing some legal training by
background and took a break from that and
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up starting to work temporarily,
or what I thought was temporarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I started working within the tobacco
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until about 2016, I was doing that
exclusively looking at the tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, servicing the clients we have on
the tobacco side, which are a mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: industry clients of the big tobacco
companies, but also some of the public
[SPEAKER_01]: health agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In around 2016-17, I started looking at
the cannabis industry initially from the
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective of what impact legalization
that space was going to have on the
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I very quickly realized that the cannabis
industry was something that was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be extremely meaningful across a range of
the industries that we look at within
[SPEAKER_01]: EuroMonitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the structural problems,
if you want to put it that way,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were seeing in industries like
tobacco, but not limited to tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at things like alcoholic
drinks, consumer health, all of those big
[SPEAKER_01]: monolithic legacy industries, consumers
were disillusioned with what those
[SPEAKER_01]: industries were producing, what those
companies were delivering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at, to a certain extent,
tobacco, you can see it very clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the alcoholic drinks industry,
some of those big alcoholic drinks
[SPEAKER_01]: producers are really an exercise in
financial engineering, as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: delivering to what consumers really want
and need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We very quickly came to the conclusion
that the legal cannabis industry that then
[SPEAKER_01]: was had a lot of potential to address a
lot of these issues that consumers had
[SPEAKER_01]: with existing product offerings across a
range of spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of, myself and in particular,
my equivalent on the AD side, Spiros
[SPEAKER_01]: Melondrakis, kind of started developing
the research we were doing on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: space, almost in our spare time,
really, and started to kind of expand and
[SPEAKER_01]: widen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We began to work with clients in that
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a lot of persuading internally in
the company that this was something that
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of serious, that had commercial
potential for us, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've now brought it forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of from that sort of start in about
2016 to here where we now have a kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: fully-fledged cannabis database that sits
alongside all of the other data sets that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have within the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell people, you know,
one of the things that obviously the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry talks about a lot and that we
talk about in the industry is the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: normalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, within your monitor cannabis
is now, I'm quite proud and pleased to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, fully normalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits alongside all of those other
industries that we research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to look at the cannabis space
as an industry in its own right,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also through the lens of those other
industries as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For somebody as big as you guys,
I'm sure like cannabis, after a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of niggling with the bosses, I know you
guys were set up in the 70s, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good while ago, that kind of across
consumer packaged goods, touches across
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, there's a
number of different disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how quickly did you guys get into the
run of things, have been able to create
[SPEAKER_00]: reports was it a year or two of due
diligence or was it information that you
[SPEAKER_00]: already had stacked up in time for the
first report?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was kind of the process of getting
the sector at Euro Monitor off the ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, the first thing for us that
we really wanted to do was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the industry very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as I said, I did a lot of the work
with Spiros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spiros is someone who uses cannabis,
you know, me not so much, but we were
[SPEAKER_01]: coming at it from different angles and we
really wanted to understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry in terms of the regulation
around the space, you know, what companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are currently operating or at that
time were currently operating in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, what, you know, what they're set
up like, what they do, how they produce,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the supply chain is, all of that sort
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent some time due diligence,
but just basically doing our research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're a research agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what, you know, we were,
we started off doing was just making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that we fully understood the industry
space and speaking to people that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we reached out to anyone and
everyone that we could find working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: space who would speak to us to get a sense
of what the industry looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went to some of those early
conferences that were up and around in
[SPEAKER_01]: London and so on to get a handle on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after about six months or a year
or so, we started really writing some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the briefing work that we were doing and
working more closely with clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, as you said,
what sets us apart, I guess, is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have cannabis sitting alongside all of
those other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are a lot of very good
research agencies and data providers,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in North America,
obviously, who are providing very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very granular data in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something we do, but what we
can do is put cannabis in the context of
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the other kind of consumer
verticals that there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, consumers are neither one
thing or another exclusively.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cannabis consumer is not just consuming
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're obviously consuming other areas as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's obviously the potential,
I think, most importantly or most
[SPEAKER_01]: crucially, we feel for cannabinoid
products to compete with products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: existing in other areas and kind of win
over consumers who are already consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: those spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started looking at, you know,
those adjacent industries, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly things like obviously
tobacco, alcohol, consumer health as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, packaged food, those spaces,
the soft drinks industry, and bringing all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that into the equation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been looking at this industry
for a couple of years now and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: started this off as a data gathering
exercise to see who was full of shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: who wasn't, who were the operators,
who wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to me that we're splitting
into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: North America's got their own industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way it looks to me is that Europe
is going to turn into biotech companies
[SPEAKER_00]: and synthetic cannabinoids are going to
dominate cosmetics, food and beverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: vapes, tinctures, a number of other
different projects purely because the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule is safe, it's replicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A million times over, it has to pass the
stringent of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks now even with Germany's
announcement there last week that I always
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that the social club model was
where the rec industry was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were never going to have these
dispensary stores all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it seems to be that the European
industry is now splitting into pharma and
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech dominating the ingredient side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the social clubs giving to the,
let's say, the activists and the consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is that they actually want,
which is right to grow, being able to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: product at a specific price and not be
price scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the industry in Europe has
gone the way I think it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think certainly on the more,
if you want to put a therapeutic side or
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of CBD and medicinal side,
I think that's definitely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of kind of precedent for
regulation at the EU level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at kind of devices regulation
or medicines regulation for the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: might move, certainly the initial kind of
regulation of CBD around novel foods and
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that there's an evidence base
there and that there's licensing and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll see more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, again, Europe is,
to just broaden it out, in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe tends to be more restrictive,
I think, in terms of the way they regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: substance consumption than somewhere like
in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's certainly true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does seem like in the short term in the
rec side that the social club model is the
[SPEAKER_01]: way it's moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, again, there's precedent
for that in terms of what's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are social clubs in some of the
other European markets already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do somewhat wonder ultimately whether
that's going to kind of expand the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry in the way that perhaps the
industry itself would want, perhaps even
[SPEAKER_01]: the way governments would want in terms of
being able to deliver an excise revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: base and all of that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really develop an industry that
employs significant numbers of people and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still slightly hesitant not in
terms of the social club model itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, as you say, that's obviously
something that will deliver to consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want, the flour at the right
price and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strip away a lot of what I guess you
could describe as the nonsense that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think there's a cost of the
social club model in terms of where do you
[SPEAKER_01]: really get that investment that maybe is
needed in the industry to develop things
[SPEAKER_01]: like format, innovation, technology,
to develop kind of brands, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to bring consumers who
aren't already engaged in the legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: industries into the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be, as it looks like is going to
happen in Germany, it may be that the
[SPEAKER_01]: first wave of legalisation, the rec side
in Europe, will be oriented around the
[SPEAKER_01]: social club.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think ultimately it may well go
further than that just because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: shortcoming there in terms of industry
development, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the retail model in Europe
will be dominated by the North American
[SPEAKER_00]: brands like cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already seen some transactions where
people have acquired the rights to cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: stores in Europe already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's going to be the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just with the, they've got a decade of
experience, they'll have the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: know-how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see that there is going to be
capital in the European markets and there
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be brands and let's say retail
stores as big in Europe as they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: North America and we end up exporting over
to North America with some of the brands
[SPEAKER_00]: we create?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do think that there will be
North American brands that have the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to penetrate in Europe,
whether it's going to be cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think obviously there's some kind of
first mover advantage there in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: brand equity and name recognition and all
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, for example, in the
medical cannabis market in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's patients that are looking at
cookies and there's already a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: equity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you look at, again,
for example, an adjacent market like the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol market or tobacco market,
there is a number of local brands within
[SPEAKER_01]: the European space that there has been
over a number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly if you think about that
sort of smaller scale social club model,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that implies really more local,
more indigenous brands, at least initially
[SPEAKER_01]: within the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, again, look at Berlin,
which is likely to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether there's full legalisation in
Germany or whether it goes to some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: regional pilot or a combination of that
and social club.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really imagine the kind of,
I guess, unique culture of Berlin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, developing some strong and
interesting local cannabis brands out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, look at something like Fritz
Cola or whatever, you know, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: only Colas in Europe that has strong
equity, that competes with a big global
[SPEAKER_01]: North American brand coming out of
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there will be those types of
brands in the cannabis space in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it's going to be all
North American brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, if I was someone
who was looking at licensing over a North
[SPEAKER_01]: American brand right now to enter into a
European environment that we don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what that's actually going to look like,
I think I would be probably thinking twice
[SPEAKER_01]: about that, to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of the questions I want to ask
you, you're based in the UK and have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of experience over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I start to see a lot of
is the media entities and let's say some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the companies in the UK, they still
seem to seem that they're part of Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the trading between the UK and
Europe in the cannabis industry is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own another company that trades with the
UK and it's the biggest shit shell I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever dealt with since Brexit came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pack's getting at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the UK cannabis companies being
at a disadvantage to the main European
[SPEAKER_00]: entities in France and Germany and Spain
and countries like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that potentially will become
more of an issue over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, there isn't a huge
industry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there's a certain
infrastructure around the legacy space,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there isn't a huge industry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's not as apparent as it will
become.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's certainly the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, traditionally or over
the last number of years, I think the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has grown up as much around,
you know, while there is sort of strong
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption of CBD and so on in the UK
market, I think the industry there has
[SPEAKER_01]: grown up around the fact that some of the
capital is based in London and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that is happening in that space and
industries have grown up around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they haven't really tested that
trade flow between the UK and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find that over time, you know,
as that infrastructure develops,
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you want to call it isolation will
become kind of more pronounced in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there are strong European
companies increasing in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we know some of the market
companies that are in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the likes of Sanity and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a strong, for example,
again, in Spain, which just came back from
[SPEAKER_01]: ICBC in Spain, as you can see,
like a strong kind of industry beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: to develop in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are seed companies there,
for example, that are amongst the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: employers in the locations in which
they're based and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't think the European
industry is going to be waiting for UK
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to come across and deliver to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there'll be plenty of European
mainland based companies that will be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that for themselves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about
Ireland before we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a cannabis summit in the URDS there
like six weeks ago, sold out, great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pitched as Dublin is going to
be the base for Europe for any North
[SPEAKER_00]: American company that if you're doing
cultivating in Portugal, or extraction in
[SPEAKER_00]: Romania, whatever it may be, that Dublin
should be the main base of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see Ireland being one of the
biggest winners of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: European cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the North American companies are
coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to be geared up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why would they move into a non-English
speaking territory that has a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't they follow the remit that
Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook and the CEO
[SPEAKER_00]: of Pfizer have all done and set up base
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see us being one of the big winners
of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that there's certainly an
argument for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously there's underlying
fundamentals there that you've just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of adverted to in terms of what makes
Ireland attractive for any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time zone language.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the tax as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the levels of education, the sort of
labor force that's there, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think the cannabis industry is
any different to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly when you talk about the
European market likely to be one that is
[SPEAKER_01]: focused around biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that kind of aspect of it,
I think that there's certainly a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: argument for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think obviously the drug policy or the
cannabis policy that's in place there
[SPEAKER_01]: probably feeds into it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested to see now what's going to
happen with the kind of citizens assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there seems to me to be,
again, coming out of a historical
[SPEAKER_01]: background where obviously you wouldn't
have put Ireland as a big candidate for
[SPEAKER_01]: liberalization in terms of cannabis
policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's something interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brewing there, if you look at public
perception around what we should be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the space, I think there could be
movement as well from a policy point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view that actually just enhances that
overall kind of business proposition as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly think that that's an
element here and that Ireland probably
[SPEAKER_01]: could be an oversized player in the
European industry as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it already is to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to look far for an Irish
face in the European cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's plenty of Irish presence as it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of that's going to
reflect or going to come back in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: actual physical presence of companies in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reached over our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could actually talk to you for another
hour on this topic, Shane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get to have a part to you
through this conversation in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the citizens assembly over
here have taken a couple of steps forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can speak after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much, Shane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Shane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
