[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode at Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to join this episode by
Brian Gerber, who's the co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemper and Hara Brands over in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Brian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of how you ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the industry and your
position in the two companies at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the CEO of Hara Brands and Hara
Supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hara Brands is a consumer products
distribution company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We develop our own products in-house and
then we distribute it to smoke shops,
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, sea stores, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Hara Supply is our pre-roll
manufacturing arm where we support a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of the large rolling paper brands,
a lot of the big vanity cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, and we produce about 100
million cones a month and combustibles
[SPEAKER_01]: alike for the cannabis industry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started your company pretty early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give us a little
backstory of how the company was founded,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other co-founders in the company and
your success pretty much from the start at
[SPEAKER_00]: the origins of the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we incorporated in February of 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: We launched May 1st, 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, it was a direct to consumer
subscription box called the Hemper box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that morphed into different
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we did was we leveraged the
subscription box as kind of our Trojan
[SPEAKER_01]: horse marketing outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would develop products, put it in
the subscription box, get feedback from
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of consumers overnight,
take that data, and then go to our
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution and retail partners,
show them the feedback, and then sell them
[SPEAKER_01]: the products to put on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the kind of almost decade
I've been on this journey, that was like
[SPEAKER_01]: the first four years of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then midway through 2017, we got this
interesting opportunity to start producing
[SPEAKER_01]: free rolled cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of fast forward today,
we're now at 14 or 15 manufacturing sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,000 employees in India, and we produce
about 100 million cones a month for the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the two divisions of
Hemper and Hara in its nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an incredible success story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even guys have some well known investors
kind of gave you the first investment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems to be money well spent on their
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the pre roll side of the
product category within cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: was this a segment that you saw the annual
growth rate was going to be significant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice that the technology was
either available in North America or in
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia at a specific price point that made
this market seem like a sensible thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: go out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if we follow tobacco trends,
right, cigarettes are an amazing enormous
[SPEAKER_01]: market, you know, billions and billions
and billions, if not quite trillions a
[SPEAKER_01]: year in sales, in terms of sticks,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with the pre roll segment,
the problem was there was no real
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure set up for anyone to really
scale their pre roll line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as every company in the cannabis
industry is trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_01]: their Coca Cola beverages on the shelf,
right, they needed real infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for, for example, brands like STEEZY,
you know, they go from they launch a
[SPEAKER_01]: product in one market, they want to launch
in three next month, right, there's no one
[SPEAKER_01]: who can really help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we came in and really designed our
business as a solutions partner for the
[SPEAKER_01]: pre roll category.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we identify products and
innovation, and what the brands and MSOs
[SPEAKER_01]: and whoever it is wants to bring to
market, we tell them what's capable and in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of material science, glass,
ceramic, paper, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we guide them in terms of how many of
these can we make, what's the scalability
[SPEAKER_01]: of this skew, before we even go to
producing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that infrastructure was
missing or lacking from the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know, a lot of things in this
market are reused or repurposed or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, there wasn't that
infrastructure set up to scale any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: product line in the pre roll category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've come in within four or five years
of starting over 30% of the market share,
[SPEAKER_01]: just from being a flexible, you know,
under promise over deliver partner for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be the business practices
that you guys have brought to this sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think has seemed to me to be one of the
differential factors that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has such a low barrier to entry
for an entrepreneur to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those with real business acumen who
spot the opportunity are obviously going
[SPEAKER_00]: to excel, excel within their individual
sectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we started this company
when we were 23 years old, and we raised a
[SPEAKER_01]: few million bucks when we were 25 years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're turning 33 in a couple
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a wild journey trying to
navigate this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny, none of the co founders,
RJ, Henry and Ty, we've never worked for
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone else in our lives, straight out of
college, straight into this, never had a
[SPEAKER_01]: boss and just hustled our way through,
you know, that's the way to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: take each project and move on to the next
bigger and better one after each
[SPEAKER_00]: individual has successfully completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think our differentiation of like
our capabilities for the partners,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sometimes, you know,
they always say, I always look at like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of startup culture stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, two is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you get three founders,
it gets a little messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then four, ah, nobody wants a four co
founder team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprisingly in this industry with all the
different nuances, it worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think good corporate structure and
everybody having a specific discipline
[SPEAKER_00]: that they master, I think, is how you
build these proper companies to have
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial growth trajectories and long
term longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the technology side of
your pre-roll manufacturing, do you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire technology and have it in-house or
do you license it out to an outsource
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer who produce based on orders?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those, which of the states in
America do you think is the best for
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll sales?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is Florida, do you think, going to
surpass whoever the best currently is when
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe for our market, California is
the biggest right the second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida is definitely a great market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way they set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will be a big hub there for
major companies and brands to flourish and
[SPEAKER_01]: develop out of there, especially with the
MSOs kind of being headquartered there,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the brands and products,
they're still lacking in terms of what is
[SPEAKER_01]: possible to bring to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're helping guiding everyone
exactly like what's feasible because a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people come to us after multiple
conversations and they go, wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put a logo on the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, we're just printing on
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not science in terms of automation
and technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every cone, most cones, if not 99% of
cones in the market are hand rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a labor arbitrage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've brought in semi-automatic equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've have multiple hedges on automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's really figured it out,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no kill shot at this point or
poison pill, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening is a lot of different
folks out there are developing technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is it takes a lot of money
to develop this because the fragile nature
[SPEAKER_01]: with the paper, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with cigarette paper,
18, 20, 25 GSM, the thickness of the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper, it's much easier to automate that
because of the tensile strengths,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With RYO paper, it's like 12, 13,
14 GSM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you run it through an automated
machine, it can tear, rip very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sensitive and fragile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one's really figured it out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We obviously have been working more at the
forefront of it, but it's still kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: unknown thing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that automation
technology is going to come along within
[SPEAKER_00]: the next couple of years and somebody will
have proprietary technology who will be
[SPEAKER_00]: the large scale manufacturer on a global
scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a strategy to where these
machines are placed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that with lead times and shipping,
I think everyone's moving to vendor
[SPEAKER_01]: managed inventory in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of difficulty forecasting,
figuring out how much product to bring in,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those different metrics that are
typical in normal CPG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't seem to figure it out in this
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everyone's moving to vendor managed
inventory, just in time inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the space to keep pallets
and pallets of cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to keep pallets and
pallets of cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want it to ship to every state
site, whatever it is, whenever they need
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it's not going to just be
one company or one machine that becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: the big, all that 12,000 pound gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a lot of
strategic relationships built along US
[SPEAKER_01]: domestically for North America,
Europe, Asia as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a hub, multiple hubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logistically placed manufacturing hubs
that allow for a quicker delivery as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manufacturing operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the future of the
industry, are you positive on this
[SPEAKER_00]: rescheduling to schedule three?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, do you think it's a positive
thing or a negative thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's positive for my business
because I'm non-plane touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it could potentially be
threatening or alarming or negative
[SPEAKER_01]: towards people who have been in the space
who are in the medical side, who are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the rec side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they like the barriers because
it's harder to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you make it easier to operate,
more people will come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who are these people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they good actors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they bad actors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think for the ancillary people,
it's great news.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the plane touching people,
yes, maybe they get more leniency on
[SPEAKER_01]: banking laws and all those types of
things, and they can do something with
[SPEAKER_01]: their cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of competition coming in,
it's going to open up the floodgates for
[SPEAKER_01]: big tobacco, big pharma, even though
they're already in it, even more so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say the most advantageous
thing of schedule three will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to create air-plowed
pharmaceutical ingredients with these kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of anoids and your own blends and
formulations to target A, B, C and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the capital required to play in that
field is pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you guys have planned
when it comes to Europe for your
[SPEAKER_00]: operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the German market is
going to be a player?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were just that interested back in
Germany a few months ago, back in
[SPEAKER_01]: September.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are coming into Europe with the hard
brand side pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working through a bunch of strategic
relationships right now with distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously very fragmented because
you've got 29 countries, you've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got 29 different languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got 29 different personnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every country is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are coming in very humble,
asking for advice, meeting with certain
[SPEAKER_01]: partners in different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have conversations going on with Spain,
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got France.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Netherlands, which is
obviously massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're really doing is
identifying who are the right partners
[SPEAKER_01]: because in Europe, there's more customer
profiles than we have in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in the States, we have convenience
stores, smoke shops and dispensaries that
[SPEAKER_01]: sell these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, you have souvenir shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got coffee shops, social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got tobacco stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got CBD shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got grow seed stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got actual smoke shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got smart product shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more customer profiles in
Europe than we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each distributor in Europe specializes
in a different channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, it's not just a plug and
play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of understanding the market,
understanding who the right partners are,
[SPEAKER_01]: where are they strong, which customer
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I bet on one, I'm missing the
other six profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I bet on two, I'm missing on four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're navigating it, I think,
a little bit smarter than what normally
[SPEAKER_01]: people would walk into.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd ship a bunch of products to Europe,
get a 3PL, and say, we have products
[SPEAKER_01]: available, buy product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about the euro versus
the dollar, just as we think, we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even think about 10, 20, 30, $40 anymore
here in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't start thinking probably till
about 50, 60, 70, $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, $10, you're thinking the same
level, 10 euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're thinking the same level as me at
100.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me to convince you to buy something
for $10, you're going to go home later and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if you can buy it online for $9.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're coming in trying to be a very
humble approach, understanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, working with the distributors and
the partners, and making sure it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful launch, not just a run and gun
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with Germany, it's massive,
the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're super excited to be at Mary
Jane Berlin in a few months in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be at Spanibus in Barcelona here in
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're just going to do the show
run there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, we will be launching very
heavily in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a very exciting future
outlined in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm no doubt Europe will be smoking
some of your cones over the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're very busy for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who hasn't checked out Harrah
Brands before, the website is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to find it wherever you
watch or listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, Brian, thank you very much
for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
