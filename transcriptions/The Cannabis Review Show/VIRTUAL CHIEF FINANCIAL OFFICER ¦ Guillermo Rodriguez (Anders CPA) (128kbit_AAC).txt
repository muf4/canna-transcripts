[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to join in this episode by
Guillermo Rodriguez, who's a virtual CFO.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Guillermo?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Owen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for taking your time
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting side of the
industry that I'm sure a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: will gain a lot of value out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe start off, though,
by giving everybody a little background
[SPEAKER_01]: overview on how you came to your position
in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a CPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say this, I came to CPA because I
wanted to make money and move out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: parents' house when I was in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I graduated, I went into a very
typical accounting position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accountants do things, do financial
statements, and look into the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for a few years, but the moment
that changed for me was about halfway in
[SPEAKER_00]: through my now 15-year career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working for a large construction
company, and we had to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you hear a lot about now FP&A
departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large companies have financial planning
and analysis professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people that help do
forecasting, raise capital, look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: products are profitable, and just analysis
to make better decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I really moved more into an
FP&A position, a forward-looking position,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had to create a forecast for
this acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed from an accounting career into
more of a corporate finance professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very exciting because I was getting
to do some new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is where the accounting
profession is now moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at accounting firms,
the majority of the revenue now is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies are not just wanting financial
reporting and taxes, but they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for advisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for that financial
relationship to help their companies grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fine doing that in the corporate
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think where everything changed for me,
and I'll get to how I got into cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: was COVID happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around that time, the solution was stand
six feet apart and all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of things, which was good in the
short term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really thinking through this as
like, what's a really long-term solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do this forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really influenced by Ayurvedic
medicine that talks about prevention of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at that moment, I did some
training on that, and it was during the
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's my approach to health is
more about prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't doing that during the pandemic
and my company was having those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: renal regulations that I couldn't agree
with and I couldn't move forward in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left and decided to become an
independent consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was during that year that I found
cannabis, started researching different
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, here's an industry where
people are moving forward with their own
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to health regardless of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was all about empowerment and
people choosing their own path to
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being, and I felt that cannabis was
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on top of that, all the expungement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece of the industry that's
going on is I look at the restorative
[SPEAKER_00]: justice piece where the laws are changing,
the punitive outdated laws around cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal activity are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, these two things I really
want to be a part of, especially because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in a restorative justice ministry at
the time and I felt it was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not knowing how challenging the industry
would be at the time, but at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: over that next year, I joined Anders
Virtual CFO by Anders and became one of
[SPEAKER_00]: their virtual CFOs and now I'm leading up
the cannabis vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like one of the key components
for any good cannabis company is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be hiring a good CFO and a lot of good
CFOs have a very substantial pay packet
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain to everybody what is a
virtual CEO?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the benefits of using a virtual
CEO over a hivern and in-person person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most large companies have an in-house
hired on virtual CFOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, as you mentioned, it's very expensive
and that doesn't even cover the support
[SPEAKER_00]: team around the CFO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a senior accountant, maybe a
controller, all that cost together can be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies of the 2 million to 20 million
range, that's just a really big cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really just can't afford it and it'll
eat into your margins and you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really need a full-on CFO at
that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a virtual CFO is and what we do is we
provide the same level of service,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at a fraction of the cost and at a set
weekly rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a virtual CFO is comes in and it's a
relationship where the clients really know
[SPEAKER_00]: their business, they know what's going on
and hopefully they've thought through
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we come in on the financial
side and we help marry that operational
[SPEAKER_00]: side with the financial side to help move
the business forward and provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: financial support that that business owner
needs, that that client needs to move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really starts with the foundation of
that is what we call dynamic forecasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're in February, so here over
the last couple of months, we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: setting what we call a financial plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people refer to that as a budget
and that's fine, but that's really set in
[SPEAKER_00]: stone at the beginning of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take it a step further and we build a
dynamic forecast that we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: updating every month as we meet with our
clients because things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that way we help our clients look into
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we're trying to do is
help give them a view into the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: their business to make better decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would seem the main objective of all
entrepreneurs and founders is to grow a
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the, let's say, three steps that
you would say are the three must do's for
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs to ensure that to grow a
valuable company is, I mean, 10 million
[SPEAKER_01]: plus type of range, that it's not a small
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all agree that an entrepreneur
can create a small to medium sized
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprise just on pure determination and
drive, but that step up into an eight
[SPEAKER_01]: figure or nine figure style company,
what are the three core components of,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first I would say, especially in
cannabis, you don't want to ruin the value
[SPEAKER_00]: of your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked in M&A and due diligence and
the first thing that anybody does is
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to come over as they're
going to acquire your company or purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: your company is turn over every zone,
every tax return, financial statements,
[SPEAKER_00]: dig through the transactions, especially
on a larger company purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's compliance with your tax return,
with your 401k plan, all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that a buyer would come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure all of that is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another area that we find a lot of issues
in is expenses, especially with small
[SPEAKER_00]: business, you have a lot of commingling of
personal expenses within the business and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's something that has to be
cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to separate that out,
make sure we have a clean set of
[SPEAKER_00]: financials that a buyer can come in and
quickly assess the value of the business
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just like buying a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have it nice and clean and
have good curb appeal, make the
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction easy for somebody coming in,
as well as build a lot of value in the
[SPEAKER_00]: company for a strategic buyer that might
want to come in and fit in your business
[SPEAKER_00]: into theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece is cash flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really tough area in cannabis
because as markets mature, competition
[SPEAKER_00]: gets very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices start to come down, but also in the
US, we have a very punitive tax situation
[SPEAKER_00]: at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effective tax rate for most of these
cannabis companies is well above the
[SPEAKER_00]: average that a typical company would pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say a corporate tax rate of 40% for
a normal company would be somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: around, could be 80 to 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cash after taxes, it's a tough
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that to make the point that the key
area is to know how you're going to scale
[SPEAKER_00]: as you add a second retail location,
as you acquire property.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key around that is the visibility,
is understanding how you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficiency around your costs as you
grow or what cash it was going to take to
[SPEAKER_00]: run the business as you're scaling because
it takes some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you're opening up a third retail
location, there's some upfront cost until
[SPEAKER_00]: you get that retail location running to
full efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kinds of things that
sometimes at a very specific level,
[SPEAKER_00]: we help point out for our clients or on a
larger level through a financial statement
[SPEAKER_00]: forecasting what that might look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's, I want to hire one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does my productivity need to be to
pay for the cost of this person over the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few months?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is it going to take me to get
this payoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: We help look through all those scenarios
and help the clients scale so that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing revenue, but hopefully they can
keep that overhead pretty steady into
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're not growing their costs as
they're growing their revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would seem that the fact that
entrepreneurs are risk takers and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them don't necessarily have financial
acumen when they first set up their
[SPEAKER_01]: company and the bad ones spend money that
they shouldn't have spent too early and
[SPEAKER_01]: the good ones manage to get financial
advice either on the advisory board or the
[SPEAKER_01]: employment because without that financial
guardrails put up, you can end up making a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of missteps that could take years
to recover for your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the metrics that you guys look
for when it comes to measuring companies
[SPEAKER_01]: within the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the key factors that you guys
look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our core consulting approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all businesses, but I'll get more
specific into cannabis, is that for a
[SPEAKER_00]: virtual CFO service, sometimes we're
meeting with our clients up to six times a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: One might be a financial review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another might be we'll look over the
production metrics and then the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics, and then we'll have a series of
cashflow meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a typical month might look
like for a client.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really around the metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're looking at an income
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your sales minus the cost of the
product, say for a cannabis retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call the production or the
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really dig into how those sales are
divided up in terms of different form
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to really take a look at what
the average sale, average value of each
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the US, every state is a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The states that have more competition will
have lower averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newer markets might have higher
transaction sizes, but in any case,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to track where that average
transaction size is week to week and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's changing because that's where we
can really help the retailer in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're talking about retail,
understand, well, how can we increase this
[SPEAKER_00]: number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we need to get it in order to
achieve the level of net income that we
[SPEAKER_00]: set out or to maximize that source,
that location's profitability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the number of transactions,
the number of transactions and the foot
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic coming into the store so we can
track the conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other piece of that is that's
where we can really pull out, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: our transaction size, the number of
transactions coming down, and we'll look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the customer metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big one there is the customer retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, cannabis consumers or
customers have very short lifetime value
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're jumping around looking for
deals, particularly in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll track the average lifetime of a
customer as well as the retention so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see, okay, what do we need to do to go
out and recapture that customer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly is the financial metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at gross margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a retailer, the very highest that
you'll see is somewhere around 50% gross
[SPEAKER_00]: margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the sales minus the cost and
overhead as a percentage of revenue and
[SPEAKER_00]: net income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical retailers, those that are
profitable are somewhere around 15% to
[SPEAKER_00]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at their very bottom line on
their income statement, they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: about 15% of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that to say is that very few are
profitable in this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's very exciting and coming
up, as you well know, is the reschedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would eliminate- You think that
that's going to bring a wave of M&A
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, this rescheduling, because
that's initially I would imagine what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is the people who don't know
how to run a business and read a balance
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet end up getting swarmed by the
heavily vested and highly capitalized
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that can just M&A their way to
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many folks get into this industry not
really wanting to sell before they build a
[SPEAKER_00]: very valuable company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, or for the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for what I call the main street
cannabis, the folks that are maybe first
[SPEAKER_00]: time business owners, the plan wasn't to
sell the business so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much or any institutional
capital in cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a few more couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say you're going to see a lot
more M&A activity this year and next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my hope is that a lot of these
companies can get to profitability with
[SPEAKER_00]: the reschedule and the extra cash flow
that's going to be coming in from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower tax rate to avoid a lot of that
consolidation that's going to happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of it is inevitable just because
of the cash flow issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

Guillermo.
