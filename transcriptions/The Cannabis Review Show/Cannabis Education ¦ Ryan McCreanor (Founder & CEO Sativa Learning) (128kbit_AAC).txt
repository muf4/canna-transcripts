[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little break there, but we're
delighted to be back now and we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: all things cannabis education on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're delighted to be joined by Ryan
McCreener.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the founder and CEO of Sativa
Learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, how are you keeping, mate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, and how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a nice, held summer here over in
Dublin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back into the work now with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to you, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back after holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give everybody a little overview
of how you got to where you are with
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa Learning and your background and
time in Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suppose this is a fairly brief
introduction to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after university, I worked as a
toxicology scientist and the company I
[SPEAKER_01]: worked for created drug testing kits for
drugs of abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the panels I was involved with
and tested for synthetic cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as cannabis, other prescription drugs
and designer drugs or street drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where I got my
introduction to the world of toxicology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that for a few years and then later
went off traveling and ended up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was in Vancouver, I worked for
the government when just shortly after
[SPEAKER_01]: they legalized adult use or recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, so I was on the phones,
taking calls from the public on everything
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with cannabis and educating around
cannabis and eventually moved into a
[SPEAKER_01]: training role where I would travel to
retail stores across British Columbia and
[SPEAKER_01]: educate the cannabis consultants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and moved home back to back to
Belfast, not too far away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was end of 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I decided to set up Sativa
Learning as an education platform for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a fair deal of experience
already before you set up Sativa Learning
[SPEAKER_00]: and know exactly what to teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk about the cannabis education
worldwide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've got Amsterdam over the US,
Leafley have their own one on one version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody seems to have that that little
introductory module for everybody to get
[SPEAKER_00]: their grips around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you see as having the best cannabis
education at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Europe or is it North America?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say definitely North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you say, Oakster Dam are probably one
of the biggest leaders in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Flower Academy are also doing very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's Cannabis Training
University, Trichome Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a lot of these platforms
which are very successful in North
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that a leader has
emerged yet here in the UK, even Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think even Australia,
New Zealand could do with a leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there is one that started in South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name escapes me at the minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, we're seeing a lot of cannabis
education platforms pop up at the minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you look at what's
happening in North America, colleges and
[SPEAKER_01]: universities are now starting to offer
cannabis education programs and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them in conjunction with cannabis
education platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at what the future of the
cannabis industry is going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's my belief that it's going to be like
any other industry where you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need some form of formalized, credible
training and education to secure a
[SPEAKER_01]: position within the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you're unfamiliar with the
cannabis industry, you might be too sure
[SPEAKER_01]: as to why that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the industry as a
whole, from seed to seed banks,
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, cultivation, extraction,
purification, product formulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the retail side of things, operating a
cannabis business, cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many avenues and aspects to the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it's wellness, medical,
recreational, or even if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the industrial hemp side, which is a whole
other category as well, there is a need
[SPEAKER_01]: for credible, formalized training in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're trying to do with
Sativa Learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason it's been set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I returned home from Canada,
I noticed there was a big gap in
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, especially in the CBD industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we released a course on the
CBD industry to provide a comprehensive
[SPEAKER_01]: overview for people trying to get a better
understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're going to do is just
continue to add different courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now working on a medical cannabis
course with the Medical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Clinicians Society in the hopes that we
can start educating more clinicians on
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribing cannabis based medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, actually we're coming to move
into the next topic now seems that you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was educating medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems to be the hardest hurdle that a
lot of people are having to overcome is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is no doctors who know what
they're talking about generally and none
[SPEAKER_00]: of them want to prescribe a medicine that
they don't know what they're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to be the magic arrow that
gets through to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be targeting a specific
association of doctors and get them all on
[SPEAKER_00]: board in one fell swoop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there going to be some super celebrity
doctor that gets on board and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them start to follow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see happening over the next
six to 12 months that will help get the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients to access to the products that
they need?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hard one to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many factors involved in why
medical professionals are not educated on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis based medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tricky to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the main reason, as you touched
on, is there's just a lack of education
[SPEAKER_01]: for them at the minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anybody that's familiar with
cannabis will know a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for anybody that doesn't know,
it was only discovered in the 1990s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has yet to make its way into
standard medical teaching, whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: your continuing teaching as a medical
professional or when you're a student in
[SPEAKER_01]: university.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it's a neurotransmitter system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors will be familiar with the likes of
the serotonin system, the dopamine system,
[SPEAKER_01]: the noradrenaline system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vast majority of medical
professionals will have no understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's vital to our function.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've heard of Dr. Ethan
Rousseau.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a world renowned cannabis researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he uses the prime example that there
are more cannabinoid receptors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain than there are for all other
neurotransmitters put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has an overall role in memory,
pain control, sleep, appetite,
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature control, immune response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reason why cannabis
medicines can benefit such a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be similar to a mechanic knowing
nothing about the engine of a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how important the endocannabinoid
system is to our health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have endocannabinoids in the body
that regulate that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when that system is not functioning
optimally, we can introduce cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: from cannabis to supplement that and help
bring about homeostasis in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the, I suppose the main
one is the lack of education on the ECS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's the issue of plant medicine
versus single compound pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_01]: or more broadly, I suppose people will
look at it as Eastern medicine versus
[SPEAKER_01]: Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Western doctors have been conditioned
to think about medicine in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually that's a single compound drugs
to combat a certain condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis doesn't really fall into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there needs to be a paradigm shift
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis contains hundreds of active
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a polypharmacy in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are over 140 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are over 100 terpenes and 20 or more
flavonoids that all interact.
[SPEAKER_01]: When ingested, they interact with each
other synergistically to create an overall
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, which is known as the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doctors are just not comfortable with
that at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no training on botanical
medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that as well will be fear of
the unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: For them, a doctor that's used to
prescribing pills to a patient will be
[SPEAKER_01]: very uncomfortable with a patient
vaporizing dried flour to get relief for
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain or whatever it happens to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are a couple of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes to the,
I suppose, the research side of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a lack of randomized controlled
trials, which would be considered kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the gold standard for single
pharmaceutical compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some for cannabis and
products like Epidiolex have made it to
[SPEAKER_01]: market through clinical trials and RCTs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis does not lend itself very
well to randomized controlled trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, because there are hundreds of
active compounds which work together to
[SPEAKER_01]: give an overall effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And due to that lack of RCTs, then there
are very restrictive guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll use the example in the UK
because I know a bit more about the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines than the Ireland ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But NICE, they're the National Institute
of Healthcare and Excellence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they provide guidelines to the NHS for
prescribing medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their guidelines for cannabis are very
restrictive because they have not looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at cannabis medicine as whole plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, they've pushed it down the single
compound route and only looked at RCTs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which there are not many of.
[SPEAKER_01]: When really they should be looking at
real-world evidence and case studies and
[SPEAKER_01]: observational data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because the guidelines are so
restrictive, even if a doctor was educated
[SPEAKER_01]: and willing to prescribe, it's not that
it's frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the guidelines are very
restrictive for them to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another issue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might know, actually, there was a
couple of private clinics opened up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Manchester and London that were
prescribing cannabis to its patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: How have they fared?
[SPEAKER_00]: And has that been a case of they've
literally just gone and found a doctor and
[SPEAKER_00]: a nurse, trained them up on cannabis,
and then they can open up their own
[SPEAKER_00]: practice to prescribe cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it as simple as that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about how.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't know the ins and outs of
actually setting up a clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do know is that you have to be on
the GMC specialist register to prescribe
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the UK system is actually quite liberal
in that you can prescribe for any
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not within the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not recommended in the guidelines,
but they don't recommend against cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the minute, they have Epidiolex,
Nabalone, and Sativex would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: approved prescription cannabis-based
medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to prescribe an unlicensed
cannabis medication like dried flour or a
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum oil, doctors will be
hesitant to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the minute, the latest... Sorry to
interrupt you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a doctor did prescribe and say,
look, I recommend dried flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that product available to a consumer in
the UK at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, at the moment it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just considered an unlicensed
medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you have to be on the GMC
specialist register to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are patients currently receiving
cannabis flour or cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they are unlicensed medications,
but there are around 6,000 private
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem is private prescriptions,
of course, are very expensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: unaffordable for most patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the minute, those clinics have... I
believe there's, last time I talked to
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Barnes, around 60 to 70 medical
cannabis clinicians currently prescribing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have prescribed around 6,000
unlicensed cannabis medications,
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are only three NHS prescriptions
in the UK, which is just shameful,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a bit of a drastic ratio
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to get the feedback in what
negative connotations have happened to any
[SPEAKER_00]: of the patients of those 6,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be willing to bet a large sum of money
that it's pretty much zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good thing is there's the likes of
Project 2021, I don't know if you've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of that before, through drug science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're aiming to enroll 20,000
cannabis patients and create one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest bodies of evidence for medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be real world evidence that
they're providing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are starting to release some of
their findings from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to keep an eye on that as
well to see how cannabis patients are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've had some very positive results
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing, so great, very positive to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, we hit our time here for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd definitely love to have you back on
and we can get into more detail and start
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about some CBD receptors and some
other finer details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you saw Peter Greenspoon's
paper there in the Harvard Medical there
[SPEAKER_00]: the other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very informative and there's lots
to discuss there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you a million for coming on the
show, Ryan, it's much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you, Owen, and thanks for
doing your bit to spread the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've had some fantastic guests on,
so I appreciate the work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Fred, it's very much
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll chat to everybody in the next
episode and everybody have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
