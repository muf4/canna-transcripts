[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Alex Popoff, who's a Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Intelligence Development Officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Alex?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody an
overview of quick 30 seconds of where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are in your business world?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you cover a couple of different
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Alex Popoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a US Air Force veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally got into cannabis when I
found actually just using cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: socially with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't needing pain medication as much
for my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had several back surgeries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, in early 2018,
I come to learn about all of the research
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of the amazing benefits of
cannabis and how we had been lied to for
[SPEAKER_01]: so long about the benefits worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got involved with advocacy work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a bit of digital marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bachelor's degree in digital
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of learned that marketing is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an essential component.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't come naturally to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a passion for it,
even with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the moment that I began my business
intelligence master's degree this January,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started connecting the dots with
cannabis and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started talking to some of the leading
cannabis data companies because their
[SPEAKER_01]: employees were kind enough to reach out to
me and say, hey, here's what we do when
[SPEAKER_01]: you graduate if you're interested in this
type of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of got a little peek inside of
what's going on at some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to some of the license holders
that are going through an upgrade process
[SPEAKER_01]: with their data system and seen under the
hood a bit, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I just really love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a veteran that's found cannabis has
helped me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten involved in advocacy and now
I'm pivoting from marketing into the data
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics and business intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, incredible, Stufi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sector you're in now is going
to be a cornerstone of this industry over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next decade or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like yourselves are going to be
the next big names to start here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me an overview?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any big business that's using
data analytics properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you're using it, whether it's
for marketing, improving that,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's in product improvement and
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the big companies, like is there
Cureleaf, Green Tum, any of the guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that have actual data departments
in their companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know as much about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So surprisingly, but I will say I will
speculate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people where it says like data
analysts and it's at one of the big MSOs
[SPEAKER_01]: like you described.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what gets me more excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it at like the mid-tier level as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say mid-tier like, you know,
maybe they're in two states, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not a Cureleaf and they're in like more
than 10 or whatever they've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and these folks, they'll still have a
full data section.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not use like the big data tools
and all of the stuff that you hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: in academia and with analysts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enterprise level like Fortune 500s or the
big MSOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll go beyond using an Excel
spreadsheet by all means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked to some of these folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible the analysis they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's everything from what's our best
selling product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your point of sale systems,
most of them that I know of will give you
[SPEAKER_01]: basic business intelligence dashboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say, you know, here's your busiest
time of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your best selling product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the SKUs that are up and coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have all kinds of features.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best data is your own data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't really know where they're
deriving this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not granular enough because you
can't manipulate it your own way most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am seeing some of these smaller
operators actually using tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just relying on, you know,
what their POS has out of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a specific model of gathering
the data that they're using themselves or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it basically firsthand knowledge or
social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you think is the most
advantageous route to gather data if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're an entrepreneur watching this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say a combination, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always want to have this what we
refer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know from academics they'll teach us
is a single source of the truth because
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want you don't want three
different top selling products unless it's
[SPEAKER_01]: different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want you want one source of the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what I would say is you'll see
everything from scraping like websites and
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting the price points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a local dispensary retailer might say,
OK, the average price per gram for this
[SPEAKER_01]: strain even is four dollars or fifteen
dollars or something in that range,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can vary widely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why they would want to know
exactly what that price point is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also be something where they need
to use like the AI and language learning
[SPEAKER_01]: models we talked about before we started,
where they're going to do sentiment
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluations, where they'll scrape social
media sites and then they'll analyze
[SPEAKER_01]: everything to emoji to text to determine
what sentiment the community has on their
[SPEAKER_01]: brand and on their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be surprised if, like you
said, Curaleaf and these other companies
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't doing that or not doing that 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in this modern day and age now you
didn't you don't really need to spend half
[SPEAKER_00]: a million on wages for data scientists to
come in and basically analyze data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can have a number of
proficient people on these new AI programs
[SPEAKER_00]: and plugins to be able to at least get
your start in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But data, I'm sure, is going to influence
when federal legalization comes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: states, like with every other industries,
there's a handful of dominant brands and
[SPEAKER_00]: they target their products and their
nuanced advertising, various sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building that data from the ground up
is probably a pyramid now to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, like there's the co-founder of
pardon me, I misspoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd missed out my companies there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I meant to say is that there are
companies out there where they're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback on certain products and certain
strains and using AI and using data
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics and big data tools to determine
how is this product affecting people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there certain terpenes giving certain
effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and there is just dozens and
dozens, if not hundreds of different apps
[SPEAKER_01]: and companies approaching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an expert on any of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about data is when we say data,
we can talk about cannabis research data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, the big business side
of things, it just hits every facet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I love is you're never going
to get bored or tired of it because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can go in so many directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things about the data side of
things, we kind of see it over in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: here that people cherry pick and specific
data to kind of suit their own and
[SPEAKER_00]: valuation or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of this country is going to be
worth this amount of money by this year
[SPEAKER_00]: claims that I've seen over the last number
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that as much in America as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find the words here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it is in Europe,
so I can't make a comparison, but I would
[SPEAKER_01]: say it's probably worth it even without
knowing what's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a data driven decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my own bias from being an
American in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're terrible at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that I can say this rather than
compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it with these large companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was apprehensive to be like,
oh yeah, they're doing great work in data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they're kicking butt in data,
but I want to see the smaller operators
[SPEAKER_01]: and everyone have a chance to,
because like you said, they can cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: pick data and say, look, we're the safest,
cleanest product with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of that just comes from being the
biggest voice and having the most money in
[SPEAKER_01]: the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you can pick the data,
do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone can, but especially when you have
the money to kind of shape perception
[SPEAKER_01]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only way that you can actually
really trust that is if it's been gathered
[SPEAKER_00]: at the source itself and you can
amalgamate data then to make larger
[SPEAKER_00]: reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think looking from afar and taking a
couple of different papers and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different numbers and translating them
into your, let's say, document that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give data to somebody else seems
to be the model that's been used so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a value and is there a company
in the US that has gone state by state and
[SPEAKER_00]: has gathered data, whether it's via medium
of music events or consumption parties or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it may be?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that seems like the smartest route
for a company to do and then translate
[SPEAKER_00]: that data back into a software platform
like a tableau that somebody can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'd be shocked if they're not doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned about this in marketing where
you're doing your focus groups and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback from your target audience and
saying, hey, sometimes with innovation in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, you don't really know what the
consumer wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always competing views like
the view of, oh, you need to show the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that works in some tech
applications, but with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: people know they like cannabis,
but it is complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it comes down to looking at
things like why are we collecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Define the problem and then go out and
don't just generate groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, put it in a tableau,
put it in a Power BI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Power BI is the one that I'm familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's Looker and there's tons of
visualization tools that people can use
[SPEAKER_01]: because data doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said this to my girlfriend before
the call is like, you know, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to touch on the fact that people think
data is all numbers and it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: But data can be qualitative when you take
it, when you can transform it and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a format that the computer programs
can analyze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you drive the most value.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk to people and say,
how is this working for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just mass surveys, the spray
and pray approach is not my approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I'd sooner talk to 100 people in
10 different cities and get their opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: than send out 10,000 surveys that get
filled out by a much smaller group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data that's recovered on the ground,
I think, is where there's huge value in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry over the next
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep looking to my left over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my other screen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send you this after our call
so you can maybe screenshot or just for
[SPEAKER_01]: your own viewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an analytics dashboard, actually,
that the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Use
[SPEAKER_01]: Agency has commissioned a contractor to
put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just beautiful because it shows
you the density of licenses per county.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows you the total commercial license
trend over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows you things like total licenses by
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: From cultivation to retail, process,
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly the type of stuff that
I'm learning to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's so helpful because from
an investment point of view, you can look
[SPEAKER_01]: at this and see, is more cannabis being
harvested month over month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there more harvest total?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get very granular and look at the
specifics and get a better idea of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like we talked about,
then you combine that by talking to people
[SPEAKER_01]: in different counties and different
cultivators, different license holders and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, how do you think the market's going?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's business intelligence and data
analytics working together and still being
[SPEAKER_01]: a human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a quick overview of what's
happening in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: How restrictive is the sector there and
how well is it working or not working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's chaotic in many ways, as you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: People call it the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at the data, you can see
it's not all cartels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an organized crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those elements will exist most likely
everywhere in the world at all times to
[SPEAKER_01]: some degree, hopefully to a lesser degree
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a new market, people are
going to try to take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's happened here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happens everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since this is the most conservative
red Republican state, it's ironic that it
[SPEAKER_01]: has the most progressive and liberal
program for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see is you see the state
regulators, there's a disconnect between
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry and the regulators,
like in most places as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that the state wants there
to be less licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, I'm looking at the
dashboard and there's something like
[SPEAKER_01]: 11,000 or 13,000 licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 8,000 cultivators alone and
there's no plant limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all 8,000 growers grow as many plants
as they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our population is somewhere like 3.4
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the price over there at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the price per gram or price
per ounce at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So price per pound per outdoor,
people are saying anything from 250 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 400, which is extremely low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you see 1,000,
3,000, 4,000 even in other states,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's again, when we look at the data,
there's going to be outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still people that can get more,
much, much more for their quality outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: and for quality indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's probably people selling for 50
bucks a pound too if it's very low quality
[SPEAKER_01]: going right to extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a major glut of biomass,
of cannabis biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I, again, I look at the data
here, there's less and less harvest month
[SPEAKER_01]: over month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there needs to be some, there needs to
be a balance and the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a free market because you have
Kansas and Texas, Louisiana, all our
[SPEAKER_01]: bordering states that, and Arkansas even
that have more restrictive or no cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: legal at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so people will produce product where
it's affordable and sell it where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of sums up the market,
but it's good for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prices are low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So price per pound, like I said,
is that so as a patient, I can get an
[SPEAKER_01]: eighth from somewhere from $5 to $50.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the quality level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can pay 170 an ounce and get very good
quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's good for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I rant a lot, but I want to give
you the complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just coming up on the 15 minutes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get to do a part two of this
conversation after you've finished all the
[SPEAKER_00]: exams and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can deep dive into this industry,
because as I said, I think this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a cornerstone of the cannabis
industry and anybody who doesn't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to mix business intelligence with data
gathering on their source will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: losers in this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you very much, Alex,
for now, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You summed it up well, very Morris.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sink than I could, but thank you for
having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'd love to come back when I'm
either employed or graduated or both,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a plan, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great week and I will chat to
you soon until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
