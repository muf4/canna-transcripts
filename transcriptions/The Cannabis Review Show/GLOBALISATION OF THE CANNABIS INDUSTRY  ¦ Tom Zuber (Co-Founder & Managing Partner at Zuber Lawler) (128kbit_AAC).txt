[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by this episode
by Tom Zuber who's a founder and managing
[SPEAKER_00]: partner at Zuber Lawler.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Tommy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very good Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a renowned attorney in a number of
different spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm delighted to get to talk to you and
hopefully get some solid information out
[SPEAKER_00]: of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody just a quick
overview of how Zuber Lawler and yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up in the cannabis industry and the
timeline in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks to God we were in the right
place at the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm based in Los Angeles, California,
and Zuber Lawler has offices across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis in one sense was born in
America, legalized cannabis here in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first state to legalize the
medicinal level back in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got into cannabis, this is ancient
history now, way back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was to our knowledge before any
corporate law firms per se had really
[SPEAKER_01]: entered the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were defense attorneys that
started doing contracts and licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we started getting asked to do things
like the first real external raise,
[SPEAKER_01]: the partnership dispute, IP issues,
the heavier regulatory issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, well, we'd like a corporate law
firm to do this and would you guys help?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a buddy, my first client was
actually, it was a buddy who I had known
[SPEAKER_01]: just about here in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started a company, I'll give him a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Kenny Morrison with the Venice
Cooking Company, still a dear friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine and still a client.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, hey, Tom, can you guys help
out here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to do this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: We quickly became very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within five, six, seven years,
thanks to God we had a long list of
[SPEAKER_01]: clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to be the or one of the longest
lists of cannabis clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the country at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hadn't gone after a single client.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's literally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just getting phone calls and
emails as a function of being,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could say the corporate law
firm that was embracing the subject matter
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We realized that cannabis was going to be
as big as pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do work in the pharma industry and
in other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, we're all in.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point we do as much cannabis work
as any law firm in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we have, Owen, as you've
noted, we've really gotten around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We represent many of the bigger players in
the industry in respect of their high
[SPEAKER_01]: stakes acquisitions and finance and IP and
regulatory and litigation matters,
[SPEAKER_01]: the international work, which is
increasingly coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that conversation is something we'll
have on this Zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we've gotten involved,
I guess you could say in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We founded Global Go, which became a
premier cannabis consultancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really see something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided we needed a friend like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got involved in starting one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've now achieved, that team has
achieved over 250 cannabis licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with an incredible success rate,
we are involved in the launching of Global
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Times, which is now a successful
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just released their fourth issue and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess you could say in addition to
serving the legal industry as lawyers,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're also fans of the subject matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really believe in its potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: As human beings, we believe in its
potential to uplift the human condition
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all in both in terms of heart and
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be probably the perfect
person who's seen there and been there and
[SPEAKER_00]: done that and seen all the different
facets of the industry to be able to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about a couple of topics I want to bring
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is globalization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to ask the question is,
is Europe actually going to end up being
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect destination via the capital
that's already going to be readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available in North America?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will want new markets to expand to
and investors in capital that are already
[SPEAKER_00]: based in Europe who will see this new
emerging market as something intriguing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the with good returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Europe going to be maybe the center of
the cannabis industry in 10 years time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that fanciful thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think it's fanciful
thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I think about it in terms
of central.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be that things are
going to be disproportionately weighted in
[SPEAKER_01]: the direction of Europe and that that
notion of things is going to increase as
[SPEAKER_01]: time goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got an awful lot of people there on
the European content with a with a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: standard of living.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's just just that statement
alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got you've got nearly twice as many
people as we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the same standard of living over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I think there are some things
going for Europe that we didn't have going
[SPEAKER_01]: for us here in the United States and
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those things, for example,
is the example of the United States and
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get to learn from all our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I think that there's an
assuredness that this is going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: right here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was sort of disbelief in up until 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this really happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Europe has seen, OK, this really
is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to look at the United States
to see that that that that's probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, I think that Europe is going
to have an easier time of collaborating
[SPEAKER_01]: between jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here in the U.S., you can't put THC
in the trunk of your car and drive it
[SPEAKER_01]: across the state line from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get arrested by federal agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Europe, you do have the potential
to move cannabis THC across state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think that that increasingly
the weight of the conversation is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: move to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a function of the sheer size
coupled with the purchasing power per per
[SPEAKER_01]: resident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I think an ability to move
things across borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, the fact that you've got
the lesson of the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mistakes we made and some of the
things that we did well, the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada, you get to leverage that,
I think, to move quicker than we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think things are going to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can also tell you, just as far as
anecdotally, we are talking about Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: over here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exceedingly great place,
exciting place to focus on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is in terms of investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in terms of how do we get product
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very exciting conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Europe's got that beautiful
relationship that whether you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the consumer focus side of things,
there's a heavy consumer base already
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you decide to go down the
biosynthesis route and create your own
[SPEAKER_00]: blends and formulations and APIs,
Europe already has the infrastructure and
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry know how here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the two pronged attack
will end up coming from Europe from the
[SPEAKER_00]: get go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of, I think, going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here from our remote perspective
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at Europe, we're trying to
say, OK, how is this going to play out?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is this going to work out?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the cannabis industry going to look
like that the international cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry exists on the European continent?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that going to look like in three
years and in five years and in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a fun thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges here, for instance,
in Germany is that it's accepted pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: broadly that Germany is not going to be
able to produce enough to meet its demand
[SPEAKER_01]: there in Germany.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so immediately from the get go,
you've got an interesting situation there
[SPEAKER_01]: that really you don't have here in the
United States where you say, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: California doesn't have enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, we've got plenty of product now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But two, even if we didn't, there's no
option to drive in that THC from
[SPEAKER_01]: neighboring states.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Europe, that is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just goes to show that while there
are going to be a lot of parallels between
[SPEAKER_01]: how things developed over here on our side
of the neighborhood and how they develop
[SPEAKER_01]: over there and on your side of the
neighborhood, I think that there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of exciting differences, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those differences is that
Germany can now plug its capacity needs by
[SPEAKER_01]: importing THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really is, I think, a phenomenal
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's those sorts of things,
I think, that we're so excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the United States, when we look at
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with the moving and happenings
happening in the Czech Republic at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment, I think you'll have these
connected countries that end up
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitating commerce between each other
and allows for Europe to grow in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: smoother and quicker way than,
let's say, North America, because you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of broke the barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to learn from all of the
examples that have been set before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really is the trick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to learn from your own
mistakes, but you'd rather learn from the
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's even better, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free, I guess, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to do that by looking at some of
the things that we've done wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will, just as long as I'm here,
because we do care about our friends over
[SPEAKER_01]: there in Europe, I would take a good hard
look at some of the troubles we're having
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resist the temptation just to tax
everything as much as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is self-destructive,
even from the tax authority standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're going to kill the body that
lifts the hand that feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make any sense here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to allow the industry to grow,
and people are getting crushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if this is a well-known
fact in Europe, but here in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: over $250 million, and this is tragic,
over $250 million of taxes are owed by
[SPEAKER_01]: California cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say that again, over $250 million of
taxes are owed by cannabis companies here
[SPEAKER_01]: in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that is really, that's a depressing
statistic, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that means that the burning here
that has been placed on California
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis companies is really quite
extreme, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those pressures come from a number of
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taxation, I think, is really,
it really is counterproductive in many
[SPEAKER_01]: regards, in terms of the size of it,
in terms of the flippancy of the taxation
[SPEAKER_01]: scheme, but also the illicit markets here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it very tough to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: The illicit markets don't have to pay
their taxes, and they don't have to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for compliance in the same way that
licensed companies do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do you compete on price with an
illicit shop that's down the street?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lack of enforcement against those
illicit products, that's something else
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would look for there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want to enable your legalized
industry to thrive more than it can if the
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit industry is thriving at lower
price points, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is another important thing that I
would take away from the conversation here
[SPEAKER_01]: in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anybody in Europe, if you're not
studying the taxation models of the
[SPEAKER_00]: various states and understanding where the
economic went right and went wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing yourself a disservice to the
country you're working in because we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be accumulating as much knowledge
and data as we can to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitate creating the best industries
within each individual territory that's
[SPEAKER_00]: over here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to move on to the final topic
before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man, and it's
facilitating commerce between territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell, is Safe Banking Act going
to basically be the cure to all ailments,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it going to be more complicated than
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's... Now you're... We've had
that dangled in front of us for so long
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the thing that's coming and
never arrives, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So prohibition itself behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a feeling, and this makes me
naive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a notion that we'll see safe
banking sometime within the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, and I think it may happen sooner
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think we'll see prohibition
end anytime soon, but I do think we'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: safe banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I think that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is, as much as it's seen as a
partisan issue here, and I think in some
[SPEAKER_01]: respects, you'll find evidence for that to
a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll also find evidence that in many
ways it's bipartisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are folks on both sides of the aisle
here that really think that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nonsensical that we have all this commerce
happening and you can't get a bank
[SPEAKER_01]: account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does in terms of the
government's perspective and how that
[SPEAKER_01]: really is not in the government's interest
to have all this money floating around out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, that's not in the banking system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think we'll see something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's enough folks on both sides
of the aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that does make me naive because that's
been out there for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm happy to be in that naive camp on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll join you on that naive camp as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that hopefully in
the next 12 to 18 months that we see end
[SPEAKER_00]: of coming to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we shall cross our fingers until then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom, I know you're a very busy man,
so I'm not going to keep you any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we get to touch base over
the next 12 months if there's any movement
[SPEAKER_00]: on safe banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it's an absolute pleasure to see
you again always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great to have friends over there
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
Oh.
