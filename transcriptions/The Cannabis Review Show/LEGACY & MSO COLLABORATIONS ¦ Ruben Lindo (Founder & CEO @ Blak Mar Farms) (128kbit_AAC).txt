[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Ruben Lindo, who's the founder and CEO
[SPEAKER_00]: of a number of operations in the cannabis
industry in America and has been around
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry for the past 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruben, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on, Ruben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you maybe give everybody a quick
little overview and under a minute of the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that you're currently a part of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you found yourself in the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the founder, as you said,
and CEO of Black Mar Farms, which is our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation and cannabis
cultivation management facility management
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also the CEO and founder of Phoenix
Nutraceutical, which is our CBD company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our first baby and our first
foray into the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Black Mar Farms has a subsidiary or
sister company called Urban Couture,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a lifestyle branding,
product branding and event hosting
[SPEAKER_01]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was doing my research and you seemed
to come across as a man who's got a wealth
[SPEAKER_00]: of experience and knowledge to do with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump straight into the
first topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something that it seems
pretty obvious from the outside looking
[SPEAKER_00]: in, but doesn't seem to be something
that's been enacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's collaboration and not
competition between the MSOs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you agree with the statement that the
MSOs and the legacy market should be
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating because it seems to be a
perfect marriage or is all the competition
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happening at the moment what should
be happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that to take it a step further,
I think that the the onus is on the MSOs
[SPEAKER_01]: to collaborate not only with the legacy
market, but also the small business and
[SPEAKER_01]: the smaller operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I think if you really
think about this from a collaborative
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, you know, eight years ago,
none of us would be collaborating or even
[SPEAKER_01]: competing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would be co-conspirators, right,
because it's still federally illegal and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's illegal, you know, would have been
illegal in most of the states in which we
[SPEAKER_01]: operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in the spirit of of
collaboration, there's some innovation
[SPEAKER_01]: there and there's some ability for these
larger companies who are very well
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalized to work with smaller companies
like myself or or even folks coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the legacy market who have established
brands because there are things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do that that the big MSOs just can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow craft cannabis to our scale
financially where they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they have these huge facilities,
it's hard to grow the type of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be considered craft cannabis,
not saying that they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't fit their business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is the wealth of
products that are currently in the legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: market or in the craft small to medium
size market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to put products out at a at a
rate that is much faster than some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these larger companies, because again,
they have to check a lot of the boxes and
[SPEAKER_01]: their bottom line drives them just like
our bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your bottom line is significantly
smaller or shorter to the target,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's easier for us to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, I think that speed to
commerce through collaboration is is
[SPEAKER_01]: really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree with you totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's going to be a case now where the
MSOs are the ones that have to come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and it baffles me that some of
these MSOs haven't haven't created funds
[SPEAKER_00]: and gone out and done mergers and
acquisitions with the top tier talent that
[SPEAKER_00]: may not have, let's say, the business
acumen to bring their business to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale national company, but have all
the industry know how and expertise to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to work to budgets and ensure that
everybody's working as a cohesive unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mentioned that last week at M
.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: BizCon on stage with with, you know,
Acre Holdings and Wana Brands and the
[SPEAKER_01]: parent company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said to them, there are definite
advantages in collaborating and bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: top talent in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of the issue, though,
is there's there's a trust factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there still remains a huge divide
between the large companies, the big MSOs
[SPEAKER_01]: and companies like myself or the operators
coming out of the legacy space where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still just not sure where they can
trust, who they can trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that in the next couple of
years, we're going to see that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration in the spirit of of less of
competition, because really, if you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, if we're all operating on the
adult use legal side here in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and in most countries, in most
states, we're competing for 17 to 20
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of the market.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really we have to figure out how to
dominate that segment so that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: strengthen this and make it more
attractive for legacy operators to come
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a legacy operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I transitioned over into the adult use
legal side of this business at the
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate level because two things that
made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw the bigger play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to even speak to you in
Ireland and folks in the UK and all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, my vision for cannabis has
always been global from day one when I
[SPEAKER_01]: came into this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that as we start seeing the
global reach of cannabis, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the need for more collaboration and
less collapsing of the industry with
[SPEAKER_01]: acquisitions and mergers and more keeping
independently subsidiaries or wholly owned
[SPEAKER_01]: subsidiaries working in conjunction with
the big capitalized companies to put out
[SPEAKER_01]: some great, tremendous products and reach
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
it's about getting the plant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient's hands and folks hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how we look at this,
this is still plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump on to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I've been getting
lots of mixed information about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the New York autumn crop of cannabis
that was grown and apparently is sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around with a very high valuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me exactly what happened with the New
York autumn crop this year and if one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the news we're hearing is true or false.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know exactly what you're
hearing, but I can only speculate to what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that there's a mix of truth
to what we've all heard, that there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amount of cannabis harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something north of 700,000 pounds
of cannabis harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that probably about 20 to 25% of
that may be viable to go into a smokable
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of it is biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't personally tested, but I've
spoken to some of the farms and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them have turned out pretty decent
product, but you know, there's an alarming
[SPEAKER_01]: issue when the regulators drop the testing
parameters in the first harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: always you'll see them play with the
numbers, but when they dropped it
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly so that the mold count could
pass into the market, I think that that
[SPEAKER_01]: was really a telling sign that it's going
to be a lot more difficult than people
[SPEAKER_01]: think it is to grow outdoor cannabis in
New York, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had probably the wettest August,
September, probably in the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had very high humidity,
exorbitantly high humidity and hot
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures all the way until November,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't make for a very good
environment to grow outdoor cannabis as
[SPEAKER_01]: your primary cash crop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we saw, and I believe
this, what we're going to see is a shift
[SPEAKER_01]: to more indoor and greenhouse cannabis
with one or two, one real harvest of
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that product may go to
biomass and go into your oils and your
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles, which is great, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still Sunkissed Cannabis is Sunkissed
Cannabis, but I don't think Sunkissed
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in New York is a sustainable way
to launch an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ireland is almost the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're lucky, you'll get a couple of
good weeks during the summer or I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think you can plan around having real
cultivation unless you've got the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: that has proven for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would negate that indoor cannabis is
going to be the premium cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be able to buy on the
shelves over the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having spent time in Ireland,
I pretty much, I think of like Northeast
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, Northeast United States,
very similar to the climate in Ireland.
And I think that's a great thing because
you get the rain and ice.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Minus we get the snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys get the rain and ice,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I think that there
are some serious lessons learned and look,
[SPEAKER_01]: the state did a great thing by launching
this program and getting product out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting some folks who have some real
bona fides or skill set to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it takes a very special strain
breed and cultivator to understand and
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't Jack in the Beanstalk where
you're going to throw some seeds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground and then you're going to be
magically wealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very fickle plant and it's tough to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that some of the farmers in
New York learned that lesson this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they'll have the retail
stores open by the end of this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll have a few just so they can
check the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they have awarded the card
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave out 36 licenses for the justice
impacted individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just coming fresh off the press,
we had a meeting last night with Damian
[SPEAKER_01]: Fagan and the OCM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that they're going to
have by the end of the year, we'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: two, maybe three stores open in various
regions and they'll be the pilot flagship
[SPEAKER_01]: first to market stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think the caliber of cannabis
being grown in New York is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to meet that top tier echelon or is
it just now?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that we're going to struggle a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and to be honest with you with getting
the top tier and that's what happens,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell people it's not about speed
to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started this whole conversation by
talking about the spirit of collaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: with legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when we've left legacy behind
on this first round, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: tough to compete with the product that
currently exists in 80% of the market
[SPEAKER_01]: space that currently is dominated in the
legacy market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like, you know, 400,000 metric
tons of cannabis or some ridiculous four
[SPEAKER_01]: metric tons of cannabis is consumed in the
New York metropolitan area.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of it is sold in stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just tells you it's a ridiculous
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there's going to be like
interstate partnerships that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of the East Coast,
we were looking at the ballots recently in
[SPEAKER_00]: votes that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of close neighboring
states that have all gone legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see them doing interstate deals
where, look, we're allowed to ship across
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B and C and D without breaking the
federal rules?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the framework for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a big I'm a big proponent of
interstate commerce amongst contiguous
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's the only way that we
can compete and really open up the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace in a way that gives unique
distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you buy Vermont maple syrup and you
buy New York apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's the same concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we learned coming through the
pandemic is that the states can do
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate commerce on emergency supplies,
medical supplies, and even labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor could work across state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the framework for it in the in the
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania pact
[SPEAKER_01]: for the the the Port Authority,
where we share in revenue and taxation for
[SPEAKER_01]: highways, bridges and tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's the same model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the same model when it comes
to tomatoes, apples, oranges and produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if cannabis is truly an agricultural
commodity, then let's just designate it as
[SPEAKER_01]: such and allow for contiguous states to
trade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about the revenue pool when you
when you expand the marketplace by,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, five million users just in the
tri-state area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can expand that and then they can do a
revenue share on the taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it won't be long before the
governments get that get that message.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is it will increase
safety, consumer protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Product safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have standardized tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what works in New York will have to be
the standard for New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_01]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, Vermont, you know,
and and look, we're going further south
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have legalization in in Maryland
and, you know, Virginia's coming on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: is is is hot, a hot button with being a
federal territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as we see this thing expand
on the eastern seaboard, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a need for some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a need for for
standardized testing and and secure
[SPEAKER_01]: banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this that's that model opens up
so many doors to answer and check off so
[SPEAKER_01]: many boxes that create areas of
opportunity or problem for our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, very well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's been amazing chatting to you,
Ruben.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could actually talk to you in another
couple of episodes, but hopefully we get
[SPEAKER_00]: to touch base in twenty twenty three and
see how black bar farms are getting on and
[SPEAKER_00]: the progress you guys are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you very much for taking your
time today for anybody who wants to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruben on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's run fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nineteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link will be in all the different
descriptions where it's posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again, Ruben, for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe out there until next episode,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
Oh.
