[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody to the next episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Mike Crawford, who's the co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: The Young Jerks, who's an award-winning
podcast based in Boston, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
quick little overview of your position in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and how you guys came to set
up The Young Jerks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been around for like 20 plus
years as an advocate for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an old athlete, wrestler,
amateur wrestler, college wrestler,
[SPEAKER_01]: hurt my back, and also had cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have like two uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use medical cannabis for like 25 years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually more than that, 30 years really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been active for like probably
about 25 years and did a lot with a local
[SPEAKER_01]: normal chapter, MassCan Normal at that
time, the Boston Freedom Rally,
[SPEAKER_01]: booked their event for a number of years,
10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on their board, two-term president.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nonprofit for cannabis reform in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're the largest one on, you know,
pretty much on the East coast of the
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did that for a number of years,
and then I got into podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And The Young Jerks has been going for
nine years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to do a studio show, but now we're
doing a live stream yard show,
[SPEAKER_01]: take phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really have been covering,
you know, the show for The Young Jerks is
[SPEAKER_01]: really about representing communities and
people that don't get a platform or are
[SPEAKER_01]: being ignored a lot of times by the larger
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on this, cannabis workers has just
risen to the top for us lately,
[SPEAKER_01]: just due to the fact that there's so much
issues in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what we've been covering
over the last year and really what's been
[SPEAKER_01]: getting us like out there and known and
you know, in a lot of media.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last year we've, you know,
it's funny because we used to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: media for, you know, decrim, medical,
legal, the initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when everything passed,
it was like the corporations were getting
[SPEAKER_01]: all the media, not us, the activists.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the last year, it just totally changed
based on the worker issue, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you guys have definitely made a name
for yourself for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first topic I want to talk about was
an overview of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a quick
little review of what's the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the medical cannabis market look
like in that state?
[SPEAKER_00]: And any pertinent information you think
everybody would like to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've had billions of sales on the
adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Massachusetts 2008, we did
decriminalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just amazing to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when I was involved in MassCan
and nobody here thought that could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we knew the poll numbers had changed
like 10 years before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't have won that initiative,
but the people's mind had changed about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew the poll numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won that campaign two to one,
you know, 60 over 65, 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 2012, we did a medical cannabis
initiative and we won that one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that changed the law to allow people to
have medical cards to grow their own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and also to buy from stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it didn't really give us a
lot of options in terms of caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really large, big cannabis
stores that opened with people that had a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of money, millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we did legalization 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single one of these initiatives
was funded by Big Money Marijuana Policy
[SPEAKER_01]: Project, a national organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the locals, we were limited on what
actually we wanted to be included in those
[SPEAKER_01]: initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we did make
sure that we added was the option for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to do the home cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's become a big fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing about Massachusetts is
that we can grow six plants per person,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 in a household.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a home, a private
residence, you can grow inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a legal adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's been mostly big cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been strides with equity to allow
smaller players into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to work, I believe,
but there's still a lot of issues and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of bad investment in the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard for smaller players to
open now and actually survive because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're competing against big companies
that have over invested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like we look at Trulief,
who's leaving the state right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're closing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the largest cannabis company in
Florida, the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They own that market and they came to
Massachusetts and they didn't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually, one of their employees
died on the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cover that extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Trulief, one of the largest companies
that's decided to move out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, which is, Massachusetts
isn't big geography wise, but it's not too
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we got Western Mass too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern part of the state has really built
up a lot of suburbs and they get the city
[SPEAKER_01]: of Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in Central Mass, you got the city of
Worcester.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cities in Boston, all over
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an urban dense population,
especially in the Eastern side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got about, I think, eight
million people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a good population, but a lot of
large companies like Trulief pulled out
[SPEAKER_01]: and now they're dumping all their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dumping all their product at maybe
25% of what they would normally price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other companies are having a hard time
competing with that, with companies going
[SPEAKER_01]: out of business doing, and they're not the
only ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other companies too, large
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have kind of an over saturation at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prices are dropping, which is good,
but a lot of the product still sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself, I'm a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a medical cannabis card.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the state of Maine, they allow you to
actually go up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any state resident from any state in the
country can drive to Maine or fly into
[SPEAKER_01]: Maine and get served in their medical
cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why would I do that when Massachusetts
is legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because their program is so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason their program is better is
because they allow thousands of smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: caregivers to open up there with little
red tape, no millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you have is you have more like
a farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have better product, better service,
better quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to the guy who runs the business
that I go to up there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in direct contact with him all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to find that in a big
dispensary chain in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big difference, I think,
in what we're talking about when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts did not do it right,
I feel like, except for the homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to fix it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a great opportunity to
actually fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the bureaucracy and the
invested interests make it very difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: to do so here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see over here in Europe,
this homegrown might be getting allowed in
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of different countries to,
let's say, placate the activist side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's viable for patients to
be able to grow their own home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see it as successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but it's limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially where I live in Massachusetts,
they made the law so that you can only do
[SPEAKER_01]: it at your residence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't rent out a space at a U-Haul or
maybe a medical facility that wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: rent you space to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people in Massachusetts are either
renters, they live in dorms, they live in
[SPEAKER_01]: government housing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most landlords are not going to allow
you to grow in your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to own your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you own a condo, a lot of
times there's condo association rules
[SPEAKER_01]: against you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of instances when,
if you're living especially in government
[SPEAKER_01]: housing, your elderly housing,
those folks aren't generally allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in their home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does help a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's definitely something that
everyone should have in any law that they
[SPEAKER_01]: pass, that you need a homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to go beyond that because the
mistake that we made in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: we thought homegrown was enough,
not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you really need is to allow everyone
to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not licensing somebody within
six months or less, that's what the state
[SPEAKER_01]: of Maine does.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to get licensed from the
medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get licensed usually in 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, it takes three to five
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that three to five year period,
you're paying for consultants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to actually rent or own the
property that you're hoping in three to
[SPEAKER_01]: five years that the state and the city
will allow you to actually open in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rents in Massachusetts are
astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know folks who have been spending
$10,000, $20,000, $5,000, you name them
[SPEAKER_01]: amount a month for five years,
they're bankrupt and they're still not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to close before they
even get to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens all the time in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you end up with is these big
predatory corporations that have all the
[SPEAKER_01]: money and they have all the real estate,
but they don't care about their workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis especially, this is a
plant that needs love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs the smaller batches is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I drive to Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prices are almost comparable now in
Maine and Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why do I go to Maine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Product is so much better and you've got
to allow smaller folks to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, call it caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Maine did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They licensed thousands of caregivers
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 3,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small state up in Maine,
3,000 legal caregivers in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Massachusetts, we might have a couple
hundred corporations here, large
[SPEAKER_01]: corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the difference when you have,
and then Maine, they did the 3,000
[SPEAKER_01]: caregivers first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They licensed them first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then five to 10 years later,
they let the larger corporations in.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Massachusetts, we did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said larger corporations first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that every state, every nation
has to consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're shutting out your local
people, this is one of my friends lives in
[SPEAKER_01]: the city of Malden, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been trying to open in his city for
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he's had to sue the city of
Malden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did the city of Malden do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They decided to license out of state,
out of town, larger corporations,
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger players with more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we see over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those folks don't care about the
quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about the safety of their
employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my advice is home grow and
license everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: License everybody as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic I want to begin to is the
Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this stack up?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already talked to the director of
Oklahoma's version of this, the director
[SPEAKER_00]: from Colorado's version.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know New York seemed to be the golden
child with their acquired licenses and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the guys at the Cannabis Control
Commission in Massachusetts stacking up on
[SPEAKER_00]: a nationwide level?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're stacking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they could compete with
Maine's medical cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that says it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever designed that medical cannabis
program in Maine, they deserve the award
[SPEAKER_01]: on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Massachusetts, it seems like they get
a lot of praise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like because they have created
billions of dollars of revenue,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I feel like that's a drop in the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have had so much more revenue if
they had just licensed everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like Maine is leading their
medical program and Massachusetts is
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like unfortunately a lot of
states have looked at Massachusetts being
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the earliest and not looked at
Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of states have modeled themselves
after the Massachusetts model,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the equity stuff, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real equity is licensing everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give everyone an opportunity and it
doesn't cost millions of dollars,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about no taxation on people who are
arrested too?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the equity proposals that I
don't see that are very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we should be rewarding the
folks like even myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a white guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should I have to pay tax on adult use?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to give equity, think of new
ideas that touch more people than just a
[SPEAKER_01]: few rich folks who have the right
demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over in Ireland, we have a Citizens'
Assembly happening at the moment that
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully is going to come back with some
positive recommendations for
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalizing or even legalizing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top three takeaways that we should
be looking at are small-grow works better
[SPEAKER_00]: than large-grow, open to everybody and a
limited timeframe to apply for a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else that I'm missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think taxation too should be
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that cutting in locals is a
good idea, but one of the issues we had in
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts is that the law was so
ambiguous and it was changed by the state
[SPEAKER_01]: leaders after we passed it that there was
a lot of questions about how much tax the
[SPEAKER_01]: local towns could actually take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a lot of lawsuits and
fights about that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be very specific about taxation
and limit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them something though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a local city or town should get
something for opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maine, I love what Maine does that for
medical cannabis, I go back to their
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis program in Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no state tax on the medical,
which I don't think there should ever be
[SPEAKER_01]: tax on medical cannabis, but if you're
going to do it, do it like Maine does,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a small little local tax,
little city tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like less than 5% on the medical
sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of incentivizes the cities and
towns to allow it and take the revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, it's been great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If only these were twice as long,
these episodes forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great to be on a podcast from
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an absolute pleasure to talk to
you and hopefully have some Irish products
[SPEAKER_00]: over in Boston, Massachusetts in the next
24 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, thank you very much, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much appreciated and catch you in the
next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
