[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to The Cannabis Review,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by Alexi
Pikovsky, the CEO and co-founder of Alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have heard a lot of noise about
this company over the last while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making plenty of waves in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alexi, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to have you on the show,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking forward to having you on
and learning a lot more about Alpha Green
Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kick things off with pretty
much a simple start first topic and give
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody an overview of how you got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell everybody the story of Alpha
Green Group and how you got to here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the story starts actually with me
looking into a bunch of industries,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of companies as an investment
banker at the Moora and the M&A team in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2011, and then spending six years as an
investor for various family offices and a
[SPEAKER_01]: private equity fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically seeing cannabis doing
extremely well in Canada and the US around
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019 and thinking to myself, OK,
there is nothing big or nothing in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of high quality companies in the UK,
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I spend a month traveling Canada
and California talking to more than 50
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and realize that there is a
market to have a platform in Europe to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer top brands to European and UK
customers and provide them with the top
[SPEAKER_01]: brands, be it the US brands, Canadian
brands or UK brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was really the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, it was kind of like,
OK, what's the team?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a super strong co-founder and CTO,
and he was the CTO of a copycat of Etsy in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pitched him the idea and said,
look, do you want to join me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we launched Alpha Green in October
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think having a good co-founder is
hugely important to the success of your
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprise, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good overview for everybody now
on the Alpha Green group.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd like to do is chat about the
current landscape of CBD in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The novel food licenses, that's really
gone through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that they pushed back the deadline
again there last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us what you think the CBD
landscape looks like in the UK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it promising?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the regulations going in your favor,
or is it like the rest of, not even
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, but Ireland seems to be living in
the Stone Age when it comes to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the UK is making progress, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: With FSA pushing out the deadline,
ultimately gives some brands more time to
[SPEAKER_01]: submit their dossier.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the novel food application,
we do see that the landscape is huge,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more than 500 brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just on Alpha Green, we have more
than 100 UK based CBD brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also know that probably 70% of them
are getting their ingredients from kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like five suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you see is that as long as
these five suppliers are getting their
[SPEAKER_01]: novel food application validated,
let's say 70% of brands will be safe,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, of course, that whole
novel food process brings a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say problems, because it then
questions the, it then basically makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of kind of you ask players
launching a brand suddenly in the UK much
[SPEAKER_01]: harder because they, the FSA can then
argue, okay, well, you've not been on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market before February, wherever 2020,
and you haven't submitted your
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't actually launch a brand,
which obviously is kind of like against
[SPEAKER_01]: the free market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be interesting to see,
but I think the fact that there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: novel food application and that there is
actually some sort of clarity how you get
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant is already better than what's
happening in Europe, where the European
[SPEAKER_01]: court decided CBD is not a narcotic,
which was great for industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, the European court
didn't actually say, well, it's a food,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it remains somehow a gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do see from time to time,
certain rates on the retail market in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, where suddenly all the product is
now illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one month later, the same
retailer puts all the same products back
[SPEAKER_01]: on the retail shelf saying, actually now
it's legal again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this kind of zigzag strategy
in Europe, which doesn't really help
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that sense, I think UK is definitely
a bit ahead of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ireland, as you say, right,
I think Ireland is an interesting market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is a super interesting market
from, if you look at THC habits,
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics, it's probably the highest kind
of usage market for THC, like the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: black market THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 20% of the population is using
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so statistics, I saw it in the
Prohibition Partners newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure how accurate it is,
but ultimately you can argue that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge culture in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: But around the regulations, it's probably
closer to what Europe is doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: not much clarity versus what the UK is
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think there's definitely a
little bit of lack of enthusiasm from the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians here in Ireland to kind of act
on what is being applied across European
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland seems to be just lagging behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's still some of the
scenarios you could pipe down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police are raiding places that are
selling CBD flour and the police don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a clue what CBD flour compared to THC
or flour looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to them, it's just it's cannabis or
it's weed and they need to lock down on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's more having clarity from
the government that a bit of education and
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of training and being able to know
the differences or even being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply for a certain license might be able
to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you might be able to clear up
for me, and it's almost like swimming in
[SPEAKER_00]: muddy water when you go through the novel
food license applications and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The novel food for the UK, does that apply
to the EU or did the EU have a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: separate novel food license that UK
companies will have to have as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK one?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the novel food application right now is
only good for the UK one because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: under the UK FSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: The European has the EFSA, so the European
Food Incentive Authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess you can kind of submit the
same application, but you need to submit
[SPEAKER_01]: it to a separate authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to now finish on our last topic
and that's some of the success stories
[SPEAKER_00]: recently and the listings on the London
Stock Exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: How excited are you guys about the future
of the listings over there and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: IPOs that may be happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's definitely good for the
industry that you see a lot more capital
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into it and cannabis becoming,
well, an investable let's say industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you obviously had Cannibal IPO-ing at
6.5 pence and now it's trading at 400
[SPEAKER_01]: percent up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I think north of 25 pence or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's doing extremely well despite
actually having, well, a lot of sales to,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, back the story up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the prospectus at that 14
thousand pounds of revenue last year and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's trading at more than 100 million
market cap now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it's exciting that you have this
hype and this flow of capital,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also very, let's say cautious to say,
OK, these are the companies who are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the winners in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I don't want is obviously a lot
of retail investors to suddenly lose a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of money now and kind of like right off
cannabis when actually cannabis then
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes a much bigger industry and should
be a really big sector also for kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: institutional investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in summary, yeah, you had three
IPOs in the last three weeks doing
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seller Goods, MGC Pharma and Cannibal.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I'm still very cautious
on how the market will perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they actually see some of the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, tell me this and tell me no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the European cannabis
industry is going to be pharmacy based for
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and for sales and kept to a
medical or can you see full on
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries like they have over North
America?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the North American
market, it's very much split into yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have CVS pharmacy distributing some of
the CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also some of the medical cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have medical cannabis
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So purely medical cannabis, especially in
states where there is no recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once there is recreational in a
state, so, for example, let's say New
[SPEAKER_01]: York, which is about to go wreck,
you see medical cannabis dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: flipping to recreational dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reason being that the same customer can
then still buy the medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: show their, let's say, prescription and
get the government to reimburse some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you also open up to
a much larger market, which is the wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually think a similar evolution
will happen in Europe and the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the exception that the medical market
is still tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you actually don't even have medical
dispensaries, neither you have pharmacies
[SPEAKER_01]: who are selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have pharmacies who can dispense
it, but it's a very, very little number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead what you have, you have
already, let's say vape shops,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD shops, and you have just a much more
developed online market for the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: products, which is very different,
again, to the North American market,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's much more THC in terms of
kind of like heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so online was never very big because
it was kind of, well, because you needed
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick up the product or you needed to go
to the stores so the online was much more
[SPEAKER_01]: about finding the strain in a certain
dispensary rather than actually buying the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain and getting it delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I see the UK evolving is you
will have still the online market being
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very dominant when it comes to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will then gradually have pharmacies
opening up to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then down the line, you will
definitely see the CBD shops and vape
[SPEAKER_01]: shops of today converting to some sort of
dispensary structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, that will be three,
four, five years in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've started to see a lot of,
even over here, some of the CBD stores now
[SPEAKER_00]: call themselves CBD dispensaries and
starting to offer a CBD flower under 0.2%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a step in the right
direction for allowing the free markets
[SPEAKER_00]: and dispensaries owned by competent human
beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone through a full regulatory
process to apply for a license to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring to the market, as opposed to
limiting to pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know will be inferior cannabis
if it does go that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hopefully it goes the way of the
free markets and it all goes well for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few years for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alexi, I want to thank you very much for
coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man, so I won't keep
you too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get to chat again in the
next few months and we'll do a catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot more positive news for
us to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you very much for coming
