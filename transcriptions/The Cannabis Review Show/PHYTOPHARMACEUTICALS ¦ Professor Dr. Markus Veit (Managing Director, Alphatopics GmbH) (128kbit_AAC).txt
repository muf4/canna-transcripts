[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
The Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Professor Dr Marcus Veit, who's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Managing Director at Alpha Topics GmbH.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Per Heiser?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Joel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be happy to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much for taking your
time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will keep this brief and to the
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a brief
overview on your career to date?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did a normal university career and
I left university when I was a young
[SPEAKER_01]: professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, I took over the general
manager position of a small laboratory,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was founded for a research project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the starting of a founding of
different companies providing services for
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmaceutical industry in terms of
quality control and regulatory affairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meanwhile, I'm 63 and only one
company is left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Alpha Topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this company, I do training for
the pharmaceutical industry related to any
[SPEAKER_01]: topic which you can think of in the
context of quality, control,
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing, chemistry of all kinds of
pharmaceutical products and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do also some consultancy,
but only in these topics I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in and I like and cannabis is
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also related to my
professorship because I'm a professor of
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacognosy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my university career and education is
related to herbal medicine and products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe explain to everybody the
first topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are phyto pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is something very special in
Europe and the European Union because we
[SPEAKER_01]: do have herbal products as medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part of our regulatory environment
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in principle also possible in
other regions in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in Europe, it's distinct because
we do have clear guidelines how to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with these products considering the very
specific aspects related to these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any product which is manufactured
out of a plant or as plant material and
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not a purified compound is
considered to be a phyto pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So degree of purification is sometimes a
matter of debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the margin could be drawn
at a purity of 90 to 95 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have natural compounds of that
purity, they are no longer considered to
[SPEAKER_01]: be phyto pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phyto pharmaceuticals are mainly
mixtures of compounds contained in
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts prepared from herbal starting
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these extracts or other preparations
are then manufactured in normal dosage
[SPEAKER_01]: forms like capsules, tablets, liquid
dosage forms and form an own category
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called herbal medicinal product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have even a distinct committee at
EMA at our European Medicines Agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Herbal Medicinal Product
Committee responsible for this group of
[SPEAKER_01]: products and very distinct guidance
documents for these products and also
[SPEAKER_01]: distinct approval procedures in EU member
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does the biosynthesis via
fermentation, is that covered under phyto
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in normal cases, there is no
fermentation at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a normal phyto pharmaceutical,
you take a plant material from cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: or sometimes it's still collected in the
wild, then you try it, then you mill it
[SPEAKER_01]: and this milled material is then
extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The extract might be purified and maybe
also standardized to distinct ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: and this extract then is manufactured in a
dosage form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fermentation sometimes is also part of
the manufacture, but these are very rare
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you explain what are the benefits
of phyto pharmaceuticals versus let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: a synthetic molecule?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's difficult to have it
summarized under benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something different because it's
therapy with multi-component mixtures and
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, one can postulate synergistic
and maybe also antagonistic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, it's not a single pure
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a complete different concept of
medical use of these kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, we do have a long
tradition of these products in quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: EU member states and this tradition builds
the basis to have these products as
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain on the second topic,
what is the European Pharmacopia?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the European Pharmacopia is a
compendium which is issued by the EDQM.
[SPEAKER_01]: EDQM stands for European Directorate for
the Quality of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This EDQM is located in Strasbourg and
it's part of the Council of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has nothing to do with the European
Union because it was founded after Second
[SPEAKER_01]: World War and at this time, there was no
European Union at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this time, a decision must be taken
which organization in Europe could be
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible to build up a Pharmacopia
which is not dedicated to a single EU
[SPEAKER_01]: member state or a single state in Europe
but is valid in any European country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this time, the Council of Europe
was the only organization in place and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore, this organization which is
normally in charge for human rights and
[SPEAKER_01]: other topics far away from pharmaceuticals
was assigned to take over this
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, at this time, there were
12 European countries, Switzerland
[SPEAKER_01]: included for example, which is not an EU
member state and they signed the so-called
[SPEAKER_01]: European Pharmacopia Convention and this
convention was the basis for this European
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacopia and today we do have 46
European countries following the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacopia and the European Pharmacopia
provides standards for active
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical ingredients, for packaging
material, for excipients and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues related to quality control and
stability testing of pharmaceutical raw
[SPEAKER_01]: materials and products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a clear reference in the European
legislative environment making these
[SPEAKER_01]: definitions and requirements in the
European Pharmacopia legally binding for
[SPEAKER_01]: any EU country having signed the
Pharmacopia Convention and it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, a lot of products which are well
known and no longer under patent
[SPEAKER_01]: protection are included into the
Pharmacopia and quality standards are
[SPEAKER_01]: defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are still national
Pharmacopias, Ireland, UK, Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, France, Poland and other EU
states do have still national Pharmacopias
[SPEAKER_01]: but with the times, the European
Pharmacopia gets bigger and the national
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacopias get smaller because at this
time when something is included in the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Pharmacopia, it will be deleted
from the national Pharmacopias.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the role that the EMA
plays in drug discovery and development,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you maybe give everybody a brief
little overview of if somebody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically develop their own drug or their
own active pharmaceutical ingredient,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it go through the European Medical
Agency for approval and what are the main
[SPEAKER_00]: steps for this to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we still in Europe do have
not EU approval for any products.
[SPEAKER_01]: This EU wide approval in the 27 member
states is only open for certain products.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, vaccines, everybody knows
that because of the pandemic, they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be approved by EMA and also if you have
new therapies or you have distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: indications like neuroprotective agents or
neurodegenerative illness, this needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be approved through this so-called
centralized procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The normal approval and this would also be
the case for cannabis is not achieved by
[SPEAKER_01]: EMA because for herbal medicinal products,
they are not considered to be new chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: entities, they are considered known herbal
products and for this, you have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through national procedures in single EU
member states or you can also decide to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a so-called decentralized procedure
which means that you apply for approval in
[SPEAKER_01]: a group of EU member states, you can
select and then you will select one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: member states as being the so-called
reference member state responsible for the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If further cannabis herbal medicinal
products will be developed, my expectation
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they will not be approved by EMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be the case if this cannabis
medicine will be developed for diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: which have to go through EMA, for example
cancer product has to go through EMA but
[SPEAKER_01]: in the moment there is no cancer
indication for cannabis, it is more
[SPEAKER_01]: related to indications which are not
needed to be approved by EMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of news and reports of some
biotechnology companies being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop inflammation drugs whether it's
for cardiovascular disease or for bowel
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, are these products that get
approved by EMA?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the indication, there's a
list of indication but normal vascular
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases are not part of this list so it
must be a severe illness and an illness
[SPEAKER_01]: for which it was decided that it must be
available if it's developed for all
[SPEAKER_01]: patients in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download this list from the
internet and it's part of a European
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation what needs to go through EMA,
what could go through EMA and what could
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis medicines, phytomedicines will
only be able to be approved by EMA if
[SPEAKER_01]: there is really an indication of a severe
illness or for example if cannabis would
[SPEAKER_01]: be antiviral then also a centralized
procedure could be chosen but in the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment I have no indication, maybe often
indications must also go through EMA,
[SPEAKER_01]: often means this is an indication of a
rare disease and this is also something
[SPEAKER_01]: which is approved by EMA so this could be
possible and biotech is not phytomedicine
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's very often a misunderstanding so
biotech they develop very often biological
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines which are not
phyto-pharmaceuticals so
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto-pharmaceuticals are characterized by
the way of their manufacture I have
[SPEAKER_01]: summarized a couple minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly before I let you go when it
comes to the ingredient side of these
[SPEAKER_00]: potential new medical products that are
going to be created from cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules within the cannabis plant is the
most advantageous option synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented biosynthesis or a
phyto-pharmaceutical that comes from a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant which is the most advantageous route
do you see happening in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Advantages depends on what is the target
of development so it could be both so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look for innovation and being on the
edge of the knife regarding innovation of
[SPEAKER_01]: course isolated cannabinoids or maybe also
synthesized molecules which are similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids or partial modified molecules
originating from cannabinoids they might
[SPEAKER_01]: be considered to be innovative products
and the normal extract from cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: other preparation might be more or less
more regarded as something which comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: of traditional medicine but which could be
further developed of course in a more
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly before I let you go what are
the things you look forward to seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: most over the next let's say five year
period when it comes to cannabis based
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm involved in quite a few projects
aiming to develop cannabis medicines in
[SPEAKER_01]: different indications and from my
perspective this is very important that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is done because in the moment in
these EU member states in which cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines are allowed they are distributed
to the patients based on single patient
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription and in Germany for example as
Margit just to preparations without any
[SPEAKER_01]: approvals is a kind of a so-called no
label use because there is no real
[SPEAKER_01]: approval process and there is only limited
evidence so we need evidence we need
[SPEAKER_01]: approved medicines and with availability
of these approved medicines we will then
[SPEAKER_01]: not only have these approved medicines in
the approved indications but we will also
[SPEAKER_01]: have a kind of a no label use which is
better than off label use because if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a no label use safety has been proven
and approved not necessarily efficacy but
[SPEAKER_01]: this is an important next step to get more
in the moment we only have Sativex as a
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto medicine and we do have of course
Epidiolex and synthesized cannabis THC
[SPEAKER_01]: products but we need further cannabis
medicines in order to to further establish
[SPEAKER_01]: data on safety and efficacy in different
indications there's a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: dream and wish in this whole industry and
we need evidence yeah I couldn't agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with you more fact-based evidence is
paramount now in the European industry it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be a lot of people picking
themselves up without any real evidence to
[SPEAKER_01]: back behind their claims yes we need
evidence so and this is very often very
[SPEAKER_01]: often not given for cannabis medicines and
yeah well our time is up now and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a very busy man so I'd like to
thank you very much professor for taking
[SPEAKER_00]: your time to do this today for anybody
wants to learn more about alpha topics you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see the website below I highly
recommend checking out the website and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on linkedin adding professor bait
bite as a connection professor thank you
