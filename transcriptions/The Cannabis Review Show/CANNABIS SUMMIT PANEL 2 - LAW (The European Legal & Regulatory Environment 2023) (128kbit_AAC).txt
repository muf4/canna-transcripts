[SPEAKER_04]: So, on behalf of the INCBA, the
International Cannabis Bar Sincere,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the representative body of
lawyers who operate in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to warmly introduce to you our
next panel of speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: First up is a man who is very,
very well known as an authority on the
[SPEAKER_04]: area of cannabis law in Europe and beyond,
and that is Friedrich Miermann from
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany, Marie Sanchez, also well-renowned
and including all our other speakers who
[SPEAKER_04]: are also part, Marie is from France,
Robert Jappe from London, and of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel Heyman from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a quick word about the INCBA.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the representative association,
again, of lawyers who operate in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've now, I think over 1000 lawyers
spread across North America, Europe and
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so today's panel of discussion is,
of course, the European legal and
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory environment in the 2023.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to introduce myself again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of you are familiar with me
at this point, probably sick of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, the format for today is we
have the presentations from our speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then towards the end, we have a
entrance and answers session.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without further ado, if you would put
your hands together and welcome Kai
[SPEAKER_04]: Friedrich Miermann as our first speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Neil, and your own
pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I prepared some slides for you,
some information for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stop me if I'm getting too long
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, let's see where we know what we
can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm talking about a little bit about
hand medical and adult use cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you a little overview and
regulatory overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you might know, Germany is going to
legalize in the next coming month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coalition agreement of the new
government in 2021, so they agreed on
[SPEAKER_00]: distributing recreational cannabis to
adults in licensed shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the goal of the new government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had one year of intense debates on
how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first and foremost goal is health
protection is the primary goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think cannabis legalization in
Germany, you have to think health
[SPEAKER_00]: protection at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every decision you make, you have to keep
that goal in mind, as well as child and
[SPEAKER_00]: youth protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And product quality and product
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, with the fight against the
illegal market and crime displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the magic number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We estimate a demand of 400 tons plus X of
dried flowers alone for the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 500 tons if the tourists are
allowed to purchase recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an extreme huge market,
we expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the medical market,
we imported 25 tons of dried flowers in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you see how much of cannabis is
needed for the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is how to secure the supply
chain for medical, for recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one proposition by the Green
Party that it is limited to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor cultivation in Germany,
is that possible at all under these
[SPEAKER_00]: climate conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have the right genetics for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that this is possible in
Switzerland, but on a large scale in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, I think it's questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor cultivation, on the other hand,
is extremely energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate protection aspects, you have to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your glass house production,
is that a middle route?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a middle way to secure production
in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: All questions are still open, are still
debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the imports is another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you want to import your recreational
cannabis to Germany, you have to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: a single convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: One proposition is to terminate the single
convention and re-entry under reservation
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, like Bolivia did for the coca
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can think about the inter-sea
modification procedure without
[SPEAKER_00]: denunciation of the single convention and
with the conclusion of trade agreements
[SPEAKER_00]: between the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some call it the most elegant way out,
but then you have to identify,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, potential international trading
partners, maybe like Canada or Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is these agreements take a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe two years, three years,
four years, it's very complicated to agree
[SPEAKER_00]: on such an international trade treaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this doesn't solve the problem of
product availability in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the EU law, just to scratch
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this framework decision,
which obliges the European member states
[SPEAKER_00]: to prohibit and to prohibit the trade of
cannabis, as long as it is without
[SPEAKER_00]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have legal scholars saying,
if you legalize nationally, domestically,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is with authorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another point is imports and foreign
trade agreements is that under EU
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction, did the member states
delegate this competence to the EU?
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is highly disputed in these,
every question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If determination is possible, if an
inter-sea modification procedure is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, because the single convention
was agreed on before this Article 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to get a way through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the German government came up with an
idea with this so-called interpretive
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They issued a key point paper in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything I tell is about the status
of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the end of February now,
major developments coming up in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me if my predictions are
obsolete in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is that, this interpretative
statement?
[SPEAKER_00]: So legalization under strict conditions of
state regulation and improvement of health
[SPEAKER_00]: and use protection is compatible with the
goals of the drug conventions from 61,
[SPEAKER_00]: 72, and 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the government is invoking the German
legal order, the case law of the Supreme
[SPEAKER_00]: Court, and the declaration at the time of
the ratification of the 1988 agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aforementioned grounds of the legal
order are subject to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exactly this change has happened now
in 2022 and 3, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are not talking about terminating
the single convention, or they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about right now about inter-sea
modification procedures or all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just take a firm stance and say,
we interpretate the treaties that
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for our people, it's better
for our community, and can achieve more
[SPEAKER_00]: health protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consequences that the cultivation must
take place in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: No imports for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 400, 500 tons have to be produced,
have to be cultivated in Germany as it
[SPEAKER_00]: stands right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This interpretative statement is discussed
with the EU Commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to find a solution right
now, and they're trying to find a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there is also discussed right now in
Plan B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan B would be decommunization of
cannabis, of recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the allowance of homegrown and collective
homegrown in cannabis solar plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is privileged under the EU,
UN treaties, and under EU law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not the goal of the
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of the government, as I explained
earlier, was licensed stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled quality to really ensure
consumer protection through tested
[SPEAKER_00]: products in a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I think this interpretation
solution is a bold step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Bourgoy invoked human rights,
and they still stand, they still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: firm stance on these human rights
interpretation, similar to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further development, of course,
remains to be seen at UN and EU level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the health minister wants to have a
European expertise, which is also
[SPEAKER_00]: published with the first draft in March,
to convince the other EU member states
[SPEAKER_00]: that the German way is the better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the federal drug commissioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is traveling all over Europe,
and he's in talks with all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: health ministers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Luxembourg, Malta, Czech Republic,
Spain, Netherlands, Portugal, they all
[SPEAKER_00]: want another direction in cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they get together and work on a new
solution, then maybe we see also a change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the EU law, in this framework decision,
so that all European member states can
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize cannabis on a safe ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consequence without imports,
market at the beginning, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without products, no cannabis stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't get a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine when you can't prove that
you have product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have no product, you can't get a
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first ones who have product in the
market will have an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we also see a vertically integrated
value chain, if the ones who have the
[SPEAKER_00]: first product get the first license as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the production in Germany will
be a challenge in terms of logistic and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the best solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a good solution, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that the German government,
which is doing right now these intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: talks to the EU member states,
that we find another solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imports must be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine how that should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe a solution would be home
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have a seed trade in Spain,
in the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a large market for equipment,
for homegrown equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis social club model is also
a route which may make sense, so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have them big cities like Hamburg or
Berlin, social clubs with 500,000 members
[SPEAKER_00]: and their own production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not clear right now how this
will be regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in a flow right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and of course, low threshold and
then generous licensing of cultivation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this must be, as the key point paper
of the government says, must be in
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance with the sustainability goals
of the German government, which are the UN
[SPEAKER_00]: goals of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to have a windmill next to
your indoor production facility or a
[SPEAKER_00]: photovoltaic or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you probably can't meet a zero carbon
facility because it's just too intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of questions we have to solve in
the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The schedule is like, we're expecting now
in March the first draft of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said before, the draft will be
probably in two phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Plan B first, decommunization,
homegrown and collective homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the commercialized value chain will
come in a further step, in a second step
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expecting this Plan B to be
implemented in June before the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: break of Bundestag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the further notice period
for cultivation licenses and retail
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're expecting a federal Supreme
Court decision also in March on the
[SPEAKER_00]: legality of the ban of cannabis in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So March will be a decisive month for the
further developments in Germany and for
[SPEAKER_00]: the final plan of the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, CBD market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD market, the CBD hype is definitely
over in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enforcement of the noble food
regulations since 2019 work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only have a few products on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still left and you can't CBD oil market no
longer as food, but mainly as a cosmetic
[SPEAKER_00]: oral care product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that on the shelves of the big
drug store chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still see partly prosecution on the
ground of the Lakotic Act against CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a fight going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need these clarification with the
new law to really make clear that the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a problem anymore for these kinds
of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD flowers, hemp leaf tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have the proceeding, chemical
proceedings against these products as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My office has sued the, for two clients,
sued the German government in the
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative court of Braunschweig on
the grounds of the free movement of goods
[SPEAKER_00]: principle because CBD flowers are legal in
Luxembourg and Belgium and Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp leaf tea the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but this is still pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the final clarification with the
legalization and the change of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is marketable is CBD cosmetics and
CBD e-liquids if no health claims are
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these products are on the market and
are safe on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some important court decisions in
the last year, CBD as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the court said if you have a product
which exceeds 18 mg CBD as a daily intake,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FSA in the UK says 70 and 18,
that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that does conflict with the court
rulings of the ECG because you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: significant threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another court decision was that
cosmetic oral care sprays, like you see
[SPEAKER_00]: over there, you see cosmetic
Muenpflegespray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the only route you can market
CBD oils right now because cosmetic
[SPEAKER_00]: studies find out that CBD has an
antibacterial effect for treating your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth, the cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, but this is also at this point
in the dispute right now if this route
[SPEAKER_00]: will prevail, will be decided this year as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, some words to medical cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can export medical cannabis to
Germany in principle from every other
[SPEAKER_00]: country in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to have medical cannabis
production under state control and the
[SPEAKER_00]: state has to establish a cannabis agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the product has to have these
GACP and EU GMP properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must met these auto legs for
regulations and the German monographies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a deviation of 10% allowed in
terms of the specification made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And patient numbers is about 120,000 right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact figure is not documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market is 200 million euros plus 30 to
60 million euros for the private payer
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still a very small market in terms of
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had this, this is the development of
the imports of dried flowers into Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see from 2017 to 2022, the constant
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most prescription are for pain 73% and
spasticity, et cetera, multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, these are the import
countries for dried flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada still with 38%, Netherlands 26%,
Denmark and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the left-hand side is the dried
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most of the dried, of the extracts
are coming from Portugal right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the range of the different
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green is dried flowers and the blue
ones are the preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below that is Ecolidex, Kinamex,
Lattebex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the market share of the
different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you for your attention and
bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Nael, for the invitation and
always happy to share a panel with my
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna talk about the French
regulation in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hearing Kai, it's difficult to
imagine that our countries are so close
[SPEAKER_03]: and yet so far away in terms of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the French regulation in cannabis in a
nutshell, therapeutic cannabis is still
[SPEAKER_03]: not legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're under a pilot program that was
supposed to last for two years,
[SPEAKER_03]: initially started in March, 2021,
was extended this year for another year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So legalization is now not expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until 2024, CBD and wellness hemp is legal
to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will come back to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And adult use cannabis, I will not be
talking about it simply because it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: even under discussion right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't see any legalization coming
soon in this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as medical cannabis is concerned,
France decided to go through a pilot
[SPEAKER_03]: program rather than legalizing directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in March, 2021, they started a pilot
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just before I go into little
details regarding the program,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as the legal framework is
concerned, the principle in French law is
[SPEAKER_03]: that cannabis is illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever activity related to it is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are three exceptions that are set up
by law.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first ones are cannabis based
medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So traditional medicines containing
cannabinoids that have gone through the
[SPEAKER_03]: four stages of clinical trial and have
obtained a marketing authorization like
[SPEAKER_03]: any other medicinal product from the
company and authorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one that was added recently to
go through the pilot and to match with the
[SPEAKER_03]: pilot program is medicine, like medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is like flowers and oils that are
used for medicinal purposes, but that have
[SPEAKER_03]: not obtained a marketing authorization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet they are compliant with a certain
number of criterias, including EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third exception is R&D.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can obtain licenses from the French
competent and health authorities to run R
[SPEAKER_03]: &D programs on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pilot program that started two years
ago was initially designed to enroll 3,000
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: One year in, we had only 1,500 patients
enrolled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to date, one fourth of them has
already left the program, either due to
[SPEAKER_03]: side effects or to lack of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we need to know is that medical
cannabis under this pilot program is the
[SPEAKER_03]: last recourse prescription product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's for patients that I've tried any
other available therapeutic solution on
[SPEAKER_03]: the market and that are for whom nothing
is working anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pilot program in cannabis is available
for five therapeutic indications.
[SPEAKER_03]: So neuropathic pain, serious
pharmacoresistance, epilepsy, supportive
[SPEAKER_03]: care in oncology, palliative care,
and central cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Central nervous system-related diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: France decided to go with finished
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlike Germany, we don't have magisterial
preparations with cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's used under three forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So dried flowers for vaporizations,
no smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall forms, like capsules, gels,
and oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you can see, the requirements for
the quality and safety of cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_03]: used under the program are pretty
stringent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, like GACP, UGMP,
the ANSM, which is the French health
[SPEAKER_03]: authority, requires the products to be of
pharmaceutical quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to comply with all the other
guidelines that are basically
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical guidelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plans also must meet the
specifications of the European monograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specific requirements also related to
France is that suppliers are all foreign
[SPEAKER_03]: companies since we don't have a local
production line in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those companies cannot distribute
directly the products to the centers and
[SPEAKER_03]: the health centers that are involved in
the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to enter into partnership
agreements with French pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that had already the
authorizations to deal with narcotic
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was pretty long to put in
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Kai said about agreements earlier,
those agreements are pretty long to put in
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if we are fast-forwarding to
legalizations, any operator that is
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to enter the French market in a
way or another and is seeking a
[SPEAKER_03]: partnership with a French company really
needs to start, if they haven't started
[SPEAKER_03]: yet, to seek for partners and discuss
those partnerships because it's not taking
[SPEAKER_03]: like one month to put in place,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's about the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much has happened, unfortunately,
in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but if we are talking about a
legalization in 2024, there are still a
[SPEAKER_03]: few questions that remain unanswered.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is the pricing and the
reimbursement of the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicinal products in France have their
price and reimbursements determined as per
[SPEAKER_03]: a certain number of criterias.
[SPEAKER_03]: But medical cannabis, and I'm not talking
about pharmaceutical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are like traditional medicines,
medical cannabis hasn't gone through the
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional clinical trial process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have those status like ASMR and
all those proof that are traditionally
[SPEAKER_03]: used by the pricing authorities in France
to set up the price and the reimbursement
[SPEAKER_03]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't know yet what the authorities
are going to do and how they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: determine the criterias for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The supply is another question because
even though since February 2022,
[SPEAKER_03]: the French law has incorporated the
possibility to cultivate medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: on the French territory, the
implementation texts are not published
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's in the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know it's there, but you cannot put it
in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is that no one is ready
yet to cultivate medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_03]: France.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes millions to build a facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need authorizations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we know that in case of
legalization in March 2024, there will not
[SPEAKER_03]: be a domestic production line in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the supply will rely on foreign
suppliers again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is definitely an opportunity
for foreign operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also time now, as I was saying
before, to start discussing how they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to supply, how they're going to win
their place on the French market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is now at the latest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last question we have,
which is a major one, is the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: patients that will benefit from medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as we know, before we started the
pilot program, everybody was talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: a tremendous number of patients that would
benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were really, really nervous about
the fact that 3,000 patients for the pilot
[SPEAKER_03]: program was not enough and that a lot of
people would be left on the side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: road.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reality one year in is that only half
of the patients that were planned to be
[SPEAKER_03]: enrolled in the program entered the
program and one fourth of them are already
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an unanswered question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see the difference, the patients
that benefit from this pilot program are
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the time people who never used
cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have all the people who use
cannabis in the illegal way and as a
[SPEAKER_03]: so-called recreational way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And among them, you have people who use it
for real recreational purposes and you
[SPEAKER_03]: have people who use it for medicinal
purposes, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because everything seems to be
mixed up at the moment, we don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: see and really know how many patients will
really benefit from what happens.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think the lack of participation was
because the scope is limited since just a
[SPEAKER_05]: few amenable conditions and that they were
able to back and include your
[SPEAKER_05]: participation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been used up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've increased the scope over the first
year, especially in oncology.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have opened and enlarged the criteria
for enrollment, especially in breast
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer and pediatric cancer, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they have, but it's also
complicated because the doctors that are
[SPEAKER_03]: involved were trained.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a few hours training and we
see doctors not complaining, but
[SPEAKER_03]: explaining the difficulties they have with
titrarization, for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say, okay, but we have to adapt
the product to each patient and it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: highly monitored.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it's a combination of
factors that makes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also one factor that appeared is that
a lot of people left the program because
[SPEAKER_03]: they can't drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's complicated to run your daily
life if you're using a product and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a lot of factors involved,
but for sure it doesn't help with
[SPEAKER_03]: navigating the numbers and knowing exactly
the real picture of it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole need for a program is being
at their height because what meant in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first is if this program is being
advertising, advertised by, you can't
drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main need will be the physical very
big, that adverse effect, reason that
[SPEAKER_02]: people is not going to come even drive
because of this stigma all around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that's the possible
solution here is number one, how they are
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising this program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, they don't create more stigma
if there is already existing stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number three, which patients are you
you're aiming in this program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same with the surrogate to the
positive areas of the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those patients will be very happy to
receive these treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is about how we are getting ready
for these programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you work only executing
programs for executing programs or really
[SPEAKER_02]: want to to attach a goal or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not it's not I wouldn't say
they use advertised.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I mean, there's a program
put in place, but the number of centers
[SPEAKER_03]: and health hospitals that are involved is
listed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not all the centers in France that
are involved in this program.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, so if you're a patient and
you're not in the geographical area and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not already followed up by a health
care professional that is involved himself
[SPEAKER_03]: in the in the pilot program, you don't
have access to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second point is, of course,
like any other medication, if you're using
[SPEAKER_03]: morphine, you're not going to drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like any other medication that
comes with a warning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you shouldn't be driving if you're
using something that alterates your
[SPEAKER_03]: consciousness or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on the ratios and the
dosages that are used, that's like any
[SPEAKER_03]: other drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the side effects like any other
medicinal products, the doctor has to
[SPEAKER_03]: inform you when you enter a program or
you're being prescribed a medication that
[SPEAKER_03]: there it may come with side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, the side effects and especially
with these medicinal products,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really active on a personal level
and each patient will actually have a
[SPEAKER_03]: different response to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the adaptation of the dosage is going
to vary from a patient to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some patients will not have side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some will have side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an ongoing curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: You constantly discover new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it's not so much about how
the program was advertised.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more, first of all, was it
available where you live, where the
[SPEAKER_03]: patients live?
[SPEAKER_03]: Has the patient already tried all the
drugs before and all the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_03]: solutions that were available?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it not working anymore for this
patient?
[SPEAKER_03]: So those criterias are strict for sure and
limiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we would need to see a little
further and in time to really gather all
[SPEAKER_03]: the different reasons why the number of
patients remains limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the second part is about CBD and
wellness hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go through too deeply
into that, but I'm going to refer to what
[SPEAKER_03]: happened in 2022 because we had a pretty
active year in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after the cannabis decision in 2020,
France was forced to refuel the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation, which was judged too
restrictive compared to European law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they came up with the arrêté of
December 30th, 2021, according to which
[SPEAKER_03]: the hemp plants that can be used legally
and cultivated must be listed either on
[SPEAKER_03]: the EU strains list or on the French list
of hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants must contain less than 0.3% of
THC The extracts and products containing
[SPEAKER_03]: the extracts must also contain less than
0.3% of THC, subject to specific rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on the kind of products
concerned and notably cosmetic products
[SPEAKER_03]: and food products for which there are like
a general safety rule, a principle
[SPEAKER_03]: applying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the regulation didn't come with any
further detail on what they were
[SPEAKER_03]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically I will mention a case later,
but we go with a 0.3% THC limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hemp flowers and leaves are authorized
only for industrial use, but the retail
[SPEAKER_03]: sale to consumer of raw hemp flowers and
leaves, whatever the form, which means
[SPEAKER_03]: including herbal tea, was prohibited by
this regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can imagine that the entire
industry jumped off their chair,
[SPEAKER_03]: went mad and was like, okay, we're going
to sue this regulation because first of
[SPEAKER_03]: all, this prohibition of the retail sale
of hemp flowers to consumer created a real
[SPEAKER_03]: problem regarding the principle of free
movement of goods in Europe because having
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp flowers illegal in the neighbor
countries, these could be imported into
[SPEAKER_03]: France while the same product manufacture
in France was illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second legal issue we had about and
I'll come back about this regulation and
[SPEAKER_03]: this prohibition was that basically it
means that the hemp flower, the hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: strain you're using and the plant is legal
as long as it's on the list, one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: list and it contains less than 0.3% of
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, the flowers and the
leaves from the same plant are considered
[SPEAKER_03]: as a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure why I'm still trying to
understand how they came up with this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but still that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this regulation on the field created
basically two main issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is the novel food
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So novel food is in the EU a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's EU wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in theory, you're not supposed to put
any CBD products, edible products on the
[SPEAKER_03]: market, including the French market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have as far as food supplements are
concerned, the French regulation is pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: very clear on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot use novel food that has not
been authorized by the FSA in the
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing or food supplements.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in practice, the reality is that
we've seen very limited controls on the
[SPEAKER_03]: French market over the past few years,
which has resulted in a tremendous number
[SPEAKER_03]: of products invading the French market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find CBD products and CBD oils
and CBD gummies and CBD chewing gum
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere in pharmacies, in CBD shops,
in supermarkets, and so if you're lucky,
[SPEAKER_03]: you will not be controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not lucky, you will get a
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on where you are,
it can be bad timing, bad location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it creates real discrepancy and
inequality on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we see and two consequences we've
seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first one is not directly related
to CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one is that a lot of companies
have started suing each other for
[SPEAKER_03]: competition and unfair competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And judges, because the French authorities
have not taken real clear position and
[SPEAKER_03]: official position regarding the
enforcement of the novel food regulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though they will say and they rewrite
somewhere you're not supposed to place
[SPEAKER_03]: until those products on the market until
the FSA has given the marketing
[SPEAKER_03]: authorization, yet you still have no real
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the courts, whenever you will have
a competitor suing another competitor for
[SPEAKER_03]: unfair competitions, claiming that said
competitor is selling his products in
[SPEAKER_03]: supermarkets while he's not doing it
because he wants to remain clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: The judge will simply decide most of the
time that he's not the one who has to make
[SPEAKER_03]: decision until the competent authorities
have taken a clear position on what to do
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding notably the transitional
measures that are contained in the novel
[SPEAKER_03]: food regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second issue is the hemp flower So
with the prohibition of the retail sale of
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp flowers to consumers, a lot of
industry players actually sued the
[SPEAKER_03]: government and to have the regulation
repealed or at least the article that was
[SPEAKER_03]: setting out the prohibition repealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in 2022, we had three major court
decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one was the constitutional
council in January 7th, 2022 that reminded
[SPEAKER_03]: the definition of narcotics and that
precise that by narcotic, we must
[SPEAKER_03]: understand psychotropic substances that
characterized by risk of addiction and
[SPEAKER_03]: harmful effects on health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was pretty important for the CBD
industry because it kind of confirmed what
[SPEAKER_03]: had already been set up by the ECG in
2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: In January 24th, 2022, the French Council
of State suspended the provision of the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation that prohibited the retail sale
of hemp flowers to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the retail sales resumed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in December 29th, 2022, the Council of
State ruled on the merits of the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And decided to repeal the article one,
paragraph two of the regulation and hence
[SPEAKER_03]: repealed the prohibition of retail sale of
raw hemp flowers and leaves to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's now the legalization is confirmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's next further following this
decision is that the government is
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to review the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they will come up with it's a
question because we know they're still
[SPEAKER_03]: reluctant and they don't want to have
smoking products on the French market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a big question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tea may be easier to solve because even
the European Commission has already
[SPEAKER_03]: indicated to France that tea is a food
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you cannot rule as a narcotic,
but the smoking product issue remains a
[SPEAKER_03]: real question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would expect more clarifications in
the regulation itself, notably regarding
[SPEAKER_03]: the safety, the THC levels in food
products and cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are not sure that the legislator is
going to come up with any clarification
[SPEAKER_03]: anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are questions that still remain
2023, maybe an interesting year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much Marie.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next speaker after is Robert Japp.
[SPEAKER_08]: All good?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to go Robert.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Robert Japp.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a regulatory lawyer based in London.
[SPEAKER_08]: I focus on advising medical cannabis and
CVD companies on all their sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: day-to-day regulatory compliance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's graduated interval regulatory
support for big corporate commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: transactions as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today I'm going to be talking about the
disaster zone that is medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_08]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to sound like I'm being very
negative about things.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is still huge, huge growth potential
in medical cannabis in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I genuinely believe in it,
but the next two to three years is going
[SPEAKER_08]: to be a decisive time, make or break for
this sector.
[SPEAKER_08]: So firstly, medical cannabis has been
legal in the UK for more than four years
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Patient numbers have increased slowly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, we think there was about 20,000
patients in the legal regime, which are
[SPEAKER_08]: receiving prescriptions and having them
fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an increase from 7,000 patients in
2021, which is positive, but we are still
[SPEAKER_08]: way short of the numbers that are needed
to make this a successful and sustainable
[SPEAKER_08]: industry in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So medical cannabis is paid for privately.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have the same position as in
Germany where medical insurance will pay
[SPEAKER_08]: for cannabis medications.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's been a handful, and I mean
literally a handful, four or five
[SPEAKER_08]: prescriptions are being paid for by the
NHS at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's obviously the end goal is to try
and get the NHS to start paying for more
[SPEAKER_08]: and more prescriptions, but we seem to be
quite far away from that at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the agenda for today.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll just do a brief history of how we
got medical cannabis legalized in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk about the five stages of the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go through some of the
issues, the challenges that the sector is
[SPEAKER_08]: facing, and that will include things like
being able to advertise medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: the restrictive prescribing situation,
and also cost and quality of products is a
[SPEAKER_08]: real issue as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm going to give you my ideas on
how we can solve things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them will probably be quite
controversial, but I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_08]: being talked about enough about how we
make an industry where businesses can
[SPEAKER_08]: actually be profitable and successful.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 2018, we had a stellar media campaign
whereby mothers with sick children,
[SPEAKER_08]: children who had epilepsy were going
across to the Netherlands, getting
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis medications for them,
bringing them back into the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as they entered the UK, the border
force would seize the medications from
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was on the front page of every
newspaper across the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: Public opinion swung very quickly behind
medical cannabis and the home office had
[SPEAKER_08]: to act.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did a six-week consultation and
then they legalized and it just caught
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone by surprise for the home office
to act that quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is unheard of in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have cannabis-based medications are
now in schedule two of the Misuse of Drugs
[SPEAKER_08]: Regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's accepted that finished product
cannabis medications have a medical
[SPEAKER_08]: purpose and a medical use.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been placed into the specials
medicine regime for unlicensed products.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a couple of licensed medications
in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're talking Epidiolex, Sativex,
the GW.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise it's all brought in under the
specials license regime where there is an
[SPEAKER_08]: unmet clinical need for certain
conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the current regime.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of the problems that I'm
going to identify today will basically
[SPEAKER_08]: boil down to the industry being hampered
by the regulatory regime.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the five stages of the
medical cannabis supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't like official five stages.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my made up five stages that I use
to get it right in my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is how I explain it to people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got stage one is the EUGMP
certified products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much all of the medical cannabis
being prescribed in the UK is coming from
[SPEAKER_08]: overseas.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not have a situation where cannabis
companies are growing medical cannabis for
[SPEAKER_08]: the medical market.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it will be coming from Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be coming from Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are starting to be some products
coming online.
[SPEAKER_08]: From places like Columbia and Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got to have a GMP certified
products to be able to issue it to
[SPEAKER_08]: patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stage two is import.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you need a license from the home office
to be able to receive the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: as it comes into the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stage three is logistics and storage.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you need another license from the
home office, which is a wholesale
[SPEAKER_08]: distribution authority.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually stage two and stage three go
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you will have a lot of companies in the
UK that hold these two licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will import the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll store it and then they'll
distribute it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll distribute it via pharmacies and
they will need a license from the MHRA to
[SPEAKER_08]: allow them to bring in these unlicensed
medications.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, you've got the
frontline.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got the clinics who are facing the
patients and you've got the doctors who
[SPEAKER_08]: are issuing the prescriptions and they
have to be specially trained doctors to
[SPEAKER_08]: issue prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the restrictions on
prescriptions is something I'll come onto.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what progress have we made since 2018?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the good news is, as I said,
there is an increase in patient numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are around 20 to 24 companies
running medical cannabis clinics in the UK
[SPEAKER_08]: at present.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can imagine, you can do the maths
yourself, 20,000 patients amongst 24
[SPEAKER_08]: clinics.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not a huge number of patients that
these clinics are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the more I'm hearing is that a lot of
the time they are just passing around
[SPEAKER_08]: patients between them, moving the same
number of patients around from clinic to
[SPEAKER_08]: clinic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are not seeing a big increase in
patient numbers for these clinics,
[SPEAKER_08]: which will help them have a sustainable
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: So really it's only consultant doctors
that can do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's about 30 or 40,000 doctors in the
UK that are able to prescribe medical
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: We probably maybe have about 100 to 150
who are actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a really big problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's very few doctors who are actually
actively out there prescribing medical
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, and that needs to change as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a huge problem with awareness
about medical cannabis in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: The majority of the population don't even
realize that medical cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you are trying to increase patient
numbers, that is very, very difficult if
[SPEAKER_08]: people actually don't even know that it
exists.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you go to the US and you go into a
hotel and you turn on a TV and every other
[SPEAKER_08]: advert is for a medication or a treatment
or a clinic or something like that,
[SPEAKER_08]: we don't have that in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a real big problem for medical
cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: They cannot advertise their services.
[SPEAKER_08]: They cannot advertise their products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's driving them crazy, to be honest,
not being able to tell people that they
[SPEAKER_08]: are there and the products are available
and that people can get access.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've then got the cost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Product cost is still relatively high.
[SPEAKER_08]: The medical cannabis patients in the UK
will probably be looking at paying around
[SPEAKER_08]: 200 to 250 pounds a month for their
medication to fulfill their prescription.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most people can't afford that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got patients who are receiving
opioid medication from the NHS for free
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're saying, stop using those
opioids and come and use medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: and you have to pay 200, 250 pounds a
month, a lot of them will say,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just stay with the free medication.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cost is increased by the
regulatory burden that is placed on the
[SPEAKER_08]: companies that are operating in the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Incredibly enough, when you're only
dealing with such a small number of
[SPEAKER_08]: patients, it's a surprise that we still
have such problems with quality product
[SPEAKER_08]: and reliability of products in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's one thing to get a patient into
the medical cannabis regime.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's even harder to keep them in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're having patients receiving
prescriptions and having to wait two or
[SPEAKER_08]: three months before they actually get
their product, the likelihood is they'll
[SPEAKER_08]: get tired of waiting.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll go back to the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they do get their product and it's a
poor quality, we've had problems with mold
[SPEAKER_08]: and seeds and all kinds of nonsense in the
products that are being issued to
[SPEAKER_08]: patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, they'll go back to their dealer.
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't hang around to wait for a
quality product to turn up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of issues that need to be
addressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that we really want in
the UK is for GPs to be able to prescribe
[SPEAKER_08]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in 2001, we had the medical cannabis
access bill was brought to parliament.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to go into parliamentary
procedure, but effectively a bill gets
[SPEAKER_08]: bounced back and forth between the House
and Commons and the House of Lords.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if it gets enacted, it becomes an
enacted piece of legislation.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a really sort of narrow proposed
legislation, really had two key points.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one was to allow GP to be able to
prescribe as well as the specialist
[SPEAKER_08]: doctors and the Tory party filibustered it
and it got talked out and it never went
[SPEAKER_08]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the expectation is that bill is
probably dead and nobody's going to try
[SPEAKER_08]: and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And initially I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, you know, it's such a small
change that we're asking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in fact, when you think about it,
if suddenly nationwide, all of the GPs in
[SPEAKER_08]: the UK could prescribe medical cannabis,
you would probably see patient numbers
[SPEAKER_08]: increase.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exponentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's probably what the
government was worried about too much too
[SPEAKER_08]: soon, too quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Hodges review was a report that was
done recently, which has called again for
[SPEAKER_08]: GPs to prescribe, but they've they've
suggested a nationwide trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is actually potentially a
really good idea, you know, pick a small
[SPEAKER_08]: area, get five or 10 GPs who are keen to
be involved and, you know, let them
[SPEAKER_08]: prescribe for six months, 12 months with
the oversight of a specialist or
[SPEAKER_08]: consultant and see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The difficulty with that is GPs are
already overwhelmed in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to say to them,
look, guys, come and do some training,
[SPEAKER_08]: come and, you know, give some time to this
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to explain to them
what's in it for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The good thing is we've now got countries
like Australia where GPs are prescribing
[SPEAKER_08]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if you can perhaps demonstrate
to GPs in the UK that by prescribing
[SPEAKER_08]: medical cannabis in place of some of the
other treatments that you are giving,
[SPEAKER_08]: whether it be opioids or whatever,
you may actually start to see your
[SPEAKER_08]: patients coming less and less because
they're able to manage their conditions
[SPEAKER_08]: more on their own with the medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be, in my view, the way you
could really encourage GPs to get involved
[SPEAKER_08]: and make that effort and put that time in
to to get involved in this in this
[SPEAKER_08]: prescribing regime.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still waiting to see whether the NHS
or the authorities would authorize a GP
[SPEAKER_08]: trial, but hopefully it will happen soon
because it's a really important part in
[SPEAKER_08]: moving things forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: So advertising medical cannabis is really,
really tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said, medical cannabis companies are
desperate to advertise.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, there was a recent,
well, in the last year, there's been a
[SPEAKER_08]: company in the UK called Dispenseroo,
which is basically a recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: company.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, it's a website.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy your weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy THC vapes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You pay in crypto.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets delivered to your house,
obviously completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had quite a lot of press
attention because they did some guerrilla
[SPEAKER_08]: advertising whereby they made up some tube
posters to go on the train and just slid
[SPEAKER_08]: it over the legit posters.
[SPEAKER_08]: It got picked up by all the mainstream
media.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy behind it is giving interviews to
national newspapers, obviously
[SPEAKER_08]: anonymously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought this guy is going to be in
jail very soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, nine to 12 months on,
it's still happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's getting picked up in the press
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just cannot believe that the police
haven't done anything about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're clearly quite smart, you know,
to cover their tracks and make it as hard
[SPEAKER_08]: as they can for the authorities to find
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the point of that story is that
medical cannabis companies would kill for
[SPEAKER_08]: that kind of exposure, you know,
to have articles being written about what
[SPEAKER_08]: they are doing in the independent,
in the Guardian, in the evening standard
[SPEAKER_08]: on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would love to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But our regulations are very, very strict.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, much like Silk Road, you know,
the online platform for illicit products
[SPEAKER_08]: on the dark web.
[SPEAKER_08]: They caught the Dread Pyre Roberts in the
end.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: So how long these guys at Dispenser Rube
can get away with it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the fact of the matter is that medical
cannabis companies are worried about
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses like Dispenser Rube.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are they going to be able to encourage
patients to get into the legal medical
[SPEAKER_08]: market if these recreational cannabis
companies are effectively setting up and
[SPEAKER_08]: are able to get away with it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I suspect the police are under pressure to
try and... You're totally right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can take you from there, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's OK, no worries.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's a real issue for medical
cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what happened recently, there was an
article in some of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: publications like Business Can,
like Cannabis Wealth, about an import of
[SPEAKER_08]: some medical cannabis by an Australian
company into the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it had come from, I think,
their cultivation site in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was the first import of medical
cannabis from Jamaica into the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Business Can and Cannabis Wealth,
they wrote these amazing articles saying,
[SPEAKER_08]: what a great company, what a great
product, what an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the CEO of another medical cannabis
company, who I won't name, emailed the
[SPEAKER_08]: Australian company, they emailed the
Jamaican company, they emailed Cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: Wealth, they emailed Business Can and
said, guys, this is promotional material.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't take this down by 4pm today,
I'm going to snitch on you to the
[SPEAKER_08]: Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory
Authority.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whilst this medical cannabis company is
desperate to advertise, they will
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely make sure that nobody else is
able to do it if they can't as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the current state of the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know about this because the Australian
company sent the article to me and said,
[SPEAKER_08]: Robert, what's our exposure here?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, yeah, this is promotional
material.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have gone beyond factual into the
promotional realm.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're starting to tell everyone it's an
amazing product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is where maybe now there is a
potential cross-border crossover between
[SPEAKER_08]: the CBD market and the medical cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm not talking about CBD today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the reality in the UK is that
CBD is about reaching its peak.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not too much growth left in that
market.
[SPEAKER_08]: What CBD companies do have is they've got
a huge database of CBD consumers that have
[SPEAKER_08]: been buying their products for the last
four, five, six years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have a CRM of 80,000 consumers
who maybe are paying between 100 and 200
[SPEAKER_08]: pounds a month for your products,
that would be a really, really useful
[SPEAKER_08]: platform to leverage to try and pull those
consumers into the legal market.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could access that 80,000,
you only need a conversion rate of about
[SPEAKER_08]: three, four, five percent, and you're
starting to generate serious, serious
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the things that I've been
thinking about is how can medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: companies team up with CBD companies now
to leverage that consumer base and try and
[SPEAKER_08]: pull more people into the market?
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it will happen or not,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it would be a really,
really good idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's a really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Patient power in the UK is substantial.
[SPEAKER_08]: The medical cannabis patients in the UK
have a very, very powerful voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a screenshot from a website
called MedBudWiki.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a website that is run by chap called
Ralph Leonardo McMurray, and he is a
[SPEAKER_08]: phenomenal resource.
[SPEAKER_08]: The amount of time and effort he puts into
putting this together is quite
[SPEAKER_08]: astonishing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what this website does is it lists all
of the available medical cannabis products
[SPEAKER_08]: currently on the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: It lists the price point.
[SPEAKER_08]: It lists where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has patient reviews.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is an incredibly powerful resource
amongst the patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's being used by the medical
cannabis companies to see which products
[SPEAKER_08]: the patients like, which products they are
coming back for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a bad review on MedBudWiki for your
product is a serious, serious deal now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most medical cannabis companies in the UK
will have a patient liaison officer who is
[SPEAKER_08]: dedicated to monitoring this resource and
making sure that their products are
[SPEAKER_08]: getting good reviews.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it means that these companies have to
work really, really hard to get rid of
[SPEAKER_08]: delays and poor quality products because,
as I said, getting a patient into the
[SPEAKER_08]: medical cannabis market is one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keeping them is even harder.
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said, the cost is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this goes into who are you
targeting to get into the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: market?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, obviously we'd love to have all of
the pain patients in there, but as I said
[SPEAKER_08]: before, if they're already receiving
medication and treatment for free from the
[SPEAKER_08]: NHS, it's going to be very hard to
persuade them to stop that and start
[SPEAKER_08]: paying 200, 250 pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: a month for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is where it perhaps starts to get
a bit controversial.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the UK for the last four or five
years, every time you go to see a talk or
[SPEAKER_08]: a panel event on medical cannabis,
it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put the patient first, put the patient
first, put the patient first, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Patient access and patient experience is
of vital importance.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we don't start to figure out a way
for these companies to actually make money
[SPEAKER_08]: and be profitable, I know a lot of
patients think that medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: companies are incredibly greedy and
they're making millions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise you it's quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we don't figure out a way to ease the
cost burden and the regulatory burden on
[SPEAKER_08]: medical cannabis companies, we're not
going to have a medical cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_08]: for patients to access.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you've got to put the patient first
and it is an important factor,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we've got to start talking about
profits as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is it that these companies are
actually going to be profitable,
[SPEAKER_08]: be successful, and still be here in three,
four, five years' time?
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said, you ignore the patient lobby at
your peril.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are well-voiced, they are
influential, and medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: companies are really taking notice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, look, if it's the regulatory
burden that is causing a lot of these
[SPEAKER_08]: problems, then you would look to the
government to try and help.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need some sort of intervention from the
government here to either ease the
[SPEAKER_08]: regulatory burden, to boost the industry
in some way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to an event with the CMC a few
months ago, and we were told the Centre
[SPEAKER_08]: for Medicinal Cannabis, a very influential
organisation in the UK, very closely
[SPEAKER_08]: linked to the Tory party.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were influential in getting medical
cannabis legalised in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were told that the government
doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their position was that in 2018,
we took action to legalise.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our job is done.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did what we had to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's up to you to run with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the government doesn't care,
then that's a really, really big problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to need governmental support
to actually make the UK a thriving medical
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't help, then it's not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, I think we'll have a change of
government in the relatively near future.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, at that same meeting when I
suggested, you know, we need a change of
[SPEAKER_08]: government, I was told, no, no,
no, no, no, nothing good will come from
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in my view, what could be worse than
they don't care?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it couldn't be any worse with a
change of government.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very hopeful we'll have a change of
government soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then hopefully, we may start to get
the support that we need to move the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry forward.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the United States after retail,
the biggest cost riders are provided that
[SPEAKER_05]: physician costs, labour and then federal
taxation and settled.
[SPEAKER_05]: From there, there's really nothing left,
no profitability here, not even for your
[SPEAKER_05]: rents or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of profitability in the UK,
what are the big cost riders that's
[SPEAKER_05]: preventing the profitability?
[SPEAKER_08]: So is the licensing obligations,
the actual cost and difficulty of getting
[SPEAKER_08]: the licenses and maintaining the licenses
is substantial.
[SPEAKER_08]: What companies want to do is they want to
bring in just, you know, big bags of dried
[SPEAKER_08]: flour and then package it up themselves
and distribute it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't do that unless in certain
conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the product is having to come in as a
finished product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, every step of the supply
chain, someone is taking their margin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So by the time you then get to the
doctors, you've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: the fee of paying the doctors,
running the clinic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I understand it, with a lot of
these medical cannabis clinics and they
[SPEAKER_08]: have physical clinics, their cash burn
rate is insane, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So until you can start getting the patient
numbers up, they are just losing money.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is where we come to the inflection
point in the next two or three years.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the government is not going to help,
what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my last slide now, I'm nearly
finished.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first of all, 2023 is going to be
survival, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Most medical cannabis companies were
playing the survival game last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably going to continue this year
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to see a lot of consolidation
in the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're already starting to see it in CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lovehemp filed for administration.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of sort of mergers as well have
fallen away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not be surprised if you see some of the
really big players in the medical,
[SPEAKER_08]: UK medical cannabis market disappear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Either disappear or be acquired or be
absorbed by a bigger player.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's definitely going to happen this
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the last thing I'm going to say is my
first experience of legal cannabis was in
[SPEAKER_08]: California in 2012.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was walking down Venice beach and
there was all of these touts on the beach
[SPEAKER_08]: saying, you know, come in and see our
doctor, pay your $40 and you'll get your
[SPEAKER_08]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was amazing because they had this
sign of medical conditions and you had
[SPEAKER_08]: really serious stuff at the top,
cancer, multiple sclerosis, that sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then down at the bottom, you had
stress and, you know, sleep and that sort
[SPEAKER_08]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you go in and they say, oh,
do you ever get stressed at work?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you say, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do get stressed at work.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's your prescription, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, I was there with a
girlfriend at the time and one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: touts shouted after us, you know,
couples that blaze together stays
[SPEAKER_08]: together, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reality of that, in California in
2012, you had a rec market masquerading as
[SPEAKER_08]: a medical market, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, this is where I'll get
lots of stick for saying this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what needs to happen in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to stop thinking about just
patients and you had to start thinking
[SPEAKER_08]: about consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: One less person buying from the illicit
market is one more person buying from the
[SPEAKER_08]: legal market, whether they are a patient,
whether they are a consumer, whatever it
[SPEAKER_08]: may be.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to my mind, that is the only way we are
going to start generating the patients
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers that we really need.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully, we'll then end up like
places like California moving to a full
[SPEAKER_08]: adult use market.
[SPEAKER_08]: The risk, of course, is if the media get
hold of, you know, evidence that we have a
[SPEAKER_08]: rec market masquerading as medical,
then that could be really problematic in
[SPEAKER_08]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, we've got to get
patient numbers up and that means taking
[SPEAKER_08]: some fairly radical and innovative
approaches to putting more people into the
[SPEAKER_08]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to hand you over to our final
speaker of the legal panel today,
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel Heyman from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of activity in this room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi,
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Daniel Heyman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a corporate and life science lawyer
from Zurich.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was previously a commodities trader,
so I'm not sure on Woody Allen's stairway
[SPEAKER_01]: to hell whether I moved up or down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I leave that to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we don't have too much time
left, so I'm going to do that relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: quick and dirty without presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The framework that is embraced in
Switzerland for legal cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole market is the Narcotics Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Switzerland, cannabis with a THC
content up to one percent is considered is
[SPEAKER_01]: not considered a narcotic drug and
everything above is a narcotic drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the law, it says Delta nine THC and
it's isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here already the first question THC
eight and any other compounds that have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same sum formula and molecular weight
as THC nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta nine is considered a narcotic drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on that framework, we basically
have three different classifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is cannabis with a THC
content below one percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everything that goes above one
percent is either the medical market or
[SPEAKER_01]: the non medical adult use market or slash
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's speak first about the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland is relatively big on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis flower is probably one of the
biggest producers in Europe of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and also one of the biggest
exporters of cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way CBD is regulated really
depends on how you as a producer classify
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring the product to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis flower is a smokable mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a smokable, it's tobacco substitute
law that applies in Switzerland freely
[SPEAKER_01]: marketable, which makes it relatively
special in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now other markets are joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Czech Republic and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this market is still depending on on
where the flower is sold in growth or in
[SPEAKER_01]: retraction mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's cyclical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have other products like e
cigarettes and vaporizers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: considered as classified as a utility
article for human contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, it is also absolutely freely
marketable in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the cosmetic products,
all the cosmetic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you a lot about the cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite a ride because cannabis
oils, for example, either with CBD isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: or full spectrum have been marketed in
Switzerland as chemicals first,
[SPEAKER_01]: then or even as foodstuffs first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once all this advertisement,
the government realized that doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: because of novel food regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also applies in Switzerland, by the way,
as in the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: They moved to chemicals and then they
moved to cosmetic products, which is an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously the authorities don't like
this change in classifications because the
[SPEAKER_01]: product themselves didn't really change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our arguments was always that as long as
the products are safe and comply with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulations, they should be in the
market and there should be a value valid
[SPEAKER_01]: way to be able to market these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for the CBD market in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's speak about the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis with a THC content of one
percent and above in Switzerland was an
[SPEAKER_01]: exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a way to market for these
products, but only with a special permit
[SPEAKER_01]: from the health ministry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that changed last October,
where the market really opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis with a THC content of one
percent and up for medical purposes became
[SPEAKER_01]: a controlled substance, no longer
prohibited narcotic with limited
[SPEAKER_01]: marketability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these products today, they can go to
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big difference is that doctors can
prescribe them freely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They no longer have to run to the health
ministry and ask for a special permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the patient doesn't have to be
half dead and have tried everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: before he can get access to medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we have quite a big problem in
the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a licensing system that was
introduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all now transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a way to market for producers,
but it's quite complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, it's already been
mentioned, so I'm not going to repeat most
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a problem of awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors don't have enough education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest issue is reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis is not per se reimbursed
by the health insurance in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have to show and you have to
prepare a whole dossier and hand it in in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's companies who start and help with
this process, also helping the doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: with administrative burdens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to go back to what Robert just
said earlier, agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to show medical companies how to
make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the big, big issues is that we
don't have the buy ins from the from the
[SPEAKER_01]: health care professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really have to find a way to
educate doctors and to facilitate their
[SPEAKER_01]: life in order to understand how they can
easily prescribe medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have a benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we have another challenge that for a
lot of GPs, general practitioners in
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland, one of the big income streams
is self-dispensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we have like a magisterial
preparation framework in Switzerland where
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to have a two tiered consultation
first by the GP and then also by the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy, you cannot self-dispense
cannabis in the Swiss when you go to a GP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also the financial incentive there is a
bit lower for the GPs, but it's not all
[SPEAKER_01]: GPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we believe that there is various ways
to solve this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's definitely one of the things
that that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last, we also have a data collection
obligation for doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to collect data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sanctioned if they don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see how what's going to happen
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would like to comply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely a little bit of a
burden for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might also be one of the reasons
that many people or many doctors say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I don't know, I'm not going to pay
for this additional time, additional
[SPEAKER_01]: burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's speak about the lastly about the
recreational markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in Switzerland, these products are
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's been a change in the
Narcotics Act that allows for pilot
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually the first legal dispensation
in pharmacies for the first pilot trial
[SPEAKER_01]: just happened last month in Basel,
which is a great precedent, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these these products come in various
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, the first products are
cannabis flowers that are packaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trial trials are always in the context
of a scientific trial, scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have public and private
organizations that can apply at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal Office of Public Health,
the health ministry to conduct such a
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually you need someone to finance the
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have a research institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have the buy in from a
municipality because you can do it in one
[SPEAKER_01]: or a few municipalities, but not federal
on the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you have all these buy ins and
you have prepared your project,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it is approved, you can go to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to market either via pharmacy,
social clubs or coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even have edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the product regulatory constraints
that you have for novel food and so on
[SPEAKER_01]: don't apply in this scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have up to 5000 people in such
a trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The term is limited to five years,
possible to extend another two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually dispense up to 10
grams per consumer per month of pure THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: which translates to depending where you
are, the maximum THC content is 20% in the
[SPEAKER_01]: product or 10 milligrams per serving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It translates to basically maybe 50,
60 grams of flower, which is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for one product.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's happening in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, there's also in parallel
to these to these trials, there's also a
[SPEAKER_01]: development parliamentary initiative that
was handed in a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already passed through the National and
State Council.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the National Council has the mandate
to prepare draft legislation for full
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization of cannabis for non medical
use in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite involved in the process with the
industry association that I represent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quite fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite a challenge to find the right
framework on how public policy
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations can be aligned with the
goal of getting rid of the black market
[SPEAKER_01]: and also satisfy the consumer perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to put all these under one
hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that by the end of the year,
this year or beginning of next year,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have the first draft for
legalization of cannabis in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see where it goes from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically for me, I think was
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another Q&A, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, now it's to open us to the floor
for any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see we're dealing with Germany,
the largest beverage stage in the European
[SPEAKER_04]: Union, and that's movement towards
regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: France, which traditionally has a very
strong domestic market for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and yet seems to be stuck in the soles.
[SPEAKER_04]: The UK, well, formerly in the EU,
now outside the EU, having made some
[SPEAKER_04]: progress towards regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: For medical use, and then effectively the
market evaporating, as I see it,
[SPEAKER_04]: before the eyes of those who tried to get
into the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Switzerland kind of coming up
with a very interesting pilot scheme,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is, of course, going to be fodder
for other jurisdictions who may be
[SPEAKER_04]: considering to go down that road.
[SPEAKER_04]: First question I'm going to direct,
unless there are any questions from the
[SPEAKER_04]: floor, is this case that is coming before
the federal courts in Germany on the
[SPEAKER_04]: constitutionality of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps, Kai, you might just a little
elaborate a little bit on that for our
[SPEAKER_04]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really take it seriously right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's coming probably all at the
same time in March.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what are the general thrusts of what
they are going to argue in that case?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you any kind of insight?
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if we were taking a
constitution or challenge of an issue
[SPEAKER_04]: before a Supreme Court, we'd have certain
grounds for making the argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: Human rights, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on a basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Article 2 and Article 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Article 2 is the free personality,
and Article 3 is the comparison to alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: and the different treatment of these two
substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of the hierarchy of law,
obviously, between German constitutional
[SPEAKER_04]: law, the international convention on human
rights, and then the single narcotics
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs convention, in terms of the trust of
the argument, are they saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, the rights of the individual take
precedence over some international
[SPEAKER_04]: convention?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the gist of the argument they're
making?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first and foremost, it's the new
scientific findings that cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_00]: damaging, it helps, and is not a gateway
drug, and all these old arguments which we
[SPEAKER_00]: have overcome, so a mix of lots of
aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that seems to be an expansion of the
argument, because under international law,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, we talk about controlled drugs,
but cannabis is limited for medical and
[SPEAKER_04]: scientific use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really using, this is the
argument saying that at the time of the
[SPEAKER_04]: framing of the convention in 1961 and the
subsequent psychotropic conventions in
[SPEAKER_04]: 1972, the understanding of medical and
scientific was limited, but in the current
[SPEAKER_04]: state of our research knowledge that it
should be expanded upon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the gist of where they're going
with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Daniel, I'm very curious about the
Swiss pilot model.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, somebody said to me recently,
from Switzerland, they said, no
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdiction as of yet has managed to get
regulation of cannabis whether it's the 21
[SPEAKER_04]: states in the United States or some of the
jurisdictions like Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were very confident that the
Swiss model could be the route to go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just kind of curious of your
perception.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long is this particular pilot scheme
set to run?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand it, correct me if I'm
wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Bern was the first or Basel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Basel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Basel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long is it supposed to run for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposed to run by law between five and
seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five is the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a possibility to extend
by another two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I mentioned earlier, yes,
and that's going to be the interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: question is we have a parallel development
happening on the legislative side,
[SPEAKER_01]: where again, we are and the government is
really and the National Council is really
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to put a bit momentum into drafting
the first legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that goes through parliament,
we have a semi-direct democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a possibility that it will end
up on the ballot again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see how that develops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that doesn't happen, the fastest
roads to legalization could be within two
[SPEAKER_01]: years already, two, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be also four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's my estimate is that the latest
in five years, we have a legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: market in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be, of course, dependent on
neighboring jurisdictions as well as part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would probably be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I think Switzerland is a
bit of a special kid in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: not being part of the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could imagine that Switzerland might
actually go its own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, to some extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marie, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one that probably some of our
Irish delegates here will have questions
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, it's the free movement
under Article 34 of the Treaty for the
[SPEAKER_04]: furthering of the European Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, where this comes down to is
that our classic case of cannabis back in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2019, 20, 20, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the major problems that we've had
in this jurisdiction?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that happened just before Christmas
was an appeal case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you haven't had an
opportunity to look at this in which a
[SPEAKER_04]: judge in the Irish High Court was
presented with a judicial review
[SPEAKER_04]: application and the judicial review
application was in relation to the seizure
[SPEAKER_04]: of CBD products that were imported from
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: The upshot, of course, this application
was that they wanted a declaration that
[SPEAKER_04]: the seizures were wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, they were seeking a
declaration that the Minister for Health
[SPEAKER_04]: should, of course, define what the
appropriate limits for CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this all comes down to the classic.
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.2 as it was 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Irish court took a very,
very conservative take on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, a literal understanding of
Article 7 of the Single Narcotics Strokes
[SPEAKER_04]: Convention by saying that any presence of
THC in a product that might come across,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the frontiers from other EU
member states falls within the context of
[SPEAKER_04]: Article 36 as the state's right to
prohibit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, my understanding of this is the Irish
courts have actually got it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps maybe just for some of the
delegates here, you might explain a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more about that cannabis decision and
the wider context of free movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I haven't put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, well, so that the cannabis case was
really about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I take the French regulation,
the former one before the cannabis case,
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulation was limiting the legality
of CBD products to products that were made
[SPEAKER_03]: from extraction of the hemp seeds and
fibers only, which meant that basically
[SPEAKER_03]: any extract that was made from the hemp
plant in its entirety was considered
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem in the cannabis case was that
the litigious product was e-cigarette and
[SPEAKER_03]: vaping product that was imported from
Czech Republic, where it was made legally
[SPEAKER_03]: from the entire hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the French authorities considered that
it was a narcotic because the extract was
[SPEAKER_03]: made from the hemp plant in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it ended up in front of the ECG and the
ECG considered that a member state's
[SPEAKER_03]: domestic law that is too restrictive
compared to EU law, unless the state
[SPEAKER_03]: actually demonstrate and proves that the
restriction and the additional restriction
[SPEAKER_03]: is due to health, public health issues and
threat or threats to public order,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't have a more restrictive rule or
law in a member state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where the cannabis case really,
really changed things in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we ended up with those new
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also had further domestic
regulations because the cannabis case was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually about extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody made it about like flowers and
raw flowers, but it was really about
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then had a few months later a case
where the decision in France from the
[SPEAKER_03]: administrative Supreme Court judging that
it would apply also to raw flowers that
[SPEAKER_03]: would be imported from another EU member
state where it was legally produced and
[SPEAKER_03]: then you could not prevent their sales in
France on the basis of the free movement
[SPEAKER_03]: of goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm quite surprised actually to see the
Irish decision because it goes against the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire principle free movement of goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in particular, since now the THC level
for industrial hemp in Europe is 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: France was actually ahead when they
published the regulation in late 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: By using the 0.3, they anticipated the
agricultural EU regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they put 0.3% before all the other
EU members states.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so saying that any trace of THC in
products, even though legally produced in
[SPEAKER_03]: another EU member state is considered as a
narcotic, then we, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a real problem with this decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is definitely an arguable
case.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm obviously very obliged to discuss the
Bagoosa's case too much because I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: sure whether that is under appeal to the
Court of Appeal, but I can certainly see
[SPEAKER_04]: some reference points to the European
Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is some approach was made
and I can only say this from just general
[SPEAKER_04]: awareness to the European Commission to
ask whether this decision was in line with
[SPEAKER_04]: the current perception of things at
Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand nothing was forthcoming
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact is, as I see it, the Irish
court seems to ignore that principle that
[SPEAKER_04]: the least restrictive rule within another
member state should be the rule to follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be interesting to pose this
question to Robert to a certain extent
[SPEAKER_04]: because they are applying the Misuse of
Drugs Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 is the
greatest knockoff in terms of legislation
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's basically the UK equivalent
from 1971 as transpose into Irish law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's largely based on the UK law,
albeit they're taking a very strict view.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be kind of curious as to the
perception of the UK courts in relation to
[SPEAKER_04]: the presence of any component of THC in
any product such as a CBD product,
[SPEAKER_04]: what the UK courts would view at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Misuse of Drugs Act is more than 50
years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not fit for purpose.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any distinction between
high THC flour and low THC flour because
[SPEAKER_08]: in 1971, we didn't really know about these
things to a wide extent.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Misuse of Drugs Act disproportionately
impacts upon communities of color and
[SPEAKER_08]: poorer communities.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for a good long period, everyone,
the middle classes in England have been
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely fine with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it needs radical reform and overhaul.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't see it happening anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue therefore then is the Misuse of
Drugs Act implements the UK's obligations
[SPEAKER_08]: under the UN Narcotics Convention into
domestic law.
[SPEAKER_08]: And decisions like Cannavape have made it
very, very clear, in my view, that
[SPEAKER_08]: domestic legislation should not be used to
prohibit products which don't have any
[SPEAKER_08]: narcotic properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the issue with things like hemp
flour, CBD flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are consuming it, but the THC
content is so low that nobody's getting
[SPEAKER_08]: high from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not considered to be a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's much the same with CBD products
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the THC content is low enough
that people aren't actually getting high
[SPEAKER_08]: from these products.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why is the Misuse of Drugs Act being
used to prosecute people selling CBD flour
[SPEAKER_08]: in the UK?
[SPEAKER_04]: The bizarre thing, I just don't have to,
the journalist, the Irish court,
[SPEAKER_04]: taking such a ridiculous view of 0.2%,
which is of course, which is 0.3% of that
[SPEAKER_04]: is in the plant, that they're,
you know, kind of complaining that this
[SPEAKER_04]: would be an attack on public health.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you read the judge's decision,
it's, you know, anyone with any knowledge
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis would say that is like,
I suppose we used to have a product called
[SPEAKER_04]: Club Shandy, as most Irish people would be
aware of, which is lemonade, and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's almost 0%, 1% alcohol in it,
you know, that nobody could possibly get
[SPEAKER_04]: pissed on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the equivalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, Daniel was about to- I just
wanted to add one thing on the CBD oils,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, it's really about the ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have a CBD oil with 0.2% THC
and 0.1% CBD, it shoots you to the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Switzerland also now, when we're
discussing an entire framework,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're thinking about how do we deal with
these products?
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, how do we deal with
all these HHCs and other cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: That can also really be regarded as THC
equivalents, but they're not specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned in law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so the public health argument that
you mentioned, Niall, that, to my mind,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Maria will agree with
this, but that flies in the face of the
[SPEAKER_08]: verdict in Canavape.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the European Court of Justice
was quite clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should not be using domestic narcotics
legislation to prohibit non-narcotic
[SPEAKER_08]: products on the basis of public health,
because there's no evidence to show that
[SPEAKER_08]: there is an issue for public health.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the situation in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: The UK authorities are deathly afraid of
THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Home Office has asked the Advisory
Council on the Use of Drugs to carry out a
[SPEAKER_08]: consultation on what should be the illegal
limit of THC in a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we all know that the result is going
to be so low that you're going to end up
[SPEAKER_08]: in a situation where you only have
isolate-based CBD products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these products don't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: People want full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the elephant of the room about
these isolate products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could say a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for regulatory lawyers, it's great,
because it means there's going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: endless legal challenges.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as the Home Office adopts its new
position on THC, that's going to get
[SPEAKER_08]: judicially reviewed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the limit will be so low,
it won't have any evidential basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be a policy decision rather than a
decision.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be a decision based on actual
evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the public health issue and the public
order, because in France we had both,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's exactly what the Council of State
ruled in December, last December.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually said that the French
government hadn't proved in any way
[SPEAKER_03]: whatsoever any threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the public health threat or the public
order threat that they were claiming to
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibit the retail sale of hemp flowers
to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the government's argument all
along, saying yes, but for the law
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement, for instance, you cannot
distinguish raw hemp flowers from cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers with high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: When everybody proved to them,
because this is what any other member
[SPEAKER_03]: state does, that there are tests and
specific tests that are very easy to use,
[SPEAKER_03]: that don't cost too much money,
that you can put in the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on the color that comes out,
it's either cannabis, THC cannabis or
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the French government really lost this
case in this aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another aspect and issue we have is with
the 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that it's not precise,
depending on the products we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about, 0.3%, we saw fairly recently little
geniuses that decided to convert 0.3% into
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw gummies appearing on the market
with five milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they came up and say,
hey, hubo, five milligrams of THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's far below 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if it's still on the market,
it's not going to stay long because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely- And that doesn't fall down of
the reference dosage.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an issue that we see often raised
by the likes of the HPRA about the amount
[SPEAKER_04]: of tolerance in the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very curious how they get around
that in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't see, but we saw that popping out
and people claiming about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were like, yeah, well, you know,
that's the exact issue we see with the
[SPEAKER_03]: lack of clarity in the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, you have to define exactly
what you want, what is legal, what is not
[SPEAKER_03]: legal, what you mean by the THC level,
the CBD levels, and any other cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: level in this type of products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because without those precisions,
you will always end up with people trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to circumvent and going through and using
the weaknesses of the regulation to place
[SPEAKER_03]: products on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about consumer
protection, we need to have clarity in the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation and not legislators that are
dragging their feet because they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to move on with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at some point, we need to take the
responsibilities and to work to have
[SPEAKER_03]: clarifications where they're needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I wonder instructions that were 10
minutes, 15 minutes in for two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I may have time for one more question.
Anyone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob, sorry, bring it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been said that the CPP regulation in
the UK is a model for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you didn't comment much on it,
but could you just describe why people
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about it that way and what are some
of those basic features?
[SPEAKER_08]: So novel food regulation is effectively
the benchmark globally for food standards
[SPEAKER_08]: and quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is akin to a pharmaceutical procedure.
[SPEAKER_08]: The amount of data and the studies that
need to be prepared in relation to the
[SPEAKER_08]: products is extensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're effectively talking about full
toxicology studies to show the impact of
[SPEAKER_08]: taking the product for every day for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can imagine there's a huge amount
of laboratory work that goes into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the expectation is once you have a
novel food compliant product, you should
[SPEAKER_08]: be able to introduce it into any market in
the world because you will have the
[SPEAKER_08]: safest, most highest quality products that
there is.
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that because of the nature
of the data and the information that needs
[SPEAKER_08]: to be generated, it is an expensive and
lengthy process.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's effectively using a sledgehammer to
crack a walnut.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the regulatory burden that has been
placed on UK CBD companies to achieve
[SPEAKER_08]: novel food compliance has in fact stifled
the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has stopped innovation.
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot bring new products to market.
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot bring new formulations to
market until you have achieved full
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing authorization.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the expectation is that could take
anything between two and six years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whilst the introduction of novel foods
for the CBD sector was supposed to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: platform for the industry to really take
off and hit the mainstream, instead,
[SPEAKER_08]: it has caused a number of operators to
drop out of the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has placed a significant regulatory
and financial burden on the existing
[SPEAKER_08]: operators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, sales have not
increased at the rate that is needed to
[SPEAKER_08]: sustain the financial success of these
companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why there is a general feeling
that novel foods has had the opposite
[SPEAKER_08]: effect of what it was intended to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also reflects on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're doing in the UK is they're
shoving these industries into existing
[SPEAKER_08]: regulatory regimes that don't suit
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So putting medical cannabis into the
specials licensing regime doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, amongst the UK
government, there doesn't seem to be any
[SPEAKER_08]: inclination to create bespoke regulatory
environments for cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is ultimately what is needed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I've been running around a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that concludes this morning's panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to thank our speakers,
Kai, Marie, Robert and Daniel,
[SPEAKER_04]: for their excellent contributions this
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could give them a round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
