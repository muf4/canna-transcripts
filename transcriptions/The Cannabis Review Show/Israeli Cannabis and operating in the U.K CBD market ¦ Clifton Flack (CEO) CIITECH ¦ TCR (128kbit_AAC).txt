[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of The Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined today by
Clifton Fack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the co-founder of SciTech Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping day Clifton,
you well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for being on the show
and helping share a little bit of wisdom
[SPEAKER_00]: for the audience that are watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to maybe, if you want to start,
well, maybe I think the first topic is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to basically bring the start of your
career, the industry into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us the start guidance on how
you got into cannabis and your relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: Israeli cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, thank you for having me
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good things moving forward in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my background, I'm from, born and
brought up in England.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually moved to Israel about 15 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: My professional background is marketing,
marketing and entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found myself involved in cannabis about
six years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a medical cannabis was kind of
beginning to to explode in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw back then was I think
we'll talk about it soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things we saw back then was
a big delta, a big lack of entrepreneurs,
[SPEAKER_01]: not enough companies, not enough young
people with innovative ideas or business
[SPEAKER_01]: plans or technologies to drive the
industry forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still back then, there was very much
it was a taboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entrepreneurs that we would meet many
times hadn't told their family and friends
[SPEAKER_01]: what they were doing because there was
still this stigma around around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we began by launching
an event called Cannatech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of Cannatech was to bring
together entrepreneurs and investors and
[SPEAKER_01]: try and create discussion around the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my first couple of years was really
based around that kind of building
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems and raising awareness and some
government lobbying to try and move
[SPEAKER_01]: everything forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then about four years ago, I came to a
painful conclusion that the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis side of things or the THC or the
doctor prescribed cannabis, which however
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to call it, is fraught with so
many obstacles, so many problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they can and are being overcome in
the short term, it's consumers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: missing out, whether it be regulatory or
entrepreneurs or product availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I moved from the THC side of things to
the CBD side, because in 2016,
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK began to recognize, or the MHRA
recognized that CBD has medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, the awareness and the
education of what CBD is and what it can
[SPEAKER_01]: do just began to blossom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I set the business up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Citech was formed four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is to bring medical cannabis
quality products to the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We launched Provacan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Provacan is our flagship brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We launched that four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now one of the market leaders in the
UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no cannabis leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no green coloring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's something the doctor
would prescribe or your pharmacist would
[SPEAKER_01]: dispense.
[SPEAKER_01]: In short, it's something that as a
consumer, that when you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: product, feel it and use it, that it
immediately elicits trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to work in trusting the
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit about how I came to
where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And could you give a little bit of a
background on your products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: developed in Israel with the leading
scientists that they've got over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain to the audience how long
Israel have been in the research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development part of the cannabis industry
and why they're considered the world
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders at this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we've been in the research
and science side since day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Professor Rafael Michelam,
who's often referred to as the grandfather
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis medicine, it was him in the
late 1950s that began to research
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he and his team throughout the 60s
discovered an isolated THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they coined the phrase entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a whole plethora of other cannabinoids
were discovered by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they began to research and really
uncover the medicinal benefits of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because up until that point, all we knew
about the plant was it gets you high and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that was built the
propaganda of everything we've known in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 40, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is in the 60s that we began
to kind of break through those molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really until about the late
1990s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So California was already beginning to
move towards medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd reached a point where we were not
just researching from the scientific side,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we kind of moved that investigatory
intuition into the medical, into the
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical study world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the late 1990s, we were already
beginning to research and understand and
[SPEAKER_01]: uncover what it can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from epilepsy to autism,
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of indications that
wouldn't have been known about had it not
[SPEAKER_01]: been for hospitals and patients over here
in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've continued that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have this amazing perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's more clinical studies here for
cannabis that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this country than all of the world
combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hundreds of studies going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from pre-clinicals in little
petri dishes through to full on human
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, double blind placebos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every hospital in the country has
some kind of cannabis clinical study going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the point that even in the last two
or three years, the stigma of cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: all but disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: The final stretch will be when we actually
legalize in government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope that's going to happen in the
next year or two or 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly it's very rare now that you
would find anyone that would speak out
[SPEAKER_01]: against cannabis because almost everybody
knows someone who's benefited from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're in a good position over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that leads me perfectly onto the
next topic, which I hope we're both going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start to see more of, which is
encouraging more startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see being the hinder block
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the actual fact that it's still
illegal and a lot of people frown upon it
[SPEAKER_00]: and the floodgates of entrepreneurs
creating startups will happen once there's
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of full open legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is some innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some entrepreneurs going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been for a number of years,
but certainly it's the regulatory,
[SPEAKER_01]: the doors that are closed because THC is
psychoactive and in almost every country,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, from everything from just
gaining a license to research the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: let alone use data or any kind of
innovative technology where you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: touch the plant to develop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've all thought, we all hoped that
just the medical cannabis regulations that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been rolling out would open up the
market enough to allow entrepreneurs in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that's mostly down to until
the banks, until the financial
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions can involve themselves in the
industry, then everything gets blocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entrepreneurs need investors and
investors, while investors investment is
[SPEAKER_01]: growing significantly, it still lags way
behind other industries at this stage in
[SPEAKER_01]: their growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: By now, we should be looking at,
you know, there should be VC funds and
[SPEAKER_01]: family offices and all manner of
investment coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the UK, I mean, even I think this week,
there's two companies that are listing on
[SPEAKER_01]: the stock market in the UK this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fantastic news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three years behind where it should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're hoping now that, you know,
now that's happening, the floodgates will
[SPEAKER_01]: open and over the next year, there will be
a lot more investment coming in,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to encourage startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing more disparaging,
and I know this myself, nothing more
[SPEAKER_01]: disparaging for an entrepreneur than
knowing that there's nowhere to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: money from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banks aren't getting loans because it's
still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, yes, this is what we need to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A free market is required to develop the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the exciting products come from
creative minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to push this through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree totally with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of the headlines of the
sale of GW Pharma there recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a good thing for the industry or a
bad thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, it can only be a good thing
any time that cannabis is normalised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use this word a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sooner we can normalise cannabis,
the sooner that all normal things will
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, including entrepreneurs and good
products and good regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I think it's happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree with you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of leads me on to the last thing I
wanted to talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a man who knows how to build a
brand between the stuff you've got with
[SPEAKER_00]: James Haskell and the various other
products that you've got out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the three tips that you'd give to
somebody who's starting in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry on how to build their brand up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you one tip because I think it
all starts with one thing, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you then dismantle and deconstruct
the word trust?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to say my background is
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a science or a medical
professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I come at the industry from that
marketing and brand building side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know from my years in the industry
and other industries in brand building,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got one target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your bullseye, the target every single
time is to build trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you've got consumers who are
choosing between different brands,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, what's the one thing that makes
them decide one over the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one they trust is going to work
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they trust is going to be more that
the branding, the brand language is
[SPEAKER_01]: affiliated to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They trust that when they tell other
people about it, that they're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a good reception.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trust, trust, trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in the CBD or cannabis industry
is not an easy task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about their
fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mentally, health care products,
something that people are using either in
[SPEAKER_01]: replacement of regular medicines or
alongside regular medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not something that's for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to build trust in something that people
are using for their health is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did, I guess this is my single
biggest takeaway, is we identified where
[SPEAKER_01]: the trust is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right or wrong, the trust is in medical
cannabis over CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, if you look at the markets in
America, and actually over here in Israel,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a perception in the marketplace,
and again, it's wrong, but it's how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved, that if you want efficacy from
cannabis, then you need medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CBD doesn't do a good enough job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we know that's not right because
arguably it's the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is the anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is the anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD does so many good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC does some good things, but from a
therapeutic perspective, it really is the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is we asked ourselves,
how do we bring the credibility of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis into a CBD product, into a
wellness product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, medical cannabis,
you'll see it's being sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: A specific strain is good for autism,
or a strain is good for cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very close indication of
specific strains, which without the
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical studies, it's not a legal
position to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly in the CBD world,
we do not make claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell it as a food supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we cannot say that our CBD is good for
PTSD or that this one is good for pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we can say is our CBD is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to build that trust is quite complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did is from day one, alongside the
development of the product, that we do
[SPEAKER_01]: over here in Israel, we began investing in
and working with a lot of universities and
[SPEAKER_01]: hospitals on the clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we funded a number of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've involved ourselves in cannabis
studies to look at potential to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: asthma, the potential to treat fatty liver
disease, diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We partnered with the Medical Cannabis
Nurses Association in Israel to share
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge because we've got tens of
thousands of customers who feed back what
[SPEAKER_01]: they use, what they use it for,
how they use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can't use that for marketing
because that'll be a claim, but we can
[SPEAKER_01]: feed that back to the nurses that we work
with and they feed us information or we
[SPEAKER_01]: can kind of work with our customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at our company,
SciTech, the background is we're
[SPEAKER_01]: positioned as a biotech or an R&D company
that just happens to produce good quality
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to what we see in the
marketplace, which is companies that begin
[SPEAKER_01]: as a CBD brand with not much behind them,
and then move on to try and establish
[SPEAKER_01]: trust and establish credibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take it that that's first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, you can have an ugly
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a very ugly logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do all those things wrong,
but as long as the essence behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: brand is strong, then in the healthcare
world, that's going to work because people
[SPEAKER_01]: will forgive a bad tasting product.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will forgive a badly packaged
product if it works, if they can sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: if their pain is gone, if their anxiety is
gone, they'll forgive all these things as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as they trust it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We build trust based on involving
ourselves in the science and the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a very interesting side of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great little note to finish
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust out there, everybody for acceptable
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fundamental pillar that you
need to put in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, as you were speaking,
I could think of a ton of CBD companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are literally now trying to pivot
into make every pharmaceutical thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: become lab testers and all this kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, yeah, as I said, if you get all
those pillars in the place, in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: place at the first time is where the aim
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clifton, thank you very much for coming on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you all the best for this year and
hope we get you on again maybe after this
[SPEAKER_00]: novel food license deadline to get your
thoughts on that over in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
