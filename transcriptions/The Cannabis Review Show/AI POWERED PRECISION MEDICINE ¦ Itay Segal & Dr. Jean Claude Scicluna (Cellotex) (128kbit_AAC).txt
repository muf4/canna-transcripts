[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined by Etey Segal
and Jean-Claude Chacluna from Cellotex.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys keeping?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all good and thanks for having
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you both on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the hot companies in Europe
at the moment, so I thought everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to find out what it is that you
guys are exactly doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we first inform you about the most
start with Etey and go to what's your area
[SPEAKER_00]: of expertise in this industry and how did
you come to set up Cellotex and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same with Jean-Claude after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm coming from technology background,
product, AI and actually following a
[SPEAKER_02]: personal story from my father getting to
understand a bit more on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually got me curious why no one
knows why doctors refer to entourage
[SPEAKER_02]: effect or personal life.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one actually knows the dosage or what
you should take or when.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the patient and going
through trial and error without a real
[SPEAKER_02]: compass.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where actually we have thought on
Cellotex, having more data come into play,
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding more on what's going on with
the patient, what's the actual intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal is eventually to create a
closed-loop medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: By closed-loop medication, you can
actually have it much more precise and
[SPEAKER_02]: optimized and customized towards the
patient symptoms, not as a generic one
[SPEAKER_02]: fits all as I would say conventional
medicine is doing, but something which is
[SPEAKER_02]: more personalized than medical cannabis
actually is the great treasure which is
[SPEAKER_02]: out there waiting to be unlocked and this
is actually what we have started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you very much and Jean-Claude,
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really and truly, it's something which
also changes the experience for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: and when we talk about the patient
experience, often patients in traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: medical settings have issues accessing
their data, have issues owning their data
[SPEAKER_01]: and most importantly, have issues sharing
this data with the professionals they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to share, be it doctors and with medical
data, it's always hard to get the balance
[SPEAKER_01]: just right, to get the balance between
what patients can interact with and
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately the data and insights that
doctors need in order to make good
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosis, to reduce errors in diagnosis
and in prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, what we're building here is a
sweet middle ground where this can be
[SPEAKER_01]: shared and where this can lead to better
insights, better data, better diagnosis
[SPEAKER_01]: and ultimately better care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the first topic
now, which is AI-powered precision and
[SPEAKER_00]: Atay, we'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the technology behind the
AI that you guys are building,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it large language models?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it computer science to throw to large
chunks of data?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the exact technology that makes it
special to be able to give this precision
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a perfect question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The short answer is a bit of all of the
above.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're starting off is obviously
assessing the patient symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The assessment of the patient symptoms is
not always easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're discussing about pain and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need a lot of biomarkers and this
is where we collect as much biomarkers as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, both passively and actively from
patients who are using the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best example for that would be
connecting to my wearable.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wearable actually knows how am I
sleeping, it knows my heart rate variance,
[SPEAKER_02]: different biofeedbacks which are relevant
to understand what's actually going on
[SPEAKER_02]: with that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously capturing the medicine intake,
alongside with that, you're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what actually happened to the
symptoms during the following hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the passive assessment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Active assessment can be visual or audio,
or anything that can be captured from that
[SPEAKER_02]: patient in order to, again, assess the
symptom and assess the outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really put on the engineering hat,
it's an input-output problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to do that, yes, as you said,
you need as much data as possible on that
[SPEAKER_02]: specific patient in order to better
understand its symptoms, potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: forecast them, and of course suggest to
the doctor what would be the right course
[SPEAKER_02]: of treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Referring to the language model,
which is an interesting one, what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually incorporating these days on the
next version of Sabotex is a language
[SPEAKER_02]: model, which is essentially your digital
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have understood from the first
patients, it can be cumbersome because you
[SPEAKER_02]: always need to collect also the patient
feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that it's being done today is,
okay, a scale one to 10, how is your pain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But with language models, you can actually
gain a lot more information from that
[SPEAKER_02]: patient in doing it in a much more
convenient way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a much more convenient manner,
which is natural to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be by text or by audio to actually
tell your doctor what's going on instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of running through a questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the language model incorporated and
empowered with the symptoms and the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines, you actually have almost full
circle of what you can learn about that
[SPEAKER_02]: patient, obviously taking into account his
EHR and background information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bottom line here, as you mentioned,
this is an AI model and what we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually empowering that with as much
data as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be the opportunity,
as you said, that the current standard is
[SPEAKER_00]: one to 10 on a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is your pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being given patients the opportunity to be
able to talk directly to whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: custom built applications with a
smartphone or an at home device and be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to actually have a full conversation
and get more nuanced information per
[SPEAKER_00]: patient would be where some of the holy
grail to be able to build these targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to refer to one of the points that
you have mentioned, our solution is at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment hardware less.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that we're tapping into
existing wearable mobile devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is for that to be within reach of
any patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way to go about it is on the
software side.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're seeing is that a lot of the
research at the moment is very limited in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the number of participants and
also very geographically focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what cellotex and part of our goal is
actually for that data to serve mankind
[SPEAKER_02]: and not specific companies or products.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we're agnostic to the
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're here for is actually to set the
compass for doctors and patients to have
[SPEAKER_02]: their personalized compass instead of,
OK, medical cannabis, go ahead and write.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, moving to yourself, Jean-Claude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next topic I wanted to bring up was
data and insights for doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big things we see across the
industry is the lack of data for doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to A, prescribe the medicine
and B, then prescribe it confidently based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the nuanced metrics of each individual
patients that's going to walk through,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a high tolerance to
cannabinoids or whatever this variable may
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is gathering this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: And providing this insights for doctors
around the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, starting off, medicine, evidence
based medicine, which we practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: is increasingly becoming data driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not simply in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply looking at other disciplines like
radiology and oncology, we can appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: that as time goes by, the doctor's tool of
choice will be looking at the computer
[SPEAKER_01]: screen rather than using a stethoscope,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely with plant medicine and
cannabinoids having such a complex way of
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting with each other, the need for
evidence based medicine and the need for
[SPEAKER_01]: data driven insights is bigger than ever
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So increasingly, it's very difficult for
doctors to be able to understand what the
[SPEAKER_01]: medication is doing in their patients'
bodies, because first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not with their patients once they
go home and your patient is medicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the term we sometimes refer to as
self-medicating when someone meditates
[SPEAKER_01]: without the supervision of a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But truly, even when you're being
supervised and coming from the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view of my experience in prescription,
sometimes patients come back and you
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that there are communication
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand there are nuances of both
taking the cannabinoid medication or the
[SPEAKER_01]: time taken or certain other activities
around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you understand that really cannabinoid
medication is not a simple prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a journey with the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to have a degree of hand
holding and a lot of time with the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this creates in modern clinics with
the understaffing even in medicine we've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen since the COVID pandemic,
it has created a really huge bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the need to be able to convert all that
data, all these insights about not simply
[SPEAKER_01]: THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have more and more doctors being
sometimes specialized in minor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and a lot of work we're
seeing with minor cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: research data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something we think will release that
bottleneck will be the ability of a
[SPEAKER_01]: solution to crunch the numbers and give
the insights for the doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the doctor's point of view,
just like we work with radiology,
[SPEAKER_01]: we look at the data and then do actionable
decisions based on that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will give not just cannabinoid
medicine but all plant medicine a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant boost, a boost in the
credibility because we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and cannabinoid medicine and
the credibility and the stigma is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely still present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, and most importantly really,
is a boost in the accuracy and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question for you both now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Sean, Claude, you go first with
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be that the massive
opportunity coming in the next let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: five to eight years is going to be from
the blends and formulations that are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to be created, whether it be from
fermentation engineering or whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted individual cannabinoids because
the delivery mechanism is similar across
[SPEAKER_00]: the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use this technology to be able to
consume the models that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be able to build up this
patient data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those unique formulations that target,
whether it's oncology, as you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: or chronic pain or cardiovascular
inflammation or one of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the next big massive step that
we're going to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to medical cannabis is
these unique formulations that end up
[SPEAKER_00]: being delivered for this exact nuanced
disease mechanisms based on their body
[SPEAKER_00]: weight per size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, let's look at what has kept
this technology from being present with us
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, it's the presence of big data,
big data pools, which are precise,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are accurate, and which can be
reliable markers for such products to be
[SPEAKER_01]: made, whether it is with precision growing
products or whether it is grown in a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: or all technologies around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a reliable marker of how humans
interact with these different strains is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we have not had so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's difficult to tell the future,
but definitely data-backed solutions will
[SPEAKER_01]: be a treasure trove for not just patients
and doctors, but other areas of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, which can grow exponentially
thanks to the data acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antoine, do you see the use of AI to be
able to run these tests for these
[SPEAKER_00]: potential molecule combinations being
another landmark when it comes to marrying
[SPEAKER_00]: these formulations to a degree?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely a big hype at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of companies are going about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the applicability of that,
because there is no one formula which
[SPEAKER_02]: would fit everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think conventional medicine has taught
us that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at clinical trials and obviously
real-world data, the efficacy is not
[SPEAKER_02]: always the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are different people, different gender,
different medical condition, and even
[SPEAKER_02]: different from one day to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability for those medicines to adapt
to the patient and not the patient adapted
[SPEAKER_02]: to the medicine, I guess this would be the
big change here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what precision medicine actually
brings in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot more molecules to work with and
the ability to understand what works for
[SPEAKER_02]: whom, when, how much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the next leap the way I see
it in healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fascinating to chat to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the thing you're looking forward to
seeing with Cellatex over the next 12 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any points on the horizon that
you'd like to let everybody know about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these still company secrets for now?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually not a secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have launched our activity in Germany
already working with compounding pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually doing exactly as we have
mentioned the compounding specifically for
[SPEAKER_02]: those patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going about observational studies
starting from Germany, but will be
[SPEAKER_02]: expanded soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely looking forward to see
where in the years time where we will be,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the industry will be but the way I
see it, it's much more on the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect of cannabis, not necessarily adult
use, which again I can fully appreciate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but more patients actively using it as
their medicine to relieve the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be Europe is definitely
going to be focused on the medical side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry for the number of years to
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean-Claude, anything you're looking
forward to seeing in the doctor side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think definitely having better data to
treat patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better is something I look forward to
being able to give a boost in the accuracy
[SPEAKER_01]: and credibility of the increasing number
of doctors getting into cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: facing stigma sometimes from colleagues
and sort of being pressured about data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think being able to give that to a
growing community of really great
[SPEAKER_01]: clinicians is for me one of the highlights
that I'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are working with doctors but
researchers and really want to make this a
[SPEAKER_01]: tool to push the entire cannabis
community, medical community and the
[SPEAKER_01]: creation of community forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely one to keep your eye on for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody wants to know more about Cell
Attacks, the website is below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be available in all descriptions for
you watch or listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, Nite, Jean-Claude,
thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for inviting us.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
