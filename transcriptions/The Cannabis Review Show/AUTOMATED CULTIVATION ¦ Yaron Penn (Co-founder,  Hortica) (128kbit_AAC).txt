[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the next episode of The
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Joran Penn, who's a co-founder at
[SPEAKER_01]: Hortica, their precision horticultural
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping today, Joran?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have some incredible technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you maybe want to give everybody a
little overview of how you ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: founding Hortica and what the purpose of
the company is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, I'm coming from an academic
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my PhD and postdoc in neuroscience.
[SPEAKER_02]: During my PhD, I was part of my research
was around addiction, drug addiction in
[SPEAKER_02]: general, more specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this drove me actually back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was already more than 15, 17 years ago
to the medical cannabis, which was just
[SPEAKER_02]: started back then in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after having a few ventures in the
medical cannabis field, I decided to focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on the raw material itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what drove me to establish
Hortica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to jump straight in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we explain what a gas model is,
a GAS model?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a grow as a service model and how
can everybody understand it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hortica is a technological company in the
field of controlled environment
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our focuses is around the cannabis,
but this is our field is also focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: local food security.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about grow as a service,
grow as a service means that we tailor the
[SPEAKER_02]: project for a specific client,
for specific geography, for specific
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the end user he doesn't need to
be an expert in that grow field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we are going back to cannabis,
we know at least in the US, it's more
[SPEAKER_02]: common when people talk about all those
grow experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here with our system, there is no
need for the end expert in term of is it
[SPEAKER_02]: in general, the whole system is being
managed remotely and it's operating more
[SPEAKER_02]: like a server farm than a real farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody who hasn't seen something
like this, it basically allows an
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur who might not have extensive
cultivation experience to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to be able to develop a
flower product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need the expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can bring in your software, your
hardware, the Internet of Things
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities and the precise management of
each individual strain and nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on whatever location and target
audience you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely right to describe it very
nice, Oren.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the customer can think of the system
as a 3D printer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, getting the right genetics and
pushing the right bottom for protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's run actually also hands off.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are training technicians in the end of
support of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we take also the responsibility on the
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is done remotely, as you
mentioned, through the IoT, which sits in
[SPEAKER_02]: the heart of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This very unique control card that we
developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's not specific only for
cannabis, but it's now today is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced control card in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this gives us the ability actually
from one control center to control those
[SPEAKER_02]: growth doesn't matter where they are in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now sitting with you and controlling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Israel located now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm controlling our facility in Tulsa,
Oklahoma in real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would imagine that it's a very
advantageous product for people who might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have a host of other things like
electricity or water or nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's precision managed,
then the waste and the overhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually where the advantage of
the system comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, when we compare to competitors today
or what exists today on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes to our basic pattern of
environment within environment and growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in those closed loop modules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of dealing with a huge volume
of a warehouse building where the plans
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves only take very little space out
of this huge space needs to be dealt with
[SPEAKER_02]: article because we broke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are only dealing with one tenth to one
fifteenth of this volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: This brings a very big reduction in the
cost of electricity needed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the biggest indoor growers
familiar expenses in the end is
[SPEAKER_02]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the efficiency and the second is the
efficiency of the growth that we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go to a very short cycles in the way
that we also we don't grow big plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we grow in a method similar to a sea
of green, many short plants per square
[SPEAKER_02]: meter per box.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it growing the top of the muffin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are only growing the central flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also how we get the
standardization between that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to already in Oklahoma to a 60 days
cycle, including drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the second and the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to say the most, but the
system is the only system in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: that the drying is part of the process of
the same process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being done before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the system finishes seven weeks of grow
and switches to a drying mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the drying is being done before
harvest, when they are still standing,
[SPEAKER_02]: maximizing both terpene levels,
but also visually, we are not losing a
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes in this more sensitive part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also the most sensitive part
in terms of risk management in catching
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how it is being done a box by box only
after drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a huge advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also the need for having
drying rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a time scale, what is the time
scale from first initially planting seed
[SPEAKER_01]: to cultivation to drying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the quantities that one
component can hold?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are talking about in the system,
we are starting with propagation room,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in the end it will be actually on
those, we call it the ink.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ink will come from one central
propagation facility in order not to have
[SPEAKER_02]: it in any facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will come as cassettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And introducing this cassette,
which is a rooted clone in the size and
[SPEAKER_02]: shape, it's eight weeks, including for
most strains, eight weeks, 60 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: including drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with at least half a kilo,
500 gram per box, per cycle of two months,
[SPEAKER_02]: including the drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We achieved something that not many indoor
growers achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful result is Sativa strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take a little bit longer,
but when we talk in our system a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit longer, it's a week longer,
but they give higher yields actually than
[SPEAKER_02]: the indica strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are achieving above in the US where
the focus is on THC, high THC as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are achieving above 25, 27%,
about 28 total cannabinoids with 2%
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a play with lower THC,
lower cannabinoid strains and then we get
[SPEAKER_02]: to a higher terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in one of them, we reached almost 5%
THC, cannabinoids, terpenes, my apology,
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is incredible technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to move on to know your position
on the editorial board at the Journal of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Research by the Nature Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about this
organization and what the work that is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the journal is an academic peer review
journal, part of Nature Group by Springer
[SPEAKER_02]: Publishing that publish research from
botanical research up to clinical related
[SPEAKER_02]: to cannabis, cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each year I'm doing something like three,
four reviews for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the paper for publishing again ranging
from genetics, from plant genetics and up
[SPEAKER_02]: to pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually I had the honor to be invited
where I'm the only one, which is only
[SPEAKER_02]: board advisory editorial board member,
which is affiliated to the industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: not from the academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Together with me there are all the,
including was Professor Meshulam,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not with us anymore, but
Professor El Suhir from Mississippi and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the rest of the most prominent
researcher in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a big honor to contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, another publication everybody should
be checking out and going to search.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a partnership with the
German Institute of AI and Robotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on
what that partnership outlines and the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits for both parties?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, Hotika is first controlled
environment, agriculture, technological
[SPEAKER_02]: company with the German Institute of
Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,
[SPEAKER_02]: the DFKI.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Institute is part of Bremen
University, sits under Bremen University.
[SPEAKER_02]: The head of the Institute, Professor Frank
Kirchner also sit on our advisory board of
[SPEAKER_02]: the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Institute is actually focusing mainly
on extreme environments, space and the
[SPEAKER_02]: deep water.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their core.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with them, we are looking on A,
we took an IP for a robot, for an imaging
[SPEAKER_02]: robot that we are now working on
introducing to the system to replace the
[SPEAKER_02]: robot that we are currently using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second is with them, they actually
just order system for their
[SPEAKER_02]: multifunctional role.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be a platform for developing
technologies when we look for the future
[SPEAKER_02]: at space agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The technology you guys have, it really is
very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you research, I've talked to over
250 people on this podcast, and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most exciting bits of tech that
I've come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've no doubt that the Hortika name is
going to be around for a long time to
[SPEAKER_01]: come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who doesn't know more or wants to
know more about Hortika, you can visit the
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link is below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be wherever you view or listen to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the is the German market,
the exciting thing for you guys this year
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what the rules look like in April?
[SPEAKER_02]: So most definitely the new development in
the German recreational market and more
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, the model that is going to
be implied of great interest and potential
[SPEAKER_02]: for technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on the club model that is going to
be adapted, it means that A, most of all
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation should be done in Germany in
contrast to medical cannabis program,
[SPEAKER_02]: which can be imported also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, each club, in a club we talk about
five up to 500 members each can purchase
[SPEAKER_02]: up to 50 grams per month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it puts the consumption of a club at
maximum 25 kg and they need to each club
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to grow for himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is with our system, those modular
system takes the burden of them and enable
[SPEAKER_02]: also brands, although a different
location, but the system enabled to have
[SPEAKER_02]: the same quality, the same results and
with very low risk and our ability also to
[SPEAKER_02]: offer in a very confined space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a small goal facility that
supply 25 kg per month to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: supply more than 10 strains
simultaneously, working in these small
[SPEAKER_02]: batches and still being conscious and
constant and safe and above organic most
[SPEAKER_02]: importantly, not most importantly,
but it's important to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it's been fantastic talking to
you, Yaron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be definitely keeping my eye on your
technology over the coming months and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wish you nothing but success.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is most appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real pleasure, Aaron,
you mentioned it was actually for me the
[SPEAKER_02]: most pleasure interview I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my pleasure as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
