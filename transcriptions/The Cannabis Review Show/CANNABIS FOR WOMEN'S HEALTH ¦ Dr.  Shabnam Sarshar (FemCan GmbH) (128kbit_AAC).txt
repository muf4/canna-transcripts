[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Dr. Shabnam Sarshar, who's a PhD in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry
from the University of Munster in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping today, Sarshar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm actually today is very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just about to go on my
vacation, so it's a perfect time to
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about about cannabis and women
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy lady,
so can you maybe give everybody a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: little overview of your position in the
industry and your experience to date?
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, I started in cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the research cannabis industry for
ADHD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was basically my starting point about
like getting to know how cannabis can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And upon that, I moved to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to work in a sanity group as a
medical advisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, we founded a new company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name is Femcan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Femcan be focusing on,
let's say, cannabis, cannabis contain
[SPEAKER_01]: functional cosmetics and like hopefully
near future functional nutrition for
[SPEAKER_01]: female health.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we start on the first topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is I know there's a lot of female
listeners and a lot of powerful women in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis for women's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody an overview
of how cannabis is applicable to women's
[SPEAKER_00]: health and what the potential benefits
are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, I mean, I think any living
organism with endocannabinoid system can
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually be like cannabis can be
potentially beneficial for that organism
[SPEAKER_01]: with endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for female health is especially
beneficial because endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: is ubiquitous in female reproductive
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at many anecdotal and I
have to open up parenthesis here,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, unfortunately, there is
very less good quality clinical study out
[SPEAKER_01]: there to analyze and examine the effect of
cannabis on female health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what we know is that basically on
old text from traditional herbal medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: from different part of the globe and the
anecdotes and surveys and observational
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having said that, there are a lot of
like good observational studies and good
[SPEAKER_01]: surveys that shows cannabis can help
different different symptoms of women
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say menstruation, pain and
cramps, endometriosis, which is a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: topic when it's come to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it is smooth as the transition from
premenopause, like the whole menopausal
[SPEAKER_01]: transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also very much help with orgasm and
sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, cannabis can not completely
close, but can, how do you call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like tighten the gap in orgasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see that from desire to labor,
cannabis can be helpful for female health.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are we talking about targeting the
endocannabinoid system with different
[SPEAKER_00]: blends and formulations that become
products, or is it a specific edibles or
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the optimum absorption method for a
consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, unfortunately, at the moment,
especially like in Germany, we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: that much of a diversity when it comes to
different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we have extracts and we have the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look from the female
physiological perspective, what can be
[SPEAKER_01]: super helpful are vaginal suppositories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that there is like one company in
Germany, Viamet, who put that effort to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring that to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a pre, let's say,
pre-made kits that pharmacies can make the
[SPEAKER_01]: life of pharmacists easier to bring that
kind of applications form into the
[SPEAKER_01]: customers and into the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, there is not a huge
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we have to look and we have
to see what kind of cannabinoid ratios,
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of formulation would be
beneficial for which purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you might need, you might
need an edible beside you might need a
[SPEAKER_01]: topical application, or you might need a
vaginal application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really depends which kind of
symptoms you want to target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, are you searching for short term
effect, long term effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, there are many, there's many
variants that you have to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_01]: when you develop a drug for female health
and female needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why there is a huge potential
out there to design and develop products
[SPEAKER_01]: specified for female needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, from one, so it's like that
it's two sides of the cone is that from
[SPEAKER_01]: one side, I'm like sad to see for just a
banal example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I prefer to to take eatables and I
prefer to take vaginal suppositories
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of like inhalation or instead of
like smoking that that's that's matches
[SPEAKER_01]: much better to my knees and my physiology,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there is no product that I can
access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad that it's not, but also it's
interesting for us as the people who as
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are like, let's say,
are working in this industry to see this
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a huge and nice space for us to
to move into and to develop products for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be that these
formulations and the specific use case of
[SPEAKER_00]: these formulations are the big advantage
and the big exciting opportunity that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming over the next five to ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of huge opportunity, can we talk
a little bit about the Fem Can story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give everybody a little
overview of why you set this company up,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the main objectives are and any
timelines that consumers might need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we started Fem Can for
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, so first I shortly say something
about Fem Can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fem Can is Fem and Can as cannabis and
Can as yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the title for Fem Can is that the
home of herbal feminists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Femmedies is female remedies,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I come with a background of traditional
herbal medicine and the way that herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine is some kind of, I don't want to
say suppressed or ignored, but herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine always comes as secondary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when you look at cannabis in
medicine, when you get your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribed, you have to show the doctors
that the doctor has to show to the
[SPEAKER_01]: insurances that all the other ways of
treatments are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like they try the second,
the first and the second, let's say a
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cannabis can be prescribed,
which I think herbal medicine can be
[SPEAKER_01]: super, super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why they should come at second or
third, maybe they should come parallel
[SPEAKER_01]: with the first line treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second part of it is that we want to
focus on female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, when you look at the look
at the people who support cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, women are less likely to support
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women are less likely to try cannabis if
cannabis get legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that come from global surveys
like the one that I'm giving you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just published by a Canadian
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot remember the name, but it's just
just published.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's twenty twenty three publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And women also have more negative attitude
to consumption of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for me as a scientist,
as a person who know how cannabis can be
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial for different female health,
like, let's say issues and generally for
[SPEAKER_01]: like the well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be just medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also be adult use and
recreational just for general well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a person who know that and have
experience with that, that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, because that's negative attitude
mostly come from social cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: backgrounds like this typical good girl,
bad girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a girl smoke cannabis or do cannabis or
any kind of drugs for that matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more, let's say, acceptable and
common for men.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of how do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of cultural, let's say push
backs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that we as a woman in
cannabis industry should try to overcome
[SPEAKER_01]: by talking about that, by just bring put
more light on this subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, if you use cannabis consciously and
cautiously, could be more beneficial as
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not we should also go to some
kind of like exhibitions and trade shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also see that maybe like five to 10
percent maximum of the participants are
[SPEAKER_01]: women.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest are men.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially like in Germany and talking
about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it's like changing little
by little.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need more voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more voice to talk about how the
benefits and how do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that stigmatized because still there
is a stigma around this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that stigmatized view out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically harm reduction way of
communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why as femme, we can be solely
want to focus on female health.
[SPEAKER_01]: The herbs that how do you call it,
affect our endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, not only cannabis affect
our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another example is kava kava.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing, amazing plants has also more.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Affinity, let's say a stronger affinity
even to CB1 receptor than like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these all of that said,
we want to bring endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: put light on endocannabinoid system and
work with the plants that affect this
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system and also
de-stigmatize the cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big hurdles you mentioned
there is the R&D, the actual scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: papers aren't completed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see Germany opening up now with a
larger scope and remit to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: these scientific trials hopefully over the
next coming 12 to 24 months?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I think 12 to 24 months is a
little bit like optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I'm a little bit
disappointed with all of these delays and
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a huge bureaucratic monster
around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely, you know that we need now
the government announced two pillar
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: One pillar is that self and communal
communication with some kind of a social
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second pillar is that to very
limited pilot project to some shops that
[SPEAKER_01]: they control the whole supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: These stocks are good, are super positive
because again, it helps a lot to take away
[SPEAKER_01]: a stigma from this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: From cannabis and hopefully now
universities come much more on board to do
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also companies should put more effect and
put more resources on R&D and clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: studies than just trying to bring another
new kind of flower, which is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diversity in the product is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also need some kind of,
we need like solid clinical studies and
[SPEAKER_01]: observational studies to be able to
develop good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is, I mean, I hope, I hope,
because a couple of years ago when I asked
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my university professors,
say, do you want to start some project
[SPEAKER_01]: with like CBD and ADHD?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just CBD, not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reply was, oh, no, no,
no, do you want to ruin my reputation?
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I see that the research in this
direction also in universities get more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, all and all is going in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish for a faster move than it's like a
slow, slow move.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entrepreneurial mindset wants
everything to move fastly, fastly so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can realize your ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic talking to you,
Shabnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who's not following Shabnam on
LinkedIn, I highly recommend you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: connect them with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who want to know more about
FemCam, the website is below and it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: in all the descriptions wherever you watch
and listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shabnam, you go off and enjoy your
holidays now and hopefully we get to touch
[SPEAKER_00]: base again next year and we can get an
update on where all the progress is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great day and thanks everybody
for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
