[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next episode of
the Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be joined on this episode
by Boris Moshkovitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boris is the co-founder and the managing
director of Alasfana, a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesaler, importer and exporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been providing the supply of
individual cannabis therapies for patients
[SPEAKER_00]: since 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boris, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_00]: All good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to have you on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, who's a cornerstone of the European
industry at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to maybe get you on and give
everybody an overview of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to maybe give everybody a
quick little review of how you ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: co-founding and managing director of
Alasfana?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it's been a ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we started in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: We founded Alasfana as a pharmaceutical
wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself, I've been in this industry since
2016 as, let's say, an activist,
[SPEAKER_01]: a voice in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, it wasn't even an industry,
but it was a group of people fighting for
[SPEAKER_01]: the right to have medical cannabis as a
therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: By 2017, the law came about in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the moment when it was legal to
prescribe it and receive it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, my first company for
cultivation didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tender was thrown out in court,
so I started this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alasfana has been in the industry since
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 2020, we're selling pharmaceutical
cannabis to pharmacies supplying patients
[SPEAKER_01]: all over Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 22,000 pharmacies in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: More and more pharmacies are getting the
hang of it, are understanding that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: legit and viable medicine that is being
provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems to be Germany is going to
be the cornerstone of the European
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and what happens there should
have good ripple effects across the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start straight away with the
first topic, which is the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pretty straightforward question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the most pioneering in the
pharmaceutical cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it North America or is it Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do take impulses from all over the
world in Germany, but the advantage of
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany is that now that we've started,
we're looking at Canada, at North America,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're also looking at Israel where
pharmaceutical cannabis is basically all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place in every pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that we have a lot of
innovation here in the sense of providing
[SPEAKER_01]: to patients and then just the system
because we have the first system that's
[SPEAKER_01]: reimbursing medicinal cannabis for
patients, so they apply and they get it no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter where they stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a research point of view,
I believe that there's a lot to be learned
[SPEAKER_01]: in the modes of delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that we see more in
Israel than we see in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: North America is especially looking at the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a lot flower-driven,
maybe extracts, but the future is more in
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations, finished products,
medical devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to do and a lot to be
learned and gathered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in that regard, Germany can be the
melting pot of all influences from around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned blends and formulations
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the key things that we think
is going to be the future of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical side of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings me on to the next topic I wanted
to talk about, which is the thought of
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys supply dronabinol, which is a
synthetic THC product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see biosynthesis becoming a
cornerstone of the pharmaceutical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry or is it still a number of years
away from being perfected?
[SPEAKER_01]: From where we stand, we've been talking to
partners who are investing in that sector
[SPEAKER_01]: of the industry and they're investing in
clinical studies because in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is about creating formulations,
isolating, more synthesizing those
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations that we can match with
indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do that, we need the clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an investor traditionally in the
pharma industry where you can protect your
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, this has been the difficulty
in the cannabis industry because there was
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing to be protected but brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that in the medical space,
we will see more of that coming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next two or three years, definitely more
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to happen as well as in the
States, as well as in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be providing that to patients by
securing marketing authorizations,
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing products, but we're not doing
the research ourselves or development,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're on that end of the market access
and distribution marketing provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosynthesis seems to give the producer of
the end product much more protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's on the process that they
create, the substrate that they use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the potential for medical trials
coming from an already
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical-grade company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think somewhere in between what we see
is the organic formulation, so what we
[SPEAKER_01]: call extracts, which we see now as oils
and eventually vapourable oils and
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the go-between step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biosynthesis will just be more of a
scalable process, and thus we will see big
[SPEAKER_01]: pharma getting involved and then creating
real alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: To pain medication and possibly other
indications that we just have to explore,
[SPEAKER_01]: secure, and really reliable communicate at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of guessing and a lot of
no-label prescriptions or off-label
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most successful product is Epidiolex,
which is a high CBD tincture that is for
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures as a first-line medication,
but at the end it's being prescribed for a
[SPEAKER_01]: wide range of indications as an off-label.
[SPEAKER_01]: With flower, we know it's no-label
prescription altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biosynthesis will just streamline the
whole process, be more focused and more
[SPEAKER_01]: clear to everybody involved, doctors,
pharmacists, patients, and caretakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it seems to be in the
biosynthesis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of the innovative
companies we see are targeting the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 and CB2 receptors themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on some research, the focus of 30%
of all FDA-approved drugs are focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that as being a new avenue,
let's say, for the cannabis industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically untouched as of yet for the
companies to do more research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development and develop products that are
going to be able to take patients to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next level of care?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an entirely new approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research of the endocannabinoid system
has been going on since, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more recently, we do look not only at
the cannabinoids themselves, but also at
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibitors and other forms of oil
enhancers to utilize these receptors more
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively, also in the context of other
medications, because it's rarely that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a cannabis therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often a mixed-form therapy,
so we have to understand how these
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors interact with other forms of
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next topic I wanted to jump onto
was sourcing the best products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are a wholesaler, importer,
and exporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific process that you guys
go to try and find the next best product
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming to the market, or is it
generally a case of the manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves have got good marketing
campaigns or have got good outreach
[SPEAKER_00]: programs where they're able to find the
companies like yourselves and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: marry the two companies together?
[SPEAKER_01]: We continue to scout the industry
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do a couple of levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: One level is getting the best flower,
dried flower, because currently still
[SPEAKER_01]: two-thirds of the market in Germany has
dried flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we had questions of quality,
and we still do.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, EUGMP in Germany is the
required quality level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we see GECP to GMP
hubs spread all over Europe and the world
[SPEAKER_01]: and bringing in flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at different levels of quality,
and this is something where we're very
[SPEAKER_01]: cautious what we choose because we have
the responsibility towards the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In tinctures and in extracts, we also look
at the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it being processed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the origin?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of biomass is used?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it been irradiated before or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, what we do is we look at
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do the research ourselves,
but we initiate processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like inhalators, patches, things that we
believe will be an important part in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of the medical cannabis world,
or medicinal cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are things where we source the
right companies, the right technologies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and see how we can implement these
technologies in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you look at it from a
surgical, we do have already established
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms of modes of delivery for other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medications and sometimes it's just about
understanding that parallel and
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing that to the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, let's say, the third stream of
our actions in providing the best sourced
[SPEAKER_01]: medications and therapies for patients and
pharmacies and doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently saw a sneak preview of some of
the German laws, and I was interested to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask you, as somebody who actually holds
sales and imports this, where do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: is currently producing the best medical
cannabis flour in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the ornamental flour up in Denmark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the likes of Materia Ventures in
Malta who are bringing in low-cost
[SPEAKER_00]: products from South America, Portugal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see the best flour currently
being made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we saw the rules that the German
law looks like you have to cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: within Germany, that there doesn't look
like there's going to be any imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's well, now you're referring to
the bullet points.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a paper of the government
regarding the legalization for the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is due to the international
treaties that we have, the Single-U.N.
[SPEAKER_01]: Convention and the Schengen Treaty that
were not allowed to import for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will have to, at least for the time
being, cultivate in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: That law may change by the time they
finally come to terms with legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's say it is that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only for recreational medical
cannabis will be still imported from
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, I believe the best operation,
when you ask me in Europe, we see very
[SPEAKER_01]: good reliable product from Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it depends who you talk to in
Portugal and what your partners are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very strong partner with the
state-of-the-art facility, the best
[SPEAKER_01]: post-harvest services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get our product from Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have product from Denmark,
from Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe, and we're exploring
currently the opportunity to import also
[SPEAKER_01]: from Switzerland, EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing is it has to be really
EUGMP and not just been, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: GCP grown and then dried and packaged in a
EUGMP facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's theoretically, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But practically, you have to look at a
couple of other aspects for it to really
[SPEAKER_01]: match our quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's a good bit of clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to the medical cannabis,
you'll still be able to import European
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only the recreational industry where
it's going to have to be cultivated within
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, because the treaties stand and
we are already importing for the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: or three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a fact that has been never
challenged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nobody who in the right mind
would minimize the medical market and
[SPEAKER_01]: providing to patients less product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we do have a tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three cultivators in Germany who
also provide to the German market at a set
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about two and a half tons,
from what I understand, per year in an
[SPEAKER_01]: overall market that has now grown to
around 10 tons in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we imported last year 20 tons,
but let's say some of it has been
[SPEAKER_01]: extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it goes to other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it is being destroyed because of,
say, end of stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around seven to 10 tons apparently last
year were sold as dried flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two and a half tons bedrock
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two and a half tons of German
grown from Demekan, Aurora and Afria that
[SPEAKER_01]: leave still at least five tons that need
to be imported in a growing market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a tendency, a necessity also to
enable that and just make sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality standards are being, say,
people stick to the quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very busy man and we're
nearing reaching our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep it too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could predict one good thing that
you think is going to happen in the German
[SPEAKER_00]: market over the next 12 months,
what would be the one thing that you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to see happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the next 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully they will go through from
discussing the law to actually drafting
[SPEAKER_01]: the law and passing it through the Senate
by fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be exactly 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we would have reached a lot and
established a lot and we'll be at a
[SPEAKER_01]: different place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, I also believe there
will be homegrown and social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are things not necessarily best
for the industry, but good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and good for those who won't have
access to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who wants to know more about
Alisana, the link to the website is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not following Boris already
on Twitter, I highly recommend to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the top voices in the European
medical cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boris, I know you're very busy,
so I'm not going to keep it too much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next episode, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh.
Oh.
