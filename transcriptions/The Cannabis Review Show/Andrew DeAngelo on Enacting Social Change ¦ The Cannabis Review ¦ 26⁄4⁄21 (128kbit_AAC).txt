[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the Cannabis
Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am absolutely delighted to be joined by
this man today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of black belts at the
cannabis industry on the show so far as
[SPEAKER_00]: CEOs, Chairman, Executive Directors,
but this man is one of the few senseis of
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and the world, and I'm
delighted to have him on with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Andrew DeAngelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you keeping, Andrew?
[SPEAKER_00]: You well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm well, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to be with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know,
Andrew, there's the very few.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the co-founder of Harborside,
co-founder of the California Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry Association, and most
importantly, co-founder of The Last
[SPEAKER_00]: Prisoner Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a strategic advisor to a ton of
the top blue chip companies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually found out from my research,
which I didn't notice, that it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to tell everybody he's pioneered
CBD medicines for to heal severely
[SPEAKER_00]: epileptic children, implemented the first
lab testing program in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, created child resistant
packaging for edible standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory tracking and initiated senior
outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a man with a wealth of knowledge
that I'm delighted to have on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for that wonderful
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started our dispensary in
06, none of those things had been done
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inventory tracking, lab testing,
senior outreach, cannabis medicine for
[SPEAKER_01]: children, all of that was never been done
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to invent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said, it's great when you look
at something that you consider so basic
[SPEAKER_00]: and simple to the industry, you kind of
forget the people who've led the way in
[SPEAKER_00]: creating the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump into the first topic,
and it's the Harborside model.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys created Harborside,
I know there's going to be an influx of
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries created in Europe over the
next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the one or two pillars that you
would highlight of the Harborside model
[SPEAKER_00]: that are paramount to the company that you
couldn't do without?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are three things I want
everybody to focus on when they're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about creating their dispensaries in
Europe or anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, pay attention to the plant,
the plant itself and the products itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure you have an
excellent selection of the finest products
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also want to make sure that
there's products available that are
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable for people who are poor or
working class and don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a medicine that's been the working
class and the poor medicine for many
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of years, and in fact,
even aristocratic medicine for many
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're bringing this out of the shadows
and into the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I want you to pay
attention to that we did at Harborside was
[SPEAKER_01]: the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the consumer is kind of being left
behind right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a close look at what's
happening in Canada and America,
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer is being left behind because
we're over-regulating and over-taxing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're probably going to have that
problem in Europe, at least in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, there'll be too much
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is the price of cannabis
goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard on the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important that we're nice to
the consumer, that we educate the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis products, that we create a
space that is welcoming for all walks of
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third thing I think is
important to pay attention to is your
[SPEAKER_01]: staff and your team.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked very hard to create an
inclusive, diverse culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off in Oakland, California,
which is right across the Bay from San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the most diverse
communities in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to make sure our staff was
diverse and we had to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were paying attention to how people work
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had to create a culture company
culture that focused on those two things I
[SPEAKER_01]: just talked about, the plant itself and
the plant itself and of course the team
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our culture was about respecting the
plant, respecting the customer and being
[SPEAKER_01]: good to each other because it's hard work
in selling cannabis and it is dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Society has a lot of fear with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's important that when we work
together, we're treating each other with
[SPEAKER_01]: kindness and compassion and we're trying
to set a culture in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not as brutally transactional as
we're seeing in corporate culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that separation from corporate
greed into one plan for all people is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that everybody should be looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing it moves kind of swiftly
into the next topic for us is enacting
[SPEAKER_00]: social change.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the tips that you'd give to some
of the activists and some of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to attempt this process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm thrilled to see so much activism
sort of rising in Europe now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, there just wasn't enough
activism happening in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Street, grassroots activism I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here in America, our tradition with
that is maybe a little bit different than
[SPEAKER_01]: it is in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know Europe has a very long,
maybe much longer tradition of course than
[SPEAKER_01]: America in terms of resisting dominant
culture, resisting authority and making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that justice is served when it comes
to the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most effective thing we did in the
United States for activism was we stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing the camera at the activists and
we started pointing the camera at the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we started pointing the camera at
the patients and the kids with epilepsy
[SPEAKER_01]: and people suffering, which I think you're
beginning to do that tactic in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I really encourage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stars of cannabis are our patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the people that are suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the fastest way to enact
change because people don't change through
[SPEAKER_01]: the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make all the rational arguments
about cannabis you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they're right, but it doesn't
move people.
[SPEAKER_01]: What moves people is the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we tell stories that move
people in the heart about how good this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is, that's when we change minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when even the political class
and the elites that make those decisions,
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it or not, they actually have
hearts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can move them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once enough people are moved
emotionally, that's when we can start
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the politicians to listen and
enact laws for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a guest on from New Zealand who
owns one of the big companies over there
[SPEAKER_00]: listed on the stock exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they recently hadn't passed their
legislation for legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me there was because religious
money had come into New Zealand and they
[SPEAKER_00]: had been doing the car crash and this one
guy killed five people 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of blunt trauma promotion,
whereas these guys just focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: education and the plant is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I think Europe needs to stand up
and realize that the other side are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to promote the most negative possible side
of cannabis they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to promote the most positive
side, which again is helping patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: changing people's lives, allowing them not
to suffer true seizures and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that needs to be the marketing
and advertising campaign that goes across
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, the prohibitionists are going to
tell their stories too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to try to hit people in
the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you hear a story about people
dying in a car accident and they blame it
[SPEAKER_01]: on weed or whatever, it might be like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are stories, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have to tell our
stories and let the people decide who's
[SPEAKER_01]: telling the truth and who's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do is move on to our
third topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's something that I know
there's a huge amount of people in Ireland
[SPEAKER_00]: alone trying to get through to the various
ministers and they're being completely
[SPEAKER_00]: ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter is pretty funny with the poor
politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timelines are getting bombarded by
hundreds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Irish population in itself is a
rebellious country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel sorry for the politicians over
the next coming year is what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come at them if they don't legalize this
plan pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are a couple of tips that you'd give
to some of the leading activists on how
[SPEAKER_00]: they get political engagement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a business show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get pretty good access to
politicians when you're coming at them
[SPEAKER_00]: from a business perspective and a jobs
creation perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be the other avenues that
you pursue or you'd advise people to
[SPEAKER_00]: pursue in terms of getting political
engagement?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably shouldn't mention that when we
were talking about activism a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is important that we tell the
stories of of patients and we put people
[SPEAKER_01]: through we hit people in the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing that we have to talk
about is just the tremendous economic
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that is what is going to move
decision makers and people in power
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps more than sick people,
well then use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Ireland, you have a wonderful
tradition of raising hell and being
[SPEAKER_01]: rebellious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to keep raising hell
and being rebellious with this issue until
[SPEAKER_01]: you hit a tipping point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we had to do in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in the United States with
legalization, more jobs are being created
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cannabis industry than any other
industry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more people employed than the coal
industry has employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more people in the cannabis,
more workers in cannabis than we do
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical engineers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are, I think, something like a
quarter million people employed in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are good jobs, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are jobs that pay more than the
minimum wage.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are jobs that have full health care
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: In America, you have to buy your own
health care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the employers in the cannabis industry
help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And retirement benefits also come with
employment in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want good paying jobs in Ireland,
you've got to legalize this plant not just
[SPEAKER_01]: for medicine, but you farm beautiful in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a micro climate that is excellent
for industrial hemp and anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: made out of cotton, anything that's made
out of timber, anything that's made out of
[SPEAKER_01]: petroleum, basically can be made out of
hemp and other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I would encourage people
to argue in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the if the compassionate arguments not
working so good, the economic argument can
[SPEAKER_01]: work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you need to put some poor people
in front of the camera that or maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to come to America and film all the
economic activity here and interview some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people whose lives have been
changed, who used to work at Amazon in a
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they work in a job that has meaning
for them, where they help people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: sick and they spread this medicine and
they spread this goodness and they feel
[SPEAKER_01]: really good about their jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when people feel good about their
jobs, what do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They go out to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take better care of their families.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy nicer clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy nicer automobiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They build up their life and they create
even more economic activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the economics of cannabis, this is not
a new billion dollar industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a trillion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to make it illegal and to turn your
back on that is is beyond irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're robbing the people of their
birthright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's simply unacceptable for any
politician to do that anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind is at our backs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ireland, the wind is at your backs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it doesn't feel like it,
you have a whole global community of
[SPEAKER_01]: people like me that are cheering you on
and ready to help at any moment's notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The day will come for Ireland and it will
be a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go now, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another positive note.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see Ireland being the base for Europe,
for a lot of North American companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good tax rate, corporate tax
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a highly skilled, young
workforce.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, some of the best farmers
in the world already over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to be able to flip in to make
the premium cannabis brand, we're never
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the mass producer like a
Columbia, but we can make the Guinness and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make the Kerrygold and we can make
that global product that everybody wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: While at the same time, selling services
to the larger companies who are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: position in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been an absolute pleasure talking
to you, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could literally talk to you all day,
but we have the 15 minute rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to follow Andrew,
if you're not doing it already,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be your city person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to his Twitter is Andrew underscore to
Angelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get him on LinkedIn, get him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're an absolute gentleman coming
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're such a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to get to chat to you again
towards the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some positive news coming
out of Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to appear again and hopefully
I'll get to come to Ireland and be with
[SPEAKER_01]: all the cannabis people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mate, if you come to Ireland, we will roll
out the red carpet and have you the
[SPEAKER_00]: freshest roll blaze that you could
possibly have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking forward to that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, everybody,
and see you on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
Oh, yeah.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
