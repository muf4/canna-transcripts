[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the next cannabis
review, the final episode of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in for an end of year review on
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am joined by Matthew O'Brien of The
Green Paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matthew, how are you keeping today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never been better, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I greatly appreciate the opportunity to
join you on this occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it last year, so I think we're
going to have to make this an annual
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a pretty great year with 4pm
being acquired and you're now on your way
[SPEAKER_00]: to being one of the media centre points of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, congratulations on that mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a lot to cover in the 15
minutes today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, and I hope it's the first of
many Irish cannabis companies that succeed
[SPEAKER_01]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have no doubt at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good things to come in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's kick things off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wanted to keep it to 15 minutes,
so I'm going to start off pretty simple
[SPEAKER_00]: and straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do an end of year review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grade North America and
we're going to grade Europe from,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, regular grading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to let you start or if you
want me to start with Europe, I'll give my
[SPEAKER_00]: grade and I'll give you my reasoning why
and then we can have a little discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: as to see if we're both right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you kicking off on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so I can get a sense as to what the
format would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll start off with Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, basically, we're going to give Europe,
I think, it's a B plus to an A minus is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm looking to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of muddy waters when
it comes to the CB industry, but the leaps
[SPEAKER_00]: and bounds that are happening are
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaps and bounds, they're not just kind of
dribs and drabs of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, obviously legalizing what we'll
get is one of the biggest moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg talking to do it, but the
actual matter coming in Italy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the made in Denmark products that are
getting licensed for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the acquisitions that are happening,
the listings that happened in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as they're not part of Europe
anymore, we're going to consider them part
[SPEAKER_00]: of Europe for the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think there's a lot to be
positive about in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been massive strides ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the North American
brands, I saw a lot of the finance calls
[SPEAKER_00]: and shareholder meetings where they're
adding a billion valuation on the German
[SPEAKER_00]: market and kind of adding this to future
earnings of capital, which I think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit ahead of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a stiff battle against a
couple of the European brands that we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know that are going to be here fighting
for this territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just going to walk in and
automatically be able to make market
[SPEAKER_00]: share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think there's a lot of positives
ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe North American companies might be
getting a little bit ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's certainly room for
improvement as there always is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's been a very important
year for the Europeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada's industry, and I really get the
sense that Europe is really putting the
[SPEAKER_01]: foot down on the pedal so that they can
catch up with our neighbors in North
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, there's still a lot to do and
there's still a lot of tape to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see over in Ireland here,
a lot of the CBE products getting stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: at customs and taken off the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see this happening across
Europe and people that are talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there seems to be something happening
in the background to allow, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the companies that have already got
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say some of them have got novel food
applications approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with all due respect to the companies
that are getting their products stopped,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the way the free markets work.
[SPEAKER_00]: These companies have spent the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got their foot in the door now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's up to you to be able to compete
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is competition to be had there,
would you agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it or hate it, that's the conditions
which are all subject to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a free market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone and everyone can apply for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those certifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this industry is going to be regulated
to death for many, many more years to
[SPEAKER_01]: come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if anyone is deterred by the current
sort of regulatory environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good opportunity just to
perhaps take notice that potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: there's another industry you want to
participate in because this is the future
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: For better or worse, it's going to be
regulated and overregulated for many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all in all, progress, but a good
insight for any entrepreneurs who are
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially seeking to get a piece of this
pie that this is just the environment you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to grow accustomed to operating
within.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating the brand is going to be
secondary in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be about regulatory framework,
industry nuances, how different
[SPEAKER_00]: territories operate within the rules and
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's not like North America where
brands came first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's move on to North America and
let's give me your grade on how... Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do Canada and America separately
or do you want to bunch them in together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see if I can do a bit of a separation
because I think they are quite different
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of Canada, I give Canada a B
plus and I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: separate what's happening in the cannabis
stock market versus what's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in the Canadian cannabis market
because ultimately, a lot of the attention
[SPEAKER_01]: is devoted to the larger Canadian cannabis
companies, whether that's a company like
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilray or Aurora or Canobie Growth and
ultimately, they've failed to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations for the last two years in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made wildly ambitious promises to
their investors as the percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: market share that they could capture and a
lot of these companies are coming to the
[SPEAKER_01]: realization that the products they're
producing are simply inferior in
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison to Kraft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, ultimately, if you look at the
market, as I said, as opposed to the stock
[SPEAKER_01]: market, we have seen a huge increase this
year in total sales of Kraft cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is that it's nearly up
10x year to date now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, that did start at a pretty low
point because Kraft cannabis producers
[SPEAKER_01]: were only eligible to bring their products
to market within the last 24 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, it did start at a small base.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that's been a huge success story
in the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not brought us to a point whereby a
lot of these larger companies are really
[SPEAKER_01]: having to evaluate which particular
categories of cannabis they're focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: and ultimately, we're starting to see a
much more mature cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada whereby producers are starting to
really focus on particular form factors as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to trying to be all things to all
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I'd say Canada, a B plus,
I think it's done a great job with the
[SPEAKER_01]: rollout of 2.0 products, whether that's
beverage beverages, edibles, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think there's a lot of room for
improvement in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: In certain provinces, cannabis retailers
still aren't actually able to perform
[SPEAKER_01]: e-commerce sales in the world we live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just an necessity for any
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely a potential room for
improvement for Canadian regulators and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully, in the upcoming review of the
cannabis act, that will be somewhere on
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of their priority list.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of the United States,
I think it's very much a mixed bagel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would generally say maybe a C plus is
probably a fair grade for the performance
[SPEAKER_01]: of that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we have seen three bills that
are currently in place which would
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively legalize cannabis at a federal
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albeit we could consider that progress,
we are seeing a certain fragmentation of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Democratic Party whereby you have the
majority leader of the Senate Chuck
[SPEAKER_01]: Schumacher who is saying that he will
literally oppose any bill which is not his
[SPEAKER_01]: bill such that he can potentially capture
the political points of legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now in the States,
cannabis has very much become front and
[SPEAKER_01]: center of politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely a good sign and I think
inevitably it will result in the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, and I'd like to get your
perspective on this, I don't think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: good thing whereby there are too many
politicians in a single party who are
[SPEAKER_01]: actively competing against one another to
get the political points associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: passing this legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the way I look at America is
there's been sizable gains in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: level in terms of the growth of the market
share, obviously federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still the big domino effect to happen
but I think what you've got happening now
[SPEAKER_00]: is the posture in between the Democrats
and the Republicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see the capital and the finance
and the markets are moving in this way and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's now going to be like we want the pat
on the back coming into election.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see who's going to be able to hold
this cherry and say that they got the
[SPEAKER_00]: young vote or they got the new millennial
vote out with this move.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I think it's a great sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that both parties are put in
papers for an industry is an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them are going to beat the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've now got them actively competing
with each other for the industry's
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd agree with you on America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot to be done in that
territory but big gains had this year as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few other points I'd like to add on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few really interesting statistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is now the fifth largest cash
crop in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of all the crops in their agricultural
industry, cannabis is now the fifth most
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable crop and that's just determining
the wholesale revenue, the revenue being
[SPEAKER_01]: generated from farmers selling it to
retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, sales are going to surpass
$22 billion this year in legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: How outrageous is it that $22 billion in
legal cannabis sales, despite the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's federally legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: To your point, we know of two political
parties who are competing against one
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only believe that this is going to
act as a further catalyst to decrease the
[SPEAKER_01]: timeline for which federal legalization
will occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, when that does occur,
I think we're just going to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: floodgates truly open.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've seen up until this point has
been fantastic, but once you have
[SPEAKER_01]: Interstate Commerce and cannabis brands in
California are able to start shipping
[SPEAKER_01]: their products from west coast to east
coast, I think we're going to see an
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous amount of cash flow into this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say insignificant,
but I think it will seem a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: insignificant as to what will likely
follow in the four years that will come
[SPEAKER_01]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest one of them all is the
New York legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to jump in to the second or
third biggest industry in America,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not tying with California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most significant thing is that
it's so close to Europe in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: perception by Europeans, in terms of Irish
people, and in terms of business people in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have bases over here in
Europe, whereas California companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado companies necessarily don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just that close proximity to a
market that's going to explode and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to prove that the capital gains and
the job creations are there is another
[SPEAKER_00]: positive for Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to watch and see and have the
influence come over the politicians and
[SPEAKER_00]: decision makers over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be naive as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital moves everything and the capital
hasn't been able to get into these markets
[SPEAKER_00]: yet and a lot of the capital is situated
in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's going to be an interesting
year to say the least from March next year
[SPEAKER_00]: when everything kicks off over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, and to really tie a bow tie,
I'm at right now 321,000 people have paid
[SPEAKER_01]: full-time employment in the legal cannabis
industry in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not an outrageous amount of
employment that industry is now providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, despite the fact that cannabis
remains federally illegal, so very excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about what's happening on a state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully when we're having this
conversation next year, there might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more progress made on the
federal legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rob, we're going to move on to the next
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pick two of the biggest
moments of 2021 each.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got like four or five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can stretch over maybe a minute past
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm going to keep it to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cat of waking up there behind
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll kick things off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two are the ones that I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little discussion before and I
think we're agreed on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big one for me is the jazz
acquisition of GW Pharma for $7.4 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The talk of it was back in February,
but it was confirmed in May when I went
[SPEAKER_00]: through the listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's such a significant play,
especially coming from a UK company that's
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly where it's completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the second biggest manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: or exporter of medical cannabis in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one of those funny scenarios
that you really got capital in the markets
[SPEAKER_00]: now over this side of the water,
not just in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be the big moment for
me, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: For myself, I have to highlight the fact
that Germany is not on course to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having lived in Ireland for the better
part of my life and having a decent
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding as to how certain
legislation is crafted by politicians in
[SPEAKER_01]: the EU, I have the sense that there is
going to be significant ramifications of a
[SPEAKER_01]: nation state like Germany legalizing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, leapfrogging in the United
States were by Colorado for state to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize cannabis for adult use purposes
back in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had a 10 year head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite that, the Germans have caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're going to be the
first major European nation to effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: embrace the adult use or the adult use
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that's the top moment of 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get the sense that that is going to
have huge ramifications for the European
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully our politicians in Ireland
are taking note as to what our German
[SPEAKER_01]: counterparts are putting in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think you agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got Germany going in,
everything goes according to plan there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've interviewed the top of the top
companies in Germany, some of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in that industry are razor
sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to be a big,
big, big success in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no flesh on the bone on any of the
companies I've talked over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is up to date as any territory in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that triggers in France to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get France and Germany doing
anything in Europe, it's pretty much a
[SPEAKER_00]: landslide across the board, everywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what we're saying in the previous
conversation, the markets will then be
[SPEAKER_00]: alive where the M&A has happened,
where the new territories for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, yeah, a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my second one then, I'm chosen between
two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know whether you're going to
pick the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's either between Amazon change in
their cannabis employee policy or the UFC
[SPEAKER_00]: change in their cannabis employee policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, a massive sporting firm which
kind of opened the floodgates to the NFL
[SPEAKER_00]: on a couple of orders to stop cannabis
testing for THC and not ban athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Amazon triggering then what
allowed Apple to stop banning their apps
[SPEAKER_00]: on their app store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of big tech and sport,
both aligned with lifting the ban on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going to go for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one, just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to piggyback on your suggestion
regarding Amazon and Apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that the two most valuable
companies in the world, like literally the
[SPEAKER_01]: two most valuable companies in the world,
both updated their policies in favor of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it just speaks volume to the
progress which is being made as to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that previously was a misconceptions
associated what cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're now reaching a point,
thankfully, whereby people are aware that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is not the danger or struggle it
was once made out to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And consequently, you have companies like
Apple and Amazon who are starting to take
[SPEAKER_01]: note of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In America, there's 68% of the population
are in favor of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with labor shortages, they're
identifying that in order for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: retain and attract the highest quality
people to their companies, they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: update their policies such that they are
taking a more sort of progressive position
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that is a huge milestone for
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have companies that are able to
actually list apps on the app store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, it's just the fact that the two
most valuable companies in the world have
[SPEAKER_01]: both simultaneously started embracing
cannabis just tells a very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: tale as to the progress this industry has
made in the last number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember from last
year, one of our top five things was Jay-Z
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the celebrity world embracing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 12 months later, we've got the biggest
tech companies in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty good year as much as there's
been a lot of shit shows and garbage being
[SPEAKER_00]: spewed by a lot of people who weren't as
informed as they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's definitely coming to an
end, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the fear mongering, we've seen a
lot less of it this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's continued to decline as more
people have access to the information,
[SPEAKER_01]: which ultimately informs the fact that
this is a very safe substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've had some of the biggest
viewing episodes on this show now have
[SPEAKER_00]: been like Dr. Peter Grimspoon from Harvard
Medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had Dr. Onoive from William
Patterson University, the head of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurology in Toronto Medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can only refuse and have these
arguments so long before you start looking
[SPEAKER_00]: like a crazy person in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really getting that inflection point
of shit up and sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a great Christmas with
your family and I look forward to talking
[SPEAKER_00]: to you in the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But best of luck with the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything goes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Wisonman, congrats on the success of
the cannabis review this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thoroughly enjoying all the high
quality interviews you've been putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much to all the
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last episode of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every guest that we've had on,
there's been maybe 40 or 50 now at this
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is nothing without the guests
coming on and the informed people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Matthew has given us their knowledgeable
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much to all the viewers
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's at a great 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be blazing it up at the end of the
year and I look forward to seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody at the start of 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
