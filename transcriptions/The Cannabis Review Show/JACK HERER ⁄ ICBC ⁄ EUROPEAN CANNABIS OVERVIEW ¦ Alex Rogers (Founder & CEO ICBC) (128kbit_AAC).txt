[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody to the latest episode of
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to be joined on this
episode by a man of renowned intellect in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Alex Roger, who's the founder of the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex, how are you keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been chasing you for a long time to
try and get you on the show, so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: delighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're going to have a wealth of
information for the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kick things off with
something that I know probably everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to like.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people already know you're part
of the industry, but the first topic is
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Harare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got a lot of stories with
this in your early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give everybody an overview of the
character of Jack Harare, why he was
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Hempher?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack was basically my mentor, my original
mentor in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis industry, you know,
it was a lot different 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Jack in 93 in Santa Cruz,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was touring around California and
America, and he was just promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's called the Hempher because he wrote a
book called The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the book first came out in
like 84 or 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was basically about why hemp was
made illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty, it was a succinct and
concise kind of overview of why we're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing in a time of prohibition for
cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was insanely passionate about the
movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't smoke weed until he was 30 and
got out of the army.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when he did smoke weed,
he was like, damn, they've been lying to
[SPEAKER_01]: me the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty benign stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said it was like the devil's
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something just lit up in him and he
became the Hempher.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody that I could even think of
that came close to pushing cannabis reform
[SPEAKER_01]: more than Jack Hare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a gruff old son of a buck and
he took no prisoners and he was just very
[SPEAKER_01]: direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you weren't into
cannabis being legalized like tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: as he would say, then he wasn't,
or wine, he wasn't into your model of over
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought it to be a very benign thing
and that everybody should have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he fought until his dying day to make
that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very thick skin in the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there was a lot of shade thrown
his way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, we were out on the,
being out on Haight Ashbury or Telegraph
[SPEAKER_01]: Avenue with Jack or down at the LA
Coliseum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the parking lot, even in the
parking lot of the Deadshows, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, you never know who would be
like, more like when it was on the street
[SPEAKER_01]: though, when people would come up and have
our signs with legalizing weed and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would admonish us and chastise us or
laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say nobody's laughing now,
Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to move on to the next topic
because it's a pretty huge and popular
[SPEAKER_00]: conference that happens in the three major
cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give everybody an overview of how
you set up the OCBC, its history and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the plans are for the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically I've been producing events
my whole life, mostly music events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about 10 years ago, I own a big
medical marijuana clinic in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 10 years ago, we're getting all
these questions that were asked to us
[SPEAKER_01]: about this new burgeoning industry in
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two and two equal four to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, let's put this
conference together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we created the biggest B2B
conference in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I had lived in Europe for eight
years and was very, very euro,
[SPEAKER_01]: euro savvy and euro passionate,
I wanted to do events over there and all
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just saw a niche in international
cannabis business in 2014, basically is
[SPEAKER_01]: when I came up with the idea for the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just pushed forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to, basically I went to
Germany, I went to Berlin and the Germans
[SPEAKER_01]: were like, oh, Alex, we are so worried for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not know if an event like this will
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: $500 a ticket is a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, I'm worried for me
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just took a big chance and I just
went for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Berlin now has become the biggest B2B
event in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're scaling that event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year it's going to be almost 5,000
people in about 350 companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: With over 75 countries represented.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are scaling that model big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just knew Germany is kind of the
center of continental Europe and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they do goes Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured they're going to eventually
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did with medical, they are now with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization looks on the horizon and
looks like it's on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise I do these other satellite
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teamed up with Spanavis, it's the
biggest consumer event in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do the one day B2B before then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do a series of investment
events in Zurich, Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be in Croatia next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to do a series on a
Mediterranean retreat series.
[SPEAKER_01]: All small, really intimate events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's about 250 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barcelona with Spanavis, that's about a
thousand people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Berlin is the event we're scaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're keeping our other events
really intimate and just smaller and not
[SPEAKER_01]: scaling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more niche marketed events for
targeted, exact industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the main scalable event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd highly recommend anybody who hasn't
been to the one in Berlin should
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely book their ticket for next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was three just previously happened
in August, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we pulled it off in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was miracles do happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the challenges around those
events, I'm sure will be less hindered
[SPEAKER_00]: next year where there'll be more freedom
and accessibility for people to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So book your tickets for next year before
it sells out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to move on to the last topic,
which is an overview of European cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got just a deep understanding
yourself of the various different
[SPEAKER_00]: territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recent elections in Germany bode well
for a legalized industry over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know on the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a, you might be able to inform the
viewers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, we've been following this for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've called it the Jamaica coalition
and the SPD, which are basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: conservatives, excuse me, the CDU,
which are basically the conservatives have
[SPEAKER_01]: been in power for now, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although we even saw a little bit of
movement with the CDU, we had a member of
[SPEAKER_01]: the CDU speak at the last ICBC,
which was historical.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what we see now in Germany is a
huge shake up and they're going to form,
[SPEAKER_01]: the coalition will probably be with the
greens and the FTP party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with the social Democrats,
so it looks like the CDU, the conservative
[SPEAKER_01]: government will not be part of this new
coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so two of the three members of the
coalition have clear and succinct plans
[SPEAKER_01]: for legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when I asked my most pessimistic,
cynical German friends of how they feel
[SPEAKER_01]: about legalization a year ago,
they would have been like, we're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everyone seems to think that
legalization is on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just since the last few months,
when we could see what the polling numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: were for the election, everything's
completely shaken up in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people think that
legalization is, it'll be on the forefront
[SPEAKER_01]: of the new coalition's agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the legal experts in the cannabis
industry in Germany are going to do well
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next 12 to 24 months with the
applications of licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very happy about the election
results when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's specifically, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other territories we saw Luxembourg
recede a little bit, basically on their
[SPEAKER_00]: big announcement that they're going to
have an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know whether it was,
that was just one outlier of a politician
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking at a turn or did you hear more
about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, here's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think after all this, everyone thinks it
could be Luxembourg or Sweden or Portugal,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they have ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, Switzerland, Luxembourg or
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are going to be the places
that will legalize first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually think it's going to be
Germany now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Germany will be the first
country to legalize a robust real
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, not a decrim, but a
recreational full market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was the case with
medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that I wouldn't have predicted
this a year ago, but now I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany will actually have the first clear
legalization laws in Europe before
[SPEAKER_01]: Luxembourg, before Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Luxembourg and Switzerland are really
important, but Switzerland is even more
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when Germany legalizes, then Europe
goes where Germany goes generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'll be a seminal moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's my big bold prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that's if you get Germany
going and then France goes hand in hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll have a European flip within
12 to 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be that close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really actually think that it might be
within 12 to 18 months.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously the medical industry is
leading the way at the moment in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much where all the talk is
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of territories with
Denmark, have their made in Denmark brand
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in the pharmaceutical industry,
strong presence in pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta, same strong presence in pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've started processing product coming
into there, turning it into goods with the
[SPEAKER_00]: made in Malta sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see those two territories having a
leg up on everywhere else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you see somewhere like the UK or
Ireland, which has already got the home
[SPEAKER_00]: base for a lot of the major global
headquarters for companies here anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it's a reason why cannabis
might not be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think the previous
infrastructure matters necessarily of
[SPEAKER_01]: where someone's poised in terms of a
pharma perspective, because this is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, though it is pharma and
though that infrastructure could be used,
[SPEAKER_01]: it one day might be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, you see, I think Denmark is
pretty much the Malta has its niche,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're next to bedrock and from
Holland, Denmark's putting the most
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis into the medical market in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing it in a way that's
efficient, smart, a good price,
[SPEAKER_01]: a decent product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the West Coast, so all of the
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Denmark with their past in
ornamental flower growing and the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: strong tissue culture departments that
they've got up there, they seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing as premium a product as they've
gotten within a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, they did what Holland
should have done and what we expected
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe Holland or the Netherlands to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Denmark just kind of stepped in
and took it to the next level when Holland
[SPEAKER_01]: was they never had the advocacy or the
organization to push something like this
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next degree like Denmark did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of monopoly with bedrock
and then they have their coffee shop
[SPEAKER_01]: scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, so I was surprised Holland
didn't do it, you know, but Denmark did it
[SPEAKER_01]: and they took the reins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see the fact that Europe is an
intercultural heavy society and
[SPEAKER_00]: civilization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once legalization comes, do you see
Ireland having its own strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: France having its own strain, Spain having
its own dominant strain and a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: nuanced almost like wine or something like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that that's just what
cannabis is and what cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the region will help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the southern regions are
better, but because it is so in America,
[SPEAKER_01]: we grow a lot of outdoor cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in but in Europe, because it's a
little more clinical, a lot of it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be at least at the beginning,
mandated by the clinics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like soil grown, sun grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's just a more chill profile,
not as big up and down, a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the luxury of that because I live
on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think that I think every,
you know, the sooner people, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: countries legalize first or get into the
game, they're going to be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: this like branding advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also saying, oh, that's some Slovenian
weed or that's something that the Irish
[SPEAKER_01]: boys lads know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got it all dialed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so so now is the time to
put these ideas together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really brands start branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only the weed, but then added value
products from that area also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that the customer will buy
into specific culture like they do with
[SPEAKER_00]: every other brand, whether it's the taste
of freshness or Ireland or whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the cool chillness of Spain or Portugal or
whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go, I'd be remiss to ask
you, a man who lives in the West Coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the best strain that you've ever
found or consumed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, we like the O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get that pure O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush, it's it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the cookies, the Girl Scout
cookies, the train wreck here in southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon is popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these all these strains are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I will say this, though,
for me, my personal strain was I lived in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam 20 years ago and there was a
coffee shop called the Katsu and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized in sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right when you walked in this coffee
shop, you could smell the distinct smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the opposite of Kush,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush is the hardcore indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the hazes were the hardcore
sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the West Coast, we have
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the best weed, the best options,
the best everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we don't have still is someone
will say, oh, that's part haze or that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a hybrid sativa dominant or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no more pure sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like when I walked into the Katsu
in Amsterdam years ago and smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's haze or the silver pearl or the
super silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: These don't exist on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could ever get some like old
school haze like that, it would be it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as green as the grass is here,
we don't have that one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, which is which is the haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a total sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, we like the Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush out here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an absolute gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time out for me and the viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for everybody, check out the website
below InternationalCBC.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend booking your tickets for
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for your time,
Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Owen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
Oh.
