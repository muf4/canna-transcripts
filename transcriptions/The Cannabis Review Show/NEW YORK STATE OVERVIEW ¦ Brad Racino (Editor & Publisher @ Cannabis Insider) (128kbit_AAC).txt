[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to next episode of the
Cannabis Review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm delighted to be joined in this episode
by Brad Racino, he's the editor and
[SPEAKER_01]: publisher at Cannabis Insider New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you keeping today Brad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me on,
mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been following all the articles
you've got published in 80 and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: done to a very high caliber so I've been
dying to have a chat with you and get your
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion on the New York State as opposed
to just the New York city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you maybe give a everybody a quick
little overview of how you got into the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Insider from the industry that
you're in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an investigative reporter and editor
in San Diego, California for the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years and relocated to New York last year
with my family to be closer to the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my family and was looking for some kind of
a position that would allow me to dig deep
[SPEAKER_00]: into something really interesting and
boom, cannabis was right there waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just timing was perfect and we launched
late last year and hired our first
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter late last year and started
actually publishing in February of this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a few months and it's been going
really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very under covered industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of major publications still
aren't taking it seriously yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very surprising, but also good
news for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a fascinating journey so far
and really fun to watch as this market
[SPEAKER_00]: develops from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think New York is probably one
of the most interesting territories with
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of capital that's available to
businesses that are over there that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising to see that none of the big
publications have been doing this properly
[SPEAKER_01]: and the caliber you guys are writing at is
a testimony to the talent you guys have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to jump into basically the first
topic and it's New York State overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've already had a couple of guests
on to talk about New York City and the
[SPEAKER_01]: five boroughs and whatnot, but from
Buffalo to Rochester to the five boroughs,
[SPEAKER_01]: where do you see the concentration of
cultivation happening in New York State?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's interesting because when
people talk about this market,
[SPEAKER_00]: they only so far, I really hear
discussions about retail and about
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail, everyone seems to want to be in
New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation is happening upstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the vast expanses of land
are, where the farms are, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers already are, where they've been
growing hemp for the last several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now can turn those into THC growing farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from Western New York, I'm in central
New York right now, Syracuse area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go directly west from here,
you hit Buffalo right by the border,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go directly east, you hit Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those cities, Buffalo, Rochester,
Syracuse, Albany are all prepping for this
[SPEAKER_00]: market in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some people, yes, looking for
retail locations, but others really
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to get their hand in the
cultivation, the processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of talk about distribution
up here and how that's actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen and play out because this is a huge
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people talk about New York,
they usually think of New York City and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't think, wow, the rest of this,
it goes all the way up to the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: border, all the way west to the Great
Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of land to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be an interesting market
to watch and how that develops up here
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, a lot of politicians,
there's a politician, a senator in
[SPEAKER_00]: Rochester who's been on the forefront of
introducing new legislation around the
[SPEAKER_00]: business marketplace of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of local politicians at least here
in Syracuse who are still navigating the
[SPEAKER_00]: waters of how their community feels toward
this topic and whether they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: institute zoning laws to keep these things
separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's playing out in a bunch of different
ways up here, but it's all interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know where the cultivation of retail is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the extraction facilities and
the lab testing and then the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things, are these going to be
basically in cities that are already open?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you manufacturing these
facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you starting to see new facilities
being dropped up in certain locations
[SPEAKER_01]: around the state?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, everybody can't be setting up a
facility around New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only going to be so much business
to go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm not an expert on this yet
because there hasn't been a lot of talk of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for the lab side of things,
there's only two labs in the entire state
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one relatively new one I think
down in the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know where the other one
is, but that's all there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some talk of people starting new
labs, but again, everyone's hesitant
[SPEAKER_00]: because the regulations are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea what this is going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you invest that amount of money,
a lot of people are hesitant to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Processing, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some really interesting
partnerships, especially with private
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and Native American nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some joint partnerships in
developing cultivation and processing
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities in a couple of parts of the
state, which is really interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I don't have any more info on that
because again, the regs aren't even out in
[SPEAKER_00]: draft form for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the regulations, the logistics
laws, shall we say, haven't even been
[SPEAKER_01]: drafted and put out to people because I
can imagine that's going to be one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: areas of contention and profitability with
the size of New York that haven't flared
[SPEAKER_01]: distributed at a premium quality across
the state is going to be of a permanent
[SPEAKER_01]: importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it safe from theft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge missing piece of this
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Office of Cannabis Management and
the Cannabis Control Board has said
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly as recently as just a couple of
weekends ago that they expect product on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelves by this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just four months away falls in
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this huge element of you got
retail regulations out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have conditional cultivation
regulations out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about everything in between?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does it get from the cultivation
facility to the retail stores?
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, if you're transporting or you
have more than three ounces, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are you going to transport that
stuff from the facility to the retail shop
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have distributors license or
you don't have regulations around it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things that are missing
and a lot of people are very concerned for
[SPEAKER_00]: the timeline of when this stuff actually
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I seem to think that that's one of
the big huge things that everybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: been missing so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK to grow and it's OK to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting it from A to B hasn't really
been as much yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to jump on to the next topic,
and it's Fifth Avenue stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was over in New York last weekend,
as you know yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we were over there, we were
seeing a lot of mobile dispensaries around
[SPEAKER_01]: the place and they looked like these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were only pretty much on Fifth
and Seventh Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in kind of the touristy areas,
but they were selling THC flower edibles,
[SPEAKER_01]: vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the CBD stores pretty much had THC
stuff there already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you see these kind of places being
the future of purchases in New York or do
[SPEAKER_01]: you see Fifth Avenue Apple sized cannabis
dispensaries happening over in the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really, really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you, I was just in the city last
weekend and same experience, walked into a
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD store and just for fun said,
what do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, we just laid everything out
all from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not an expert in consumer
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the state of New York or city of New
York, I don't know what people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the OCM and the CCB think that the
regulated market is going to contain safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: tested, verifiable product that people can
trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's okay to pay more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to pay a premium for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's got to be a level where people
are saying, if I can get an eighth of
[SPEAKER_00]: California flower off this guy on the
street for 20 bucks, but I have to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 at a retail location, there's going to
be something, a give and take there where
[SPEAKER_00]: people just aren't willing to go above and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that for the time being,
those gray market sellers and retailers
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to dominate the New York city
landscape and the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think it's going to be a while
before those Fifth Avenue stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: retail chains are up and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first round of retail licenses in the
state of New York are going to be given to
[SPEAKER_00]: justice involved applicants and the actual
retail stores where they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: selling from, are already predetermined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are built out using state and
private equity funds, the $200 million
[SPEAKER_00]: fund that the governor has said she set
aside for this particular reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly doubt those stores are going
to be built to the caliber of like an
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple or a Saks Fifth Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be well after those
stores are established and have a foothold
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think the OCM is going to now then
allow the big boys to come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people with the well-heeled interest,
the big pockets to establish that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be, I mean, I would not be
surprised if it were two years from now
[SPEAKER_00]: before those stores even opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the next year to two years is
really going to determine what users get
[SPEAKER_00]: accustomed to, what they're willing to pay
for, the experience that they are going
[SPEAKER_00]: for in New York city to kind of habituate
themselves to like what they're after,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want to see in the New York city
retail market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that those people with the
trucks and the people already with the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: stores definitely have a strong foothold
for the time being.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think I couldn't agree with you
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the next few years,
they've got a little pot of gold that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be made there before the real
capital comes into the market and puts the
[SPEAKER_01]: real legality and the laws up against
these stores and either shuts them down or
[SPEAKER_01]: stops them selling the product that
they're going to make monetization from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you guys have a
conference on May the 20th, if I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: mistaken as well, anybody who's watching
this who's in New York or highly around
[SPEAKER_01]: checking it out, the website for a
cannabis insider is just below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I'm sure going to be a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next topic that I want to talk to you
about before we go is the current
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I was actually reading
about on your side was the acreage
[SPEAKER_01]: holdings court case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the current landscape,
do you see the big boys being able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: away with an oligopoly over there or do
you see that that court case is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go in favor of the smaller defendants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That case in particular, I wouldn't feel
confident weighing in on it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is a David versus Goliath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really interesting case to see how
it plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you got acreage, which has got
very deep pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure a team of attorneys going up
against a much smaller plaintiff who's
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing these charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I honestly I don't I wouldn't feel
comfortable weighing in on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll jump on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the job reports and the job
statistics that I was looking about
[SPEAKER_01]: reading about is that within the next five
years, New Yorker looked at 50,000 jobs to
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the New York state as a whole or
New York City?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's the state as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they solid numbers based on other
relative industries in the state like
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol or tobacco or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we first saw those numbers,
I was skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so had our reporter Sean Tehan look
into it and say, hey, can you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: verify that this is real, that they're not
just pulling these numbers out of nowhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a story on it just a few weeks
ago, maybe a month ago, where he talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of experts who said, actually,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these are legitimate numbers and
legitimate forecast that we can that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of lean into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it is it is based on other
states, but they have seen play out over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the the unionization kind of mandate
that all of these licensees have some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of labor project labor agreement with with
unions and unions are very strong in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and the entire northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge job pool or applicant
pool from which they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, a lot of people in
labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I think that those numbers are
at least legit, if not being slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative, because there's as you know,
there's so many ancillary businesses and
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are going to spring up
around this, some that we've never even
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of things that just are outside
the realm right now that will make a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of sense in a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's things coming around the
corner that people can see as of yet that
[SPEAKER_01]: might turn some of this parts of this
industry on its head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming up to their time now,
Brad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let you go because I know
you've got a busy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you very much for taking
your time to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody who hasn't subscribed or
signed up for New York State cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: insider, I could highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The writing and the articles are very well
put together and very well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a credit to you and your team,
Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very pleasure talking to you, mate,
and chat to you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
