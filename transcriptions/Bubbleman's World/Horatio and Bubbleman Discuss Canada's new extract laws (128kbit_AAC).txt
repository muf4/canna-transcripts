[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've done this before one tape
Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with Horatio Delbert and we are
at the CCH Q vapor lounge on the second
[SPEAKER_02]: floor nice private place for us to shoot
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know wanted to get together and
celebrate Major victory in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's for the most part it's status
quam BC But for all of our brethren around
[SPEAKER_02]: the country they get to explore something
new It's huge what of course Horatio was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about is the Smith versus Regina
case Owen Smith and Ted Smith who was the
[SPEAKER_02]: owner of the dispensary that the bakery
was working for at the time of the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: bust a Couple years ago the judge struck
down the word dried out of dried marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: And he changed the definition of just us
being allowed to have cannabis into being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to have anything Cannabis so when you
remove the word drive then now all of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sudden it stalks seeds Resin leaves any
part of the plant whatsoever so that was
[SPEAKER_02]: two years ago for BC the judge decided it
was only for BC Guys like myself when I go
[SPEAKER_02]: back home to Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was unable to bring hash back there I
was only allowed to travel with herb and a
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer so when I leave to go to
Manitoba at the end of this month You're
[SPEAKER_02]: damn sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be bringing some extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different world same thing with me
traveling to Ontario It's home for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people that moved out to the West Coast
But at the same time Ontario is that East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast hub, and it's where you are gonna
get your head crack and It's funny that
[SPEAKER_01]: what we take is standard medicine I saw a
news article where it was like someone was
[SPEAKER_01]: caught with four grams of shatter This
stuff is potent man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it and it was made into give just
with it turned Right back into crack right
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I can see you know that person's
case being overturned that got arrested
[SPEAKER_01]: for it And the whole police division that
was kind of gearing up for on cracking
[SPEAKER_02]: heads on the subject matter having to let
it go It's a very important decision
[SPEAKER_02]: nonetheless the best analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever heard Kirk use was in the What
was the court case after the FET the first
[SPEAKER_02]: one and before the supreme there was three
judges and it was here That was our was it
[SPEAKER_02]: our provincial Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe that was our Provincial
Supreme Court so at that court case Kirk
[SPEAKER_02]: to saw said something absolutely brilliant
and it really I saw the sparkle in the
[SPEAKER_02]: judge's eye I'm sure it's where the
descent came from and I'm sure it's how he
[SPEAKER_02]: got to the Supreme Court And it's when he
mentioned that with under the current
[SPEAKER_02]: regime We are allowed to like an elder
elderly woman can acquire cannabis And
[SPEAKER_02]: it's legal for her to have that but if she
takes that cannabis and steeps it in a cup
[SPEAKER_02]: of tea She's now done an extraction and
she's now looking at Potentially a
[SPEAKER_02]: mandatory minimum of two years in prison
you she became a manufacturer just by
[SPEAKER_02]: simply Getting closer to her mess and
that's how they had it worded But in
[SPEAKER_02]: reality the judge didn't see that as her
becoming a manufacturer He saw that as a
[SPEAKER_02]: flawed law that was written in a way that
had to be changed and so that change has
[SPEAKER_02]: come we are now able to use extracts right
across the board in Canada and
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's really only for the
40,000 patients under The MM a our program
[SPEAKER_02]: and I suppose it'll be covered the MMP our
patients, but right it doesn't give them
[SPEAKER_02]: access It doesn't give them access.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key right there the MMP our
patients can take their product and they
[SPEAKER_02]: can get Who knows who to make it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm legally allowed to
make it if ratios are we allowed to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lab and make products for people We don't
know right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're allowed to make them for ourselves
Horatio obviously goes out of his way and
[SPEAKER_02]: makes them for people because he believes
that you know Helping people that are sick
[SPEAKER_02]: is the right thing to do and I sort of I
stand behind him that firmly But at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time we have families We have wives
and we have children and we have things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we need to protect while we're doing
this sort of good work Yeah, it's it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean even congratulations all the MMP
our people who Some of them pay the price
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them use it to engage with
dispensary So currently that's the only
[SPEAKER_01]: model where dispensaries are available
that MMP our people have been able to Find
[SPEAKER_01]: access but again that access is
technically legal still because there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: such thing as a designated process or any
other type of term like that and We don't
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly have that type of back-and-forth
infrastructure, but for somebody in
[SPEAKER_01]: Manitoba You can always get online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's time to order yourself a bubble
bag kit you can start to convert your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff up, but on a scale that actually
deals with You could almost say type 1
[SPEAKER_01]: patients patients who are either
physically unable to Actively do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: stir a bag dry sip whether it's the back
or spine or they're in a condition of such
[SPEAKER_01]: Terminality that they can barely ingest
something down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They require it to be made They're gonna
need help and eventually somebody it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like I see this happening all over again
with somebody reaching out getting caught
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we end up in a challenge when it
comes to the right to produce for someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else because of that same Eventually the
government become aware of the unique
[SPEAKER_01]: talents that Some of those unique talents
are sitting right here at this table right
[SPEAKER_02]: now One of the things I wanted to mention
while Horatio was talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to make your own hash Bubble bags
is going to be offering a 25% discount to
[SPEAKER_02]: all MMA are and MMP are patients that
would like to Get into water extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to a bubble bag comm you can
use the code health Canada That'll be the
[SPEAKER_02]: code for the 25% discount off of bubble
bag kits and machines, so we're always
[SPEAKER_02]: down with giving discounts are to The
medical community all right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to start the commemoration of
extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with an extraction of Our main
ingredient THC a so we're going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: with the main ingredient Horatio has done
a fine extraction here Done some pure THC
[SPEAKER_02]: a That's a THC acid it has not been heated
so this is the Carboxylic acid ring still
[SPEAKER_02]: intact, and it's very very very white And
I'm guessing has pretty much no no odor
[SPEAKER_01]: give it a go and see where we're at That's
kind of why I said last time I'm not high
[SPEAKER_01]: purity, but I'm not going around thumping
on any chest But pretty close to odorless.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the tiniest little bit of that
mercy
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just funny because I've seen so many
people that all we've got here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll show me 98% and it's still
yellow It's still got discoloration,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it seems as you get closer and closer
1% I mean I know this is a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: notches brighter than the previous
incarnation So long the next question is
[SPEAKER_01]: how much stronger is it if you keep
removing?
[SPEAKER_01]: The contaminant in the adults All right,
so okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to hear that hit that off of
the?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sapphire insert on the shelf or do you
want to go right into the silicon carbide
[SPEAKER_01]: dish well in this case um it's not really
like we're going for flavor here and One
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I noticed and it was a definite
notice is remember how we made that
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdote about it It kind of having a slow
kind of standardized melt to it it got
[SPEAKER_01]: even slower With on that subtlety on
refined out so I've actually been heating
[SPEAKER_01]: it hotter else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find I can't finish and what temperature
are you thinking um on my own nail?
[SPEAKER_01]: I look to the 400 Celsius, so I have a
feeling if it's set for sip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already good to go It's at about 680
Fahrenheit right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's um that should be fine Did
you want to go direct into the silicone or
[SPEAKER_02]: put the sapphire additional because it
doesn't matter to me I don't mind going
[SPEAKER_02]: direct onto the silicone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of want to see it yeah,
but um yeah with that you're up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardest thing is the balance
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting I Found it um I mean I'll find
out now because we're sitting in the sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not as bland as historically
described I guess maybe they took sativas
[SPEAKER_01]: for granted, but down in BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get many upward rushes that aren't
It's completely invisible on the nail like
[SPEAKER_02]: completely invisible That was interesting
hard to explain almost no taste whatsoever
[SPEAKER_02]: Effects are absolutely there, but they are
very one-dimensional You know as I sit
[SPEAKER_02]: here at And feel the effects kind of
slowly curl up behind my eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel the effects a little bit of my
body I definitely feel like I couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: probably get too too focused on hitting
pure THC all the time might have a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific range for something well the
thing about it is it's an amendment it is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically in a way to rev it up because
now let's say we jump over and take a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: of some sour diesel How will that
basically?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing these terms to the THC in
our system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all in there because we know we got
basically you never know what the THC was
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetically grown to the potential of the
turps, so I'm throwing a little rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa behind it it might give it the
final amount of gas it needs but And how
[SPEAKER_02]: was this made um that's rosin Oh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosin from dry sift just a little rosin
from dry so you know you know how it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin from dry sift That's who I am I
don't have the spare bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the spare sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like potent stuff So yeah,
let's put that's kind of why everyone goes
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make these super high I'm like
well you still need a turp either in your
[SPEAKER_01]: system before or after But that whole
recipe I mean my analogy is always the
[SPEAKER_01]: turps to the directions some directions
can take you nowhere Some directions can
[SPEAKER_01]: take you around the world, but the THC is
the gas And we don't always have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: gas to get to amazing directions it smells
amazing But it didn't produce that punch
[SPEAKER_01]: all those directions all the sense an
amazing trip, and it doesn't yield the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual high So I'm looking at ways to
pretty much bring every strain to its full
[SPEAKER_01]: potential the only thing I can't do is
make more turps Right, but I can't bring
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you the pure THC a is very
Almost just like I said one-dimensional
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy it sort of could almost get you just
staring and I love the effects in the past
[SPEAKER_02]: when we've taken the terpenes and
modulated that THC and really felt the
[SPEAKER_02]: uplifting effects of almost like the
feeling of smelling a flower or squeezing
[SPEAKER_02]: some mint and smelling some mint David
Malmo Levine in the house here guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I plug my new book?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free copies for all pod activists and
otherwise it's eight bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the answer to the question is
cannabis inherently harm young people's
[SPEAKER_00]: developing minds the answer the short
answer is No, one of the reasons I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that is because when I came to BC I came
from London and like everyone I had an
[SPEAKER_01]: internal instinct to I moved to Burnaby
Mountain and walked Hastings all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to here and I owe you sir for some of the
more life-changing experiences of my life
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you, and what you provided at
the Herb School during that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Herb School was legit Upper level next
level shit it paid a critical Point in
[SPEAKER_01]: many people's developments who you're
looking at one of them today I had some
[SPEAKER_01]: unique psychedelic trips that I would
never have safe access to anything like it
[SPEAKER_01]: in any way I could trust that Changed my
life in significant ways that your
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms play a major role in We had some
fine fungi there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good positivity there.
[SPEAKER_02]: See that's how it goes I remember the Herb
School back in the day and I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, what was the place that you opened
after the Herb School where you were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling Burnaby operation was back in 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was yeah, that was That was
called the Dutch Embassy flower and tea
[SPEAKER_00]: room because we figured well We're gonna
get arrested might have a funny name and
[SPEAKER_00]: one that makes people think at the same
time Dutch Embassy kind of you've always
[SPEAKER_02]: got great names I only just recently
before the accident at your spot I have
[SPEAKER_02]: someone told me that you open this place
called stressed In the back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective on what a dispensary or what a
Place that yeah medicine is medicine can
[SPEAKER_00]: also be for the relatively healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the stress I Drove I remember I
drove box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw them I'll tell you what they
can be dedicated to clean high-quality
[SPEAKER_02]: dried cannabis best cash in Vancouver
clean concentrate safe edibles Books and
[SPEAKER_02]: pamphlets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like I'm gonna have to go and do
a little Review on the stress that the
[SPEAKER_00]: press here love for you to check out our
entire menu With the close visual and even
[SPEAKER_00]: empirical inspection We were actually just
talking about the wonderful news in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith case Oh Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a win at the Supreme finally the
supreme say yes to kind of a pot This is
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest federal level acceptance of
medical marijuana In Canada, it says Are
[SPEAKER_01]: there any other federal levels that have
actually acknowledged extracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, are they coming to the terms?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think yeah, you're great doesn't
know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're great either hasn't dealt with us
extracts or hasn't Legalized extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, it is definitely pioneering work
and I've got to give a tip of the hat to
[SPEAKER_00]: mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two saw two saw two saw lock as he came up
with the win and that's All the matters he
[SPEAKER_02]: came up with the win and not only that I
congratulate you first for going on the TV
[SPEAKER_02]: there and having to talk with that woman
who was a fairly intense woman I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: you did great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Daniel Larson did great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought Kirk Slayed it Like that
when he everything he said about because
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was important to hear from a
perspective of that person on the TV
[SPEAKER_02]: wearing a suit intellectual Articulate on
point and just saying it how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for Canadians This is our guy just
watching that that defined our whole
[SPEAKER_01]: movement and what we've been dealing with
and fighting against That woman and that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of mentality the policy she can
create and the City Hall hearings We've
[SPEAKER_00]: had some really talented presenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Kirk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Hillary Black.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Dana Larson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my thing Neil Magnuson Knocked it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked him more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked me and Riel Kapler is up first

Compassion Club for a long time quite
[SPEAKER_02]: quite quite the early days that real came

[SPEAKER_02]: it was definitely the first four or five
years that I remember her showing up and
[SPEAKER_02]: coming onto the scene and it was great to
have her just show up and another really
[SPEAKER_02]: smart intelligent Articulate person that
can sort of push this forward motion on to
[SPEAKER_02]: this Yeah, just legitimize this subject
that we've been screaming at the wall for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's Other people, you know spend a

[SPEAKER_00]: It's open 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: To 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out our website stressed in the
press.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located one block West night street
on one One three five three East 41st at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cullinan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what does it say used tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it say East night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next well we had to yeah,

[SPEAKER_00]: for the For the City Hall meeting,
but yeah, the next one will say West
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Dave much appreciate I can remember
way back in like 96 97 You know Knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these guys Dana and Mark and David
and Chris Bennett and yeah, just it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time that we've been actively
Promoting this agenda here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long scene with a lot of different
characters changing Absolutely,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave was a frontliner.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a He's never been afraid to get
arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always really been Just like Horatio
said like he definitely deserves that sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of level commands a level of respect over
the years from what he's done and for the
[SPEAKER_02]: way he's held his you know put himself
right on the front lines and often to
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out other ways to sell herb get
herb to the people, you know Like the
[SPEAKER_02]: minute I saw the name stressed and
depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought that's something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not just your average That's that's
not recreational that's that's for needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember when we was called
stressed because that's what you used it
[SPEAKER_01]: for and Then there was weed that was
stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great hit on that sour diesel
That's kind of why I feel like when you
[SPEAKER_01]: pair it with more THC back-to-back It
creates more so of the experience than
[SPEAKER_01]: typical So it's really something you
shouldn't need a lot of to take strains
[SPEAKER_01]: further and further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hit it again and then like then hit the
THC and see if the brush is still
[SPEAKER_01]: one-dimensional or if it's more like the
sour diesel I'm gonna throw the sapphire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the sapphire on the There's a little
shelf here that this thing goes on if I
[SPEAKER_02]: can get it on without burning myself There
we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should look you know what a nice
cold sapphire hit might be unique as well
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well not a little attempt do it up inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I'm saying, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're getting another one of those
stretches So, yeah, we're just on the
[SPEAKER_02]: second floor here of the cannabis culture
Daper lounge Jeremiah and Jody Emory are
[SPEAKER_02]: in the other room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're setting up for Jeremiah's show on
pot TV, which is the The pot TV news,
[SPEAKER_02]: correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for four o'clock or 20 or 20 even
yeah, you can check it out on pot TV on
[SPEAKER_02]: their YouTube channel and We're just gonna
finish up here have a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation a little bit more bowls Maybe
get some of this so now combine it with
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if you experience it as sour
diesel or as flat Because you've got those
[SPEAKER_01]: turps actively in your Because
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to do I do a small hit and then
I'll hold it in for the full duration And
[SPEAKER_01]: let it come my system Because there's
nothing pretty very little contaminant and
[SPEAKER_01]: you get away with Almost because it's so
smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn that's why I turn the heat up and I
kind of take it all in and I just hold it
[SPEAKER_01]: and It seems to well, where do you feel do
you feel it more like?
[SPEAKER_02]: The sour diesel but something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even express it's different
throttle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah It's throttle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely behind my eyes and a sort
of a More of an it's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though I didn't take added turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really feels like it was kind of this
Like a dry hit like it seized a bit but
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of where back-to-back hits are
interesting because you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: back-to-back hitting it, but I It seems to
do more For because it's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not adding anything new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's just THC, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to this sour diesel experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the mercy in the sour diesel is the
limiting that I Like it when I have
[SPEAKER_01]: something to pair it's no fun on its own
because it's like driving as fast you can
[SPEAKER_01]: straight I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be hitting it all day long like
that I would get it either with a variety
[SPEAKER_02]: of terpenes or even safer and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like Has a terpene profile I that's I
actually I prefer it to rev up every
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that's kind of where it's like I
have it on deck and I go through what I
[SPEAKER_01]: have it's not it's not something to smoke
on its own unless I guess this is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: where I wonder from a pain standpoint is
This refried beans in comparison to this
[SPEAKER_01]: and is that why it hits you harder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if these two hits should be
technically the same the only thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: this is double activated Yeah,
because it's active and then we double
[SPEAKER_01]: activated refried beans is different than
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we refried beans that give you gas or
don't I don't like I mean that from a Good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly there's a reason for refried
beans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get actually ferments it and people seem
to go that way But I look at these two and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like this should be like an on-the-go
hit of this But it seems to be like this
[SPEAKER_01]: is this this is the narrow leaf drug
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the broadleaf cultivar from the
same Well, this is something strict and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is something that comes with a
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean this is Turpenes are in there
cannabinoids are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well In the end its goal is to have as
least amount of Turpenes as possible Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean that's kind of what standardizes
it if I get Turpenes in there then then we
[SPEAKER_01]: got sour diesel in it Yeah, that's that's
what takes it out of the nutraceutical But
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the one term thanks to last week's
hash church that I really enjoy is the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that these are components in the
cannabinopathic library of medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lester Yeah, Lester.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabinopathic library.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that Because I mean this is a
prescription this is a prescription that
[SPEAKER_01]: is a balanced prescription of limonene,
mercy and what makes it sour diesel and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them but These base prescriptions
seem to be the ones that are most needed
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're the quickest to
standardize I can make this in this and
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know I was once a patient of this
store in an average person then um There's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be access for a few and in our
country on there's access in America But
[SPEAKER_01]: these are whole packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the grower did to it
It's still it still contains more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: variables because we're not at
professional growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if I factored these out It's not a
full cornucopia of medicines that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel sour diesel, but um This is
the antidepressant and this is the pain
[SPEAKER_01]: management Even though they're one
dimension like I'm very happy because this
[SPEAKER_01]: is something This is something we could
literally start making articles and trials
[SPEAKER_01]: and you try it you try it Are you all
finding it antidepressant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then THC has definite therapeutic
value outside of the antidepressant
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene, which is limonene and How can we
use it because clearly setifex and those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys tried something they thought they
could just simulate this and it would do
[SPEAKER_02]: the trick Well, I think that they might
have not had a close enough connection to
[SPEAKER_02]: the puffers It is an important factor that
and I was just talking to marijuana man in
[SPEAKER_02]: the other room and he mentioned it we can
go talk To him about this afterwards just
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's this connection with you know
in the new Rules and how they are now
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna allow extracts He said they kind of
made a point on saying that because
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking is bad and he said it is bad And
and so what marijuana man is saying well,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's what got us here It was
literally all these years of the smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: that led us to learning and the knowledge
came via that process of smoking He also
[SPEAKER_02]: told me a story of going and getting his
lungs tested and the doctor asking him if
[SPEAKER_02]: he was a swimmer because he couldn't
believe the hell that his lungs were in
[SPEAKER_02]: even though he admitted that he was a
smoker So it's an interesting factor That
[SPEAKER_02]: you can smoke to cough up bad things Yeah,
that's the whole process of an expectorant
[SPEAKER_02]: and opening up those particular areas of
the lungs to bring in oxygen Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're actually carrying weight that you
didn't know because you were so each
[SPEAKER_01]: breath was slowly accumulating crap You
don't even know how you got there Then you
[SPEAKER_01]: cough it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I been living this way for all these
years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this baggage in my lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes yeah smoking is the
expectorant you need Even in when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a cold to cough it up and get that
bacteria out rather than holding on to it
[SPEAKER_01]: So it develops in your lungs Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe we'll end up having a quick
talk with marijuana man I'll see if Jody
[SPEAKER_02]: and Jeremiah want to come in and throw
their five two cents down in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Horatio's out and Johnny B's
in just like that Johnny B bought some
[SPEAKER_02]: some of this fresh frozen rosin that looks
clear yellowish and We were just talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about sometimes when you make the rosin
with some fresh frozen with there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of water in there Be careful
because sometimes when you drop the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: onto the nail It can spurt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my shades on just in case I don't
mind putting on shades to have a little
[SPEAKER_02]: rip This is Medi you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in the freezer for I don't know
since last October.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even have to go like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a schmear thing Alright, here we go
hitting it on the sapphire with the
[SPEAKER_03]: silicon carbide dish Look at the sizzle
holy shit So that was my other thing
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've made this actually in several
different ways I made it with dry sips,
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it with bubble, I made it with just
bud and then I made it with fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_03]: and Just after squishing it the flavor is
just so much more intense and that's why I
[SPEAKER_03]: was just kind of curious Maybe that water
is protecting those turcos of squishing it
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit Well, no, it's because you
put you're using fresh material that
[SPEAKER_02]: hasn't been dried So it has more preserve
You haven't dried up those turpenes you're
[SPEAKER_02]: capturing turpenes I'll tell you that
sizzle like crazy So I made this this
[SPEAKER_02]: morning Oh, congratulations on the Owen
Smith case by the way hashish all around

[SPEAKER_02]: bit Which one's this quite a bit darker
