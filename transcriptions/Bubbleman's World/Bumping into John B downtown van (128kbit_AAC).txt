[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I caught up with this guy here in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when it's just like cruising
around, I'm like, dude, what are you
[SPEAKER_03]: doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, Joey's.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just went and ate some super delicious
food over at Joey's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Place is killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had a really nice meal, some nice food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice appetizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course now, it's time for us to
have a puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got the little hit, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a water bottle, but it's empty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's water.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is water over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go get water.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do everything over there now,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to come back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, we'll come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to puff hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have water.
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done the dry pipe a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, on those smaller pipes,
hitting it dry like that's very lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a crow drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he doesn't die in the next 30 seconds,
we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need a little mouthful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks clean to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we're drinking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not drinking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would puff here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you can see, where there's like,
it's like we're at the Green Lush
[SPEAKER_02]: Conference, and it's the day after,
and this guy's around in suits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a bike cop over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Vancouver, but hey, we've got a
beautiful truck sitting right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get in your place to be,
but in your truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's get in that truck now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a little bit of water for the
Hitman.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we need is a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I support my local Vancouverites when I
come here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy water that supports Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Support your community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a bad thing at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a tiny little bit of that 90
micron that we made a couple of days ago
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure if it will focus on that,
but I'll show you guys with a photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I prepare, I'm looking for the
torch to rip for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, these little pipes and torches have
turned to be quite useful at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I sure wish there was more
of an easier way using that plus and minus
[SPEAKER_04]: battery style to just heat it up,
not use the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the electric nail style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we ever get a plug into the cigarette
adapter one, we know that's something you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking about, you know, a little bit of
an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little battery pack portable D-nail unit
that hooks up to the little Hitman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, great for camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait till we're out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be happening soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: One for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little rip of that Astro Boy 90
micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some supreme full mount we made the other
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny sitting here and just watching
car after car after car.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost have to see this one because
it's, what is that, like a ridiculous
[SPEAKER_04]: Ferrari?
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in the financial district.
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier, John almost got hit by a,
what was that, a Maserati?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maserati.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about how it would have
hurt really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have hit me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just because it was so low.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be hit by that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely, you know, I was going to
heat it up for you, but the torch is in
[SPEAKER_03]: the wrong spot and I'm not going to grab
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not the best idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, you know, had a great meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little bit of meeting today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went down and did some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a stuff sent in to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff's in ships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The order got packed up and sent out for
champs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: For all those people out there that want
medtainers or bubble bags or bubble boxes,
[SPEAKER_04]: tumble nows, dry sifting screens and all
of the above, hash making tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would only suggest that in a truck like
this, when you heat it, you don't point it
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You point it like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you, we'll do it next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just cause that's how you set your wallet
on fire that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was quite correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did torch my wallet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let, lit, not let, lit up a few twenties
on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a nice little Chapman walking by
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave us the look over.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave us the nod, the okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another young lady coming up here with a
big smile on her face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, that's what matters,
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells so good too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you brought me some things,
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should go over some of the things
you brought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were considering getting a new timer
because the one that I lent you,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one my personal one, is old and well,
it's now got an error.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes sense because it's not
warrantied anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means I bought it years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what'd you get us here, bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got the CG, the XGC-1E cap
controller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be able to control
your exhaust fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the temperature gets too high,
exhaust out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you want to introduce CO2 to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have a two-light timer on this
side here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also controls the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's got a temperature control for the
top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, it's quite a goody
little unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did have one for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, zap strapping it to the sides
right here, like we always do,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we showed in the last video.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to go the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flame defender above it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug your lights in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy style for the timer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Timer's no digital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to run the pump, because you
can put this on a pump, it runs the pumps
[SPEAKER_03]: for basically a soil assistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have hydroponic systems for flood
and drain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a great little unit that I think
is going to work very well for Stoke,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I woke up today and went down to my second
tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the timer had a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was shouting out a warning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I figured I'd go into the city,
bump into John, reconnect from my Medi One
[SPEAKER_04]: connect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need my Medi One.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need your Medi One.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again for a nice big ass bottle
of Medi One.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does the job perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the coolest thing is,
Mark calls me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm driving down the freeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing isn't working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, dude, I'm just driving down the
freeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I pulled into Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right up, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: PNW walk into the main store there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Abby's right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, OK, dude, this is what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, we'll hook you up with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Justin's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, well, I'm going to give him
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Total hookup on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone took good care of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like done deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, within two hours,
bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Home delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within two hours, we have lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, actually, we should say,
this is dinner time now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was 730.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful sunny outside there right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going to go catch the last
little bit of sunset back at my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's headed in the other direction to go
home and take care of his plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we wanted to say what's up and have a
little puff with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show them the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show them the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as always, fucking pleasure,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to you guys, thanks for watching.
Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
See you next time.
