[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Sage!
[SPEAKER_01]: I made it!
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, look at that!
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I tumbled now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing going right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I tumbled, uh...
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tumbled a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so you tumbled about 20 ounces?
[SPEAKER_00]: About that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was... It's all trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, I've got this machine called
the Mean Green Trimming Machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's meant for trimming dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hang the material, and then I trim it
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, it's all the trim that
I've been saving up for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, you know, it's not pure
bud, but it's really nice leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it looks like there's some heddies
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got to clean them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Sage approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Porvos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just drop that right in the moat of
the nail there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right, not in the middle of the
hole, but the moat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the thing around the center
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing around the center hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just hold it there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just drop it right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll melt, and then take your hit right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, take your hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just sort of hold that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move it around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, you're getting... And
suck, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Sage knows how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to be dabbing out with people
that have never hit the D nail,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just kind of letting people... Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Dave was saying that he didn't
really understand when I put this in his
[SPEAKER_01]: head, and he was kind of like... Because I
just showed him the bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has bone dry powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not... It doesn't look like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was just mentioning that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to take a dab on that
note.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Garden Sage has asked, this bubble
here just became that gooey little disc
[SPEAKER_01]: that you had that was actually stuck on
this lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just with our fingers, we're going to
turn that into what we just had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the body heat alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm giving it pretty good pressure
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most beautiful gooey stuff
I've ever freaking seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we all love about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is truly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I laugh at this whole Health
Canada thing when they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, you can't have derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, listen, then don't call it
derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just figure out that this is marijuana,
if that's what you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what the medicine is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to call it the unadulterated
cannabinoid high.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really see cannabis laid out
that nice, that often.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to store it for a long
time, you might as well though,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it doesn't have to be handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the care, just the care and attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they pile firewood so they can
breathe, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not do the same with cloth course?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, no, listen, you're talking to the
choir here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love what you've done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see that kind of care,
it just translates to, it's clear that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have shown care throughout the
entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right down to this end, right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gummy resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready for me to rock?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab a do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, nice to have you here, David.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to you too, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the garden sage is doing here is
he is looking at three grades of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first screen, which was this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it looked like is one he's looking at
right now, which was, oh no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This red one on the far left was the one I
cleaned from this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this one I cleaned from this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was eventually in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these were in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took first this out and then out of
this, I took this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the difference with the
microscope, can't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a little off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you say is the difference in
the contamination levels of this first
[SPEAKER_01]: one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Although when you first looked at it,
you did think it looked beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's glandular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a sense, it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still heads that are smaller than
70 microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got 69 down to 25 micron in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I look at it, there's a lot
of the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've looked at the good one now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I only ever showed you this one,
you could leave here thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: this guy just showed me the most
beautiful, amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's neat that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a little dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're going to try and put
some, actually, if you want to maybe scoop
[SPEAKER_01]: a little onto this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to push some on with the other
one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pass this over your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to try to put your hat on
backwards so it doesn't steal the light
[SPEAKER_01]: off the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it doesn't want to drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been nice to watch it bubble
and melt, but it denied us.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it taste on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a vapor, like vaporization.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sift goodness.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's sublime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of a single screen sift here
from the tumble now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can get this clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the dry sift that was in the
tumble now.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ones are basically all top screens
that have been cleaned at separate times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one here is the 90, I'd say about
95% gland heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show some macro photographs of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It melts and bubbles into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite happy with that, eh, Garden Sage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
