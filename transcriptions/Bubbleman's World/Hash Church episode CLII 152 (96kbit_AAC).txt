[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, welcome, welcome to Bubble Man's
World and welcome to Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_07]: episode 152, if you can believe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get the links sent out here
real quick and we'll have the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a chill show today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really organized any big events
or people, just going to invite some of
[SPEAKER_07]: the regulars and some of the people that
are starting to become regulars in and see
[SPEAKER_07]: if they don't want to come hang out for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you guys are all doing well in chat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to start off by wishing mama,
mama, I want to wish mama a happy birthday
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as J Spontanele.
[SPEAKER_07]: They both have birthdays today,
so we got to say happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up to 70s mama and to J Spontanele?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we should start it with a rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: What say ye?
[SPEAKER_07]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing as I'm all alone in the Hash Church
here, I say we start it with a rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Etienne will probably be in here in
the near future.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've sent out the links to the email as
well as to the Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess all there is really to do is wait
and have a puff celebrating the birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I squished a little cookies and cream
yesterday from Concentrated X sent me a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit of nugget and usually I just
give the nugget away to people who
[SPEAKER_07]: actually smoke nugget.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this time I decided to press me a
little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting it for a little happy birthday
celebration for 70s mama, one of our
[SPEAKER_07]: wonderful moderators in the chat room
who's in there right now as well as J
[SPEAKER_07]: Spontanele.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have a puff.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have a puff for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine's next week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So salute.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be puffing with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: My son's is also next week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe my son's birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is like next, like a week tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's on the 27th.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on the 28th.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, are we ready to fake the wake?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're late.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm late.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I want to give a shout out to all our
brothers and sisters in Barcelona that
[SPEAKER_08]: were affected by this unfortunate tragedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all have been in travel.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, bubble man, you and I remed
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Barcelona there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So nothing but love and support to
everybody there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry that anybody was hurt,
much less killed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we send our loves and all that plus
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I shouted to Barcelona out on my wake and
bake the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a lot of good friends living there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while they got right freaked out by
this attack, there was multiple attacks,
[SPEAKER_07]: stabbings and shootings and people driving
over people with cars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just terrible, terrible shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes to show that the world is in pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe the next time you interact with
someone that seems like they're in pain,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe instead of flipping out on them and
getting into an argument with them,
[SPEAKER_07]: you could share a little positivity with
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, welcome, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give him a hug.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give him a hug.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at that vibration of that vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: You feel that energy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you feel that negative energy walk
by, give it a hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: And bring that energy back up for that
person because that all it needs is that
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit of a hey and some people that
just brightens their day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning to all you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we had recently here in Vancouver,
we had I guess a right wing group was
[SPEAKER_07]: going to do some hate speech thing that
they were applying for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so people were like, let's go down to
City Hall and protest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And well, Vancouver showed up in drones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I suspect there was four or 5000 people
that showed up for this little protest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just good to see that some people
are going to maintain and keep things on
[SPEAKER_07]: track the way they need to be because it
seems like hate is really rooting itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not sure that it's actually
rooting itself as much as we are seeing it
[SPEAKER_07]: more.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're covering it more than ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what the news is sharing with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's tons of love going on out there
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know for a fact because well,
because I love my bong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here it is with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Johnny loves his bong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see him smiling.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love mine too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, they're gonna try and do that
next week in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no permit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But already, fortunately, some very
intelligent friends of mine are doing what
[SPEAKER_08]: they did in Germany, and are sponsoring a
Nazi to walk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for every mile the Nazi walks,
they're raising money for anti hate
[SPEAKER_08]: groups.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're raising money over on GoFundMe
for Berkeley Loves a Freak Show,
[SPEAKER_08]: an anti Nazi fundraiser fundraiser to end
hate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to, that's over on
GoFundMe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're just trying to use positivity
to, you know, to knock down some of this
[SPEAKER_08]: hate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know, no one's going to confront
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's going to get in their faces from
our group that is because, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: nothing good was going to come from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, they're raising money, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would you confront them?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, keep going, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy in Europe in Germany was paying
10 euros per mile walked.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're encouraging people to bring
bananas and other foods and fruits to keep
[SPEAKER_08]: them walking and moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're trying to also keep them
healthy on top of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're missing one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's just got to get a bong.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can't really do that outside in
California yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as somebody said there, we're just
going to kill them with love.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, meet the hate with nothing but
love, because that's what will overcome it
[SPEAKER_08]: always.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, D, if that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am all for love, peace and equality and
no fucking racism.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if any sons of bitches get in my face
or my family's face or friend's face or
[SPEAKER_04]: even a stranger's face that isn't fucking
proper, I'll get in their face.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got no problem doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's do orbital orbital lobe crushing
orbital bones since 1970.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was going to say 87 to be real.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Sam, how's it going over there in
Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairly sunny outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit cool, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's in the pipe, Sam?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's in the pipe?
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how you became a robot for me when
you said that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did anyone else catch that robot voice?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it slipped into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was wicked.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Tangee.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my very manly robot voice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, I went to patent that and
I noticed that you had already patented
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't can't get one up over on that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, puff, puff, puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bum rip, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bum rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't deny that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you puffing on there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Chilled Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you puffing on, Bubble Man?
[SPEAKER_08]: What you puffing on, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm puffing on the... I do First Bouncer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I sit here some day with you guys on House
Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the sift, and that's why I smoke it
only on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pardon me for coughing while you talk,
John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me mute my mic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought maybe I was cutting somebody
off.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you guys puffing on for Sunday
morning?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for me, I make it kind of
traditional.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I get on House Church, I pull up my
little container of First Bouncer,
[SPEAKER_10]: the nicest sift, and I share it with you
guys in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got my mix of about 500 varieties,
so I get my mix of my mash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wake and bake with cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I squished it on the M1 press.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do some squishing on the M1
press this morning, because A,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And why wouldn't I, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So was that cookies or cream did you start
with?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you started with the combination?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, it is the cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I want to ask a question about that
new one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot!
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, is that new one, is that for personal
product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like a nice Percy unit that we can
get, or is it still... I can't tell you
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck, I thought you were saying...
That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it's a personal unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet, when I look at it, I think,
man, you could really produce with this
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if you put someone to work on this
thing, the plates just open and close so
[SPEAKER_07]: nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get the foot pedal or even the hand
pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really nice... The boys sent me a
free hat and stickers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it on their Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, John, that's a nice hat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, you know, I got a thing in
the mail with a hat and some stickers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a picture on my Instagram just to
say thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they got their shit going on,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my press.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the V1 and V2.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to get one of those here
next.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to have a dozen of them actually
in a whole line of production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can collect them all.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like trading cards.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have almost all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny because Matt was up here and
he was like, he's like, I think you're
[SPEAKER_07]: missing the 2.5.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the 2.5.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, you got your V1.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your V2.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your M1 all in a row.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'm ready to swish some rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which coincidentally enough is what I need
to do to fill these cartridges up so I can
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those on the market yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those pens, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be released in the next
week on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're all pre-orders right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so people are pre-ordering.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can pre-order.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, let's see, uptech.net has
them for wholesale and retail,
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_07]: bubblemanbrand.com will have them full of
the terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll sell them at bubblebag.com,
empty and freshheadies.com as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pre-orders so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, they're going to go good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's how much research and development
you guys did on those.
[SPEAKER_07]: One year, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And more importantly than that,
yesterday when I was trying to get my
[SPEAKER_07]: daughter's bike out of my truck and I was
standing on the back of the truck with it
[SPEAKER_07]: in my pocket, that's why I now have it on
a lanyard, I leaned over and it fell like
[SPEAKER_07]: to the concrete.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a glass cartridge, by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just like, all right,
well, here's the big test.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was the, let's see if I can get
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't want to give me the, oh,
there's the dent right there, right in the
[SPEAKER_07]: top of the can.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see a little dent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, works perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't break, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember my trippy sticks breaking when
they fell over on the table.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it drove me insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have so many broken ones right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, John, this one's for you,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I've dropped it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've dropped it a hundred fucking times,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: One time out of the truck, only one time
out of the truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that shit was like, I was like,
okay, fucking thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Gary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have a broken 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send one to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sending one to you for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually what I'm doing is I'm sending
two to Soma with the Terps, get them to
[SPEAKER_07]: make up the Terp oil, get them to fill
them up and then bring you yours full.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to hook up with Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got one for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try not to break it until after it's
empty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Break it right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that way we can figure out what
one of the weaknesses is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I'm looking for critiques,
not like, you know, oh, it's this and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's so great.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, we want to find out what
we can make better right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it's obviously not the be all end
all pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the first generation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's version one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you can play with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause yeah, I am looking for myself
because I've given up on pens altogether,
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's just like all of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went on a trip a couple of years ago and
I started off with eight pens and day one,
[SPEAKER_08]: seven of them broke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, I literally drove, literally drove
to Flagstaff on the, the first heady smoke
[SPEAKER_08]: shop I could find and went and bought a
manual rig for the rest of the trip
[SPEAKER_08]: because I was just done with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I hate when shit doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love people and I have friends who
have made these, but the pen sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now that bubble man, which I love this
stuff as well as Omicron, which was the
[SPEAKER_08]: only pen that worked for me consistently,
but it's still kind of a messy to deal
[SPEAKER_08]: with.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm definitely looking forward to giving
this an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, this one gives a dab and it gives it
right to the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just probably took my last rep cause
it's pretty much empty and it tasted as
[SPEAKER_07]: good as the first rep and the battery
lasted the whole fucking like how,
[SPEAKER_07]: what a brilliant thing is like,
yeah, I designed the battery.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would last the whole cartridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing about these pens as well as
with my travel and the way I've done it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, I don't, you know, I don't like
smoking and driving and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stinks the truck up and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you get, you know, I'm exposed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get pulled over here, Oh,
it smells like weed in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're getting jacked up and fucked
around and printed your license out,
[SPEAKER_04]: proving this, proving that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the pens that I've taken on the trips,
they're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one apex.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, is you reload it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you keep reload reload and you leave
that apex in the pen over night in the cab
[SPEAKER_04]: of the truck overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it smells like you've been smoking a
joint in there because of the residue
[SPEAKER_04]: that's left on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still stinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even those ones were shitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the disposal, disposable throw
away ones, your, their disposable
[SPEAKER_04]: throwaways and the stuff that's usually in
them is really disposable throw away shit
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beaver turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beaver turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with being able to mix your
own, you know, you got the turps you can
[SPEAKER_04]: mix into with your rosin, the whole
spectrum of it right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're not smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't smell like roaches and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it sounds like it also maintains a
hell of a long charge too.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long have you gotten it to go there,
Bman?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with the lanyard on there,
I want to, that'll be perfect with the
[SPEAKER_04]: lanyard for my fishing out in the water
and everything flow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over 24 hours at 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like 36 or 37 hours that we were
just hitting the shit out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing, here's the thing, the pen
itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I love to give it props and
whatnot, but it's, it's a pen that's been
[SPEAKER_07]: made.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's just a pen that looked at
all the other pens and made it way better,
[SPEAKER_07]: made it better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like improved all these different
things that were bothering us,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, temperatures that could be
achieved.
[SPEAKER_07]: This pen can hit a low temp dab at 300.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you could literally hit it for three,
12 seconds and get it up to like,
[SPEAKER_07]: like a Johnny B thousand degree hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like those big hits.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will give, it will give clouds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will make you cough like you've never
coughed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing is, is that more importantly
than the pen itself, it's the terp oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like six drops of terpenes into
half a gram of rosin to create this
[SPEAKER_07]: viscous oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what you're really hitting for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: When Tony first told me, he's like,
dude, it tastes way better than your rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, well, dude, how could it
taste better than the rig?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, bro, the terpenes,
it's got more terpenes than anything
[SPEAKER_07]: you're smoking on your rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you hit it in the pen,
every hit you take coats your lips in the
[SPEAKER_07]: terp rib.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even five minutes later, you could lick
your lips and be like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's unreal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Truly blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a little nervous.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, don't, don't hit it so hard,
Mackie Clow.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't want to cough, don't hit the
three buttons in a row.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, one 12 second, another 12
second, another 12 second.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the three, the three presses that
is the JB.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Johnny B like 1200 degree rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: After this torches, man, they're just such
a headache.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got like four here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I finally got one to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go with the blazers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blazers make the best torches.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, yeah, they just work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played around with all the little
stuff, but it goes back to way back in the
[SPEAKER_08]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought a blazer torch at a Arnold
Schwarzenegger cigar place down in Los
[SPEAKER_08]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I still have that lighter and it still
works.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a Japanese company, B L A Z E R.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they make the finest, most consistent
working.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just keep it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: The good fuel in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll, they'll last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have torch problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we've all thrown them out the door,
out the window, or if you had them like
[SPEAKER_08]: light up on you or it almost explode on
you or the gas shoot out the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had that live.
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw the big flame.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's such a big, big flame,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the problem with the torch tubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I have a couple of torch tubes
and they're great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one time Todd and I were on our way to
the airport and I had the torch tube in
[SPEAKER_08]: the back of this limo on the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we hit a bump and the bump caused just
enough of a cause in the airflow that it
[SPEAKER_08]: still was shooting out of the gas was
shooting out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the flame was completely ensconced and
around because the vapor spread out and
[SPEAKER_08]: went basically around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I blew it out, turned it off, blew it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it finally went out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just, um, Jesus, one of those
moments where you're like, I was glad I
[SPEAKER_08]: was in artillery and know my safety
training and how to handle, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: intense situations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that could have ended up really bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it showed me again that, you know,
even though again, torch tubes are great
[SPEAKER_08]: inside of a, you know, uh, on,
on, on a safe surface, not in a car
[SPEAKER_08]: bouncing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I mean by torch to people is,
uh, they actually have a, uh, a gas
[SPEAKER_08]: chamber on an actual pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and there's an actual gas release
where you can actually fill it and release
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's all in one piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's actually a torch tube and a pipe
all in one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not talking about separately an actual
torch, um, altogether, but as you saw,
[SPEAKER_08]: it does happen with like Johnny B right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just saw a three foot flame that
shoots off there, which can be
[SPEAKER_08]: uncomfortable and disconcerting to people
around you, as you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not heating up the nail either.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the main concern right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone gave me a torch when I was last in
Toronto, it was, I think it was seven 10
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingston, the shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll definitely shout out the right
ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't Steve comes to mind,
it was a green blazer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when my friend Neil gave it to me
through this guy, he said, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, make sure it was actually John,
one of his business partner who said,
[SPEAKER_07]: listen, uh, when you fill up the torch,
you really have to let it settle for a
[SPEAKER_07]: while and let it, uh, let the butane go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's basically like something
about, and I think I mentioned it one
[SPEAKER_07]: time, but I got it wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone came on my YouTube and
explained it really beautifully.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember which, which episode or
what, what a comment it was, but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: basically like not filling the torch and
then using a little O ring on the inside
[SPEAKER_07]: of the torch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess it can do what Johnny's is
doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can also leak like consistently
leak.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're just using gas for no good
reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you put your, your gas in those
torches, definitely leave them for a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be hitting that shit right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And make sure when you're traveling,
make sure it's screwed off or empty is the
[SPEAKER_08]: best case.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a picture the other day of somebody
who had a gas leak inside a vehicle and
[SPEAKER_08]: somebody lit a cigarette and the car was,
uh, uh, unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, be aware of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do leak and things like blazers
actually have a red cap that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: actually put over the, uh, opening valve
so that that can't happen while you
[SPEAKER_08]: travel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So be aware and be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is explosive gas and it will harm you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will burn you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those torches are 2200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will scar you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For life.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can, uh, I can, it's about to say,
I think everybody's got to burn somewhere,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, a couple of little circular half
moons here, there always, always,
[SPEAKER_07]: always the most sensitive part of your
body, like inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your arm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like reaching across the dirty table.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's one right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just reaching across the table and
right on the inside there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get the dim sun table with the
wire, DNA water that goes down through the
[SPEAKER_07]: center.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can just roll that thing around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it out of my way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to reach battle scars, puff scars.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Puff scars.
[SPEAKER_03]: My last burn is from an electric nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not gas related at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just stupid related.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I've done that too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time I checked, man, remember hot
knives.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things used to scar the fuck out of
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to school with the perfect knife
mark on my chin at least five times or
[SPEAKER_08]: six.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you notice how the tips of your knives
always stay that tempered color.
[SPEAKER_08]: Never changed back, no matter how hard you
tried to polish it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never burnt my lip, but I had friends
that did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had one friend that passed out
unconscious on the stove, had like the
[SPEAKER_07]: bullseye on his chest.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was an ER visit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lip, that's just bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: But passing out on the stove, unconscious
and burning while your stone friends talk
[SPEAKER_07]: around the kitchen table with their backs
to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably the worst sort of hot
knife injury that you can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really the unconscious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe it could be worse if you had
a glass there and you cut yourself while
[SPEAKER_07]: you fell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you were burnt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you were making BHO and breathing
nitrous oxide and doing that all at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's stepping it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me guess you've patented that already.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you call it, Sam?
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, dude, that's the original Jeffrey that
they jacked from that movie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get him to the Greek on time.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the OG Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_07]: They stole that from Sam, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just stupidity or the stupidity?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to say, really.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chill hash church today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it was going to be no plans.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew Natasha was going to be away today
and I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just go with a real chill,
tell stories, have fun, laugh,
[SPEAKER_07]: shoot the shit with the boys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, wish a few people a happy
birthday and chat.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always nice when it's your birthday
episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say I was watching your
last little Roslyn Squish video there with
[SPEAKER_10]: the new one there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just on stuffing the bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: And folding the corners properly and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Little key tips that I forget about.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I went outside and looked at the
corner of my bag and went, damn,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's my name.
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowledge drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, knowledge drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great that Matt was just like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit of information in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys got to watch that last one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is my bike M1?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that cut's coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, it's definitely a good little
squisher.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like just those little.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I used the bag that I was
frustrated with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mind you, I don't have the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got this the new little thing that I
like because I like the two grand little
[SPEAKER_10]: presses myself every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: A good little squisher.
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like 10 percent more than what people are
getting generally in their highest ratios.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what John was talking about in that
little video, if you haven't seen it,
[SPEAKER_07]: was making sure the corners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are full here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just mute you for a second,
John, because it'll change the camera when
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to show it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the corners are squared.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he makes sure that herb packs into
those corners.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes when you're using really
nice, dense nugget, you really have to
[SPEAKER_07]: work the bud into those corners.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to break it up real small and get
the corners filled out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important because what happens is,
is the oil fills up those little empty
[SPEAKER_07]: spaces anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's empty spaces.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oil will sit on the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can press it off and get it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's it's not ideal, you know,
especially when you if you saw that first
[SPEAKER_07]: press, if you didn't see that first press.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I should play it for you right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's that it's worthy of a hash
church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, it was a good thing
because I looked at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first thing I did is I ran outside
and grabbed a little corners and I was
[SPEAKER_09]: like, OK, there you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's what you it's what we're
learning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is about the technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still new.
[SPEAKER_08]: So any information that we can spread or
make people aware of, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody wants their gusher, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody wants their oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So nobody wants to lose it inside their
squish bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: So any techniques or ways that they can
learn is only it makes a better mint for
[SPEAKER_08]: all because, you know, hey, even when I
went to Alaska a couple of weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: what was the guy doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: He made me fresh rosin while I was there
in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I couldn't have been happier,
which means, you know, people would think
[SPEAKER_08]: people are paying attention and they want
to know and they want to learn,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, what is the temperature of your
above plate?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the temperature of the below
plate?
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things are key situations for people
to know, because they also, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: as much information as they can get on
quality products so that they can run
[SPEAKER_08]: through and get a consistent product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's only once.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, watching the video here that
Mark's playing and you can just see how it
[SPEAKER_10]: starts gushing out the size.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, how do we go back?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's eight grams with percentages and just
even talking about the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that key thing was putting that squish
in that bottle after.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you notice you notice him using the
hand pump like how like three pumps got
[SPEAKER_07]: the plates closed and suddenly like this
right here would have been a great press
[SPEAKER_07]: if it just stopped right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is what what temperatures were you
using there on your plate?
[SPEAKER_07]: He was kicking around 200 degrees,
maybe hotter.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see when we pull back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could have been between two.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had them hotter than I thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people were like, oh, you can get rid
of those bubbles.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, no, I understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt was doing all the pressing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He owns the company.
[SPEAKER_07]: He built the press.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to watch him do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the flow on that right far right
piece there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boosing down the neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here was a unique thing about the where is
my bike?
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very turpinilini, very, you know,
almost narrow leaf drug cultivar ask.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just had such a beautiful taste and
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put in six drops of clementine terpenes
with a half a gram of this rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the rosin absolutely completely 100
percent absorbed and changed the terpene
[SPEAKER_07]: profile of the clementine to the where is
my bike profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we put this particular resin rosin
into the bubble man cartridge that we hit
[SPEAKER_07]: on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That pen lasted us almost two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I also wanted to say
when Etienne was talking about the
[SPEAKER_07]: importance of the variables and the
temperatures, when people ask,
[SPEAKER_07]: hey, what temperature did you what did you
hit?
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to understand that that's not
necessarily going to be the temperature
[SPEAKER_07]: that works for you because the moisture
content of your bud, the resin content,
[SPEAKER_07]: the density of the bud all of these little
variables change and make these sweet
[SPEAKER_07]: spots on a sliding scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I suggest to people with bubble
hash with everything, whether you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: learn how to properly sieve or whether you
want to learn how to properly make rosin
[SPEAKER_07]: from bud or hash, there's a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go too far and you can go not far
enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the middle for most of us is where
you're going to find that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for rosin, it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have 100 grams of bud or 10 grams
of bud, take like half a gram or a gram
[SPEAKER_07]: and press it at a hotter temperature and
see what your yield is because the hotter
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature will get out the majority of
the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be like, okay, and now I know
basically what the yield is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I went a little, I personally,
I've never tasted my rosin go too hot yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heated up rosin where it tastes
like burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have smoked other people's rosin that
tasted like that, but I myself at 200 and
[SPEAKER_07]: 210 degrees have not gone over the point
where I feel like it's ruined,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's easy enough to go low.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy enough to go high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Meet yourself somewhere in the middle
between yield and taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're measuring the temperature from a
built-in digital temperature gauge or is
[SPEAKER_03]: the temperature gauge on these machines
the temperature that it's trying to make
[SPEAKER_03]: it or is it the temperature it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on the PID.
[SPEAKER_07]: The omega PIDs that I have are extremely
accurate, like within 0.1.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most other PIDs are accurate within three
to five degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I was going to say is that
also too, I can remember in the old days,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we pressed a piece of hash and pressed
it hard enough, it got hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the act of pressing increases
temperature is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but what I'm saying is the
temperature doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're numbers on a box.
[SPEAKER_07]: What matters is your bioassay and whether
you like those numbers high or whether you
[SPEAKER_07]: like those numbers low.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the temperatures really are to me
really doesn't matter because it's my
[SPEAKER_07]: bioassay that matters.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that if I lower the numbers,
I can butter out the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It usually stays a little more tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I heat it up a little hotter,
you get the full yield, but you might lose
[SPEAKER_07]: some terpene content.
[SPEAKER_03]: With lower temperatures, do you need a
stronger squish?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a longer squish and a stronger
squish, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally, you have that 20-ton plate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people can press it on less,
but yeah, I like strong press.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I love Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even with pressing dry sift or hash or
flour, I found that when I'm pressing my
[SPEAKER_10]: sift or my hash, I'm doing a lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely, I'm not pressing as hard as
when I'm pressing flour because I'm trying
[SPEAKER_10]: to steam it on that point.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me, personally.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's all different temperatures,
like Mark's saying, depending on what
[SPEAKER_10]: you're trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about finding your sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's so different and everyone has
different materials.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll squish out at 200 degrees like that
car that wears my bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, the terpene profile is off the
charts because it absorbed the clementine
[SPEAKER_07]: profile afterwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: All we could taste was, where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet, I have people texting me telling me,
you're burning off half your terpene
[SPEAKER_07]: profile, maybe even more, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking, these guys are not using bud
of this quality with this level of
[SPEAKER_07]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're probably using buds that are like
1% or less terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because for them at 200 degrees,
truly, they don't have many terpenes left
[SPEAKER_07]: at the end of a press.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're using something that's more
like 3% to 4% terpenes, they hold their
[SPEAKER_07]: own all the way through without a shadow
of a doubt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's using different quality and
there's different levels to this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Having conversations on the internet about
it is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too bad we didn't have a testing
device that hooked up to all our computers
[SPEAKER_07]: and you could just put your little bud in
and then it tested it and then it was
[SPEAKER_07]: like, okay, you're in this room for this
conversation with these people that have
[SPEAKER_07]: the same level of resin terpenes profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you said, humidity and other things are
key factors depending on what you're
[SPEAKER_08]: squishing and when you're squishing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all key components and it's all
about how long did it take you to finally
[SPEAKER_08]: find your sweet spot?
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes some time as well to play with
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen people get frustrated because
they tried it once or twice, it didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: come out and they give up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Persistence is one of the keys.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also some varietals will not
squish.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found that out as well or it won't
squish very well at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, that's just the reality of
the situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 100% the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all got frustrated.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all got sore arms, sore shoulders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see a vaporizer where the
temperature starts low for taste and then
[SPEAKER_03]: within a few seconds goes up to a high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what my pen does.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what the pen is designed to
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does that right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right this second.
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts out at 300, goes up to 650,
goes up to 800.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes up to 1200.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep holding that button.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to get hotter and hotter
and hotter and hotter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that's a great idea because
first you get the taste and then on top of
[SPEAKER_03]: the taste, you get all the punch.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it from you, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was your idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put it in the pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have that patented and I'll be coming
and talking to you really soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really happy to hear somebody's done
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to finish off what Etienne was
saying, which was a very, very important
[SPEAKER_07]: part.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the most important knowledge drops
of this hash church.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, if you can listen, don't be
afraid to make the mistake to find the
[SPEAKER_07]: sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the value.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's afraid to make the mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: The mistakes are what you pay for the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a costly mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking valuable lesson.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to, and you're not necessarily
ruining anything, but it's okay to find
[SPEAKER_07]: your envelope where you don't go far
enough and you go too far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then pull it back and pull it back.
[SPEAKER_07]: In trying all of those different resins,
you may be surprised which one you like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You really may be surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, it's cool for every ... Go ahead,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That mistake makes you realize that when
you know how to do things the right way,
[SPEAKER_03]: you remember them.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you screw things up over and over and
over and over and you finally do it right,
[SPEAKER_03]: you remember how to do it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when I show people how to make
bubble, they'll have me come in and do
[SPEAKER_07]: consulting and make some water hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be like, all right, well,
just so you understand, we're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: start off with some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I paid you here to come here and make no
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, listen, dude, you will not get
your money's worth if I don't make
[SPEAKER_07]: mistakes with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show you some key mistakes
that people make.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't be too bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll still save the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be very, very important for you to
learn with other materials to find your
[SPEAKER_07]: sweet spot rather than assume it's a
fucking recipe that stays the same all the
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the nuance.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the value when you can understand
the changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't understand the changes,
make some fucking mistakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us here did not get where we are by
getting it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are like, how'd you get so good at
this?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I made way more fucking mistakes
than you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you want to be better than me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got about one hundred and fifty
thousand mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You better get on making and you will
surpass me.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's already young.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've made a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: People, there's making mistakes as we
speak, you know, in their 20s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, yeah, I'm inspired.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make some serious fucking
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my biggest mistakes were my greatest
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I would not ever change getting
busted at the roadblock with 16 pounds and
[SPEAKER_07]: six grand cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit was extremely like a huge
bummer.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a very valuable lesson that
that led me in a direction that really
[SPEAKER_07]: brought me here today where we are right
here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, smoke sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might I might be a bit of a sailor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be swearing and cursing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for anyone that's watching
Hashtag with their children.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do sometimes swear a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a bit of a we get excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about what we love.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're we're we're kind of fucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I know we didn't talk about it
being D's birthday tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Day Monday.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying, you know, he's he's he's
he's he's going to be turning a little bit
[SPEAKER_10]: older.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I think we should be doing one
for for all like we did for the first
[SPEAKER_10]: birthday guys for yesterday for today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Twenty nine years old, D.
[SPEAKER_10]: Twenty nine years old tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's just like rocking it there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's feeling pretty fantastic to see
Slayer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to metallic.
[SPEAKER_10]: He went to Slayer is kind of like we did
pre birthday parties for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: So so are you going to go take a fish to
Slayer now?
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw you hold the fish the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already went to Slayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I went and seen Slayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came through town here to stay the
night and I stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and seen him at the hotel and I had
all my pontoon boats three high in the
[SPEAKER_04]: back of my truck because I was the day
before and in the smoke, the smoke was
[SPEAKER_04]: just like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're floating down this river for
like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been doing a lot of fishing up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the the one guy, the VIP dude that
runs that stuff for the for the band,
[SPEAKER_04]: he wants to he's really liking those
fishing shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to get him up here to come
fishing or hunting because hunting season
[SPEAKER_04]: is open now and fishing and everything
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to take him out and show him a
good time because they've treated me
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty fucking good since I've met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a great time at the concert,
got one of the friends and family VIP
[SPEAKER_04]: pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And went side stage everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a bong rip on side stage with Lama
God playing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dude, that's my band there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something else, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see in the chat, everybody wishing me a
happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a bong rip, you mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, smoke to that little Congo rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my bowl for D for 20 K's fucking half
century, half century, half a century.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm right behind you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the half a century for D.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's to however old 70s mama is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's to J Spontanele and anyone else
that has birthdays today or tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Celebrate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Birthday, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got birthdays?
[SPEAKER_04]: You lovely Leos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking roar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, are you all going to get to watch the
eclipse there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it coming through your neck of the
woods?
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's happening everywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, is it just happening
on like the western?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the world's flat, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a disk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We only live on one side and it's upright
like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured it all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured it all out with math.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll show you later, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do a video on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's now Flat Earth Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now with more beaver turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now with more beaver turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a chill.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, I picked up that soil
balance that came in there for me last
[SPEAKER_10]: week, this week I should say.
[SPEAKER_10]: So of course with my few plants that are
outside and haven't really been looked
[SPEAKER_10]: after that well, just kind of getting them
ready.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got treated them and see how it goes and
take a look at the product and kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: interested to see the difference in what
they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be kind of cool over the next
three or four months to see how well the
[SPEAKER_10]: product, if it does affect the same strain
we always have been dealing with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: What strain are you going to be playing
with, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_10]: Medi-Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one that works.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was having problems eating like the
other day and my knees are really bad and
[SPEAKER_10]: just eat some and it works so well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Last night I got some chocolates that were
made with some same tank tripping
[SPEAKER_10]: profiles, tank TEC levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: And wow, it's just amazing how well it
works.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a really key thing that affects
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I need.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know what strains I use for that
wherever I go now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So because of those profiles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So speaking as we were earlier of trial
and error, being a patient and a patient
[SPEAKER_08]: that you are, I want you to give some
fucked up reality here.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long did it take you to find that
particular genetic that works for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've been using cannabis as
medicine for basically my whole life in a
[SPEAKER_10]: way, but I mean, at time of injury in 2005
when I fell, I then came across a strain
[SPEAKER_10]: about a year and a half, two years later,
and I really realized how it helped me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And over the years I tried several other
strains different ways, how to
[SPEAKER_10]: decarboxylate with edibles through and all
stuff between those others, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_10]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, in reality, honestly,
it's taken it's taken this long.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's taken 11, 12 years of me dealing with
my pain control because every day I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: realizing what benefits me more when how I
can use CBD in the morning and use this
[SPEAKER_10]: strain at night.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's always a learning lesson for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much saying that now I know
the profile that helps so good with my
[SPEAKER_10]: pain.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm starting to see that, you know,
anything over 400 milligrams of CBD really
[SPEAKER_10]: helps me with my knees.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that has to deal with neuropathy and
that has the spinal cord injury.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I see what works for me now and how
that's helping.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say you know the profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the cannabinoid and terpene
profile or just the cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm learning with the terpene
profile with myself because I know the
[SPEAKER_10]: peppery and the mercy, you know,
those types of strains work for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also like more of like anywhere from
three to 5% CBD from anywhere from to say
[SPEAKER_10]: 25 to 29%.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see those ratios that work for me quite
consistently.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Mark says, I like to hit things hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get things in that direction.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what works for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I've it's like I said,
I'm still learning every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one thing I'll learn what
dealing with my pain is something that you
[SPEAKER_10]: have to work on all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went off my amino acids for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm back on them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize how much they pay a key role
dealing when I'm eating cannabis to help
[SPEAKER_10]: with the safe passing blood brain barrier
with natural GABA and tyrosine and all the
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff that I take.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm always testing to see how it works
with my pain and how it gives me a better
[SPEAKER_10]: quality of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, the question is, is you're going
to keep learning every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what it takes?
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes the rest of your life to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you'll get used to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it works for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: My stuff doesn't go away like everybody
else and we deal with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I want you to point out is
that it takes time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the frustrations that patients
come to me and they expect since we have
[SPEAKER_08]: such this wide variety of what immediately
is going to work for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to back them off to that
constant reality that some of this may not
[SPEAKER_08]: even work for you at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to have to go through a
trial and error just because it's called
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't mean there's just one fail
swoop of marijuana and to make them aware
[SPEAKER_08]: of now they have to figure out what works
for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically what I'm talking about is
finding out your condition and then
[SPEAKER_08]: finding something that is beneficial for
you takes a deal of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, people expect because
of Western modern medicine that the pill
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take is going to have an
immediate effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: They expect that same thing with cannabis
and it can be true in some cases to most
[SPEAKER_08]: cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in some cases, it's not the case at
all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thirty three pharmaceutical drugs that
took a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: They changed my medication so many times
because they didn't know what was working
[SPEAKER_10]: for what was going on with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the doctors do to 90 percent
of the patients out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can always try this.
[SPEAKER_10]: They try so many because you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can find something that's going to
work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark did it with me with the terpenes when
those terpenes went underneath my nose
[SPEAKER_10]: after surgery.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that one terpene, what that did to me,
it put another thought in my brain how
[SPEAKER_10]: much that helps so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really like I say for patients,
you get a chance to start smelling all the
[SPEAKER_10]: different profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that one that lights up your brain is
the one that you want to look at and start
[SPEAKER_10]: taking a look at the teasers.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've seen CB levels or CBN levels or the
cannabinoid profiles to see now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you've got that terpene that's working
for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now start trying to dial in the
cannabinoids in a way.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess that's what I've been doing
over time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been seeing what works for me and
then developing the cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_10]: ratios that work for me throughout the
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Sam, you took it to a whole other
level for the rest of the world when you
[SPEAKER_08]: couldn't find what you wanted and you
created skunk amongst others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's pretty classical plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I wouldn't have done it,
then there would have been some other
[SPEAKER_03]: variety that would have been the first one
that was widely distributed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just happened to be there at the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: The happy accident, the lucky miracle mix,
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's really, really important
is, well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: For medical and recreational, it's a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for recreational, it's lots of THC
with the terpenes that you prefer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, that can be bred for,
just like cannabinoids can be bred for,
[SPEAKER_03]: either for or against.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the future, we will have varieties
that are so much higher in terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: content, because people really like these,
and they really do modify the effects and
[SPEAKER_03]: potentialize THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got to think, if you take a
cultivar that's like five and make a
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrate with it, that the level of
terpenes is going to be off the chart,
[SPEAKER_07]: probably higher than what we are even
putting in these pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, it used to be that one,
two percent was pretty normal,
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then people started noticing that there
were three, fours and five percents that
[SPEAKER_03]: were winning the Emerald Cup and events
like this, because high terpene content is
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently linked with winning of these
cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: People like the high terpene contents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are varieties that exist that
are as high as ten percent that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: created by man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normal breeding, but man bred,
not just found in nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as well as reflecting many of the
people in chat, just wanted to say thank
[SPEAKER_08]: you, Sam, for your creations over the
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, you still don't think you get
enough love for what you've done for the
[SPEAKER_08]: world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's becoming more and more
normalized for people in certain states.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in time, it will become more and more
normalized in other states and in other
[SPEAKER_08]: countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, you lay to groundwork,
be it the happy accident that it was and
[SPEAKER_08]: that it could have been somewhere else,
it wasn't somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened to be you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 75, there was no cannabis seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardly anybody knew how to make clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very few people were using artificial
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Few people were using fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in 75, there weren't that many people
using metal highlights, maybe a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the events that changed
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And made it unstoppable and completely
uncontrollable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I didn't realize until I was
doing it, I didn't realize that,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, cloning cannabis didn't really
start until the early 70s as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that's a key way of spreading
genetics that I mean, back when I was,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, definitely it's past the statute
of limitations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So back when I was pumping out five
thousand clones a week, I was realizing
[SPEAKER_08]: the amount of genetics that were going out
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started to think of who started this
originally, because back in the day it was
[SPEAKER_08]: only seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you didn't need to clone until you
had lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need to maintain your best
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: True story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, either you maintain them or lose
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've lost many, many genetics over
the years because they weren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_08]: maintained or happy accidents happen,
such as hermaphrodites or males happen to
[SPEAKER_08]: slip in somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And pollen and the next thing you know,
your crops changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's good to share your cuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to share your cuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to share your cuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can get them out there,
at least to a couple of people,
[SPEAKER_07]: have them get them out to a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not the worst thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everyone's worried.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep a clone easy for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they can pick up viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to be careful that you don't
have insect vectors or other problems
[SPEAKER_03]: which are spreading viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that can do is really reduce yield
and vigor of your clone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how does one look for that,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_08]: How does one know when that starts to
happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the companies up there by David
Davis in the wine industry was offering to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it for cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there is a bunch of viruses
which have been found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them are fairly free.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't cause economic damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other ones are quite economic causing
damage of.
[SPEAKER_06]: My phone's just going off here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I think some viruses are spread
by seed, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think if you grow from seed,
no, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some viruses can be spread by seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got two, three more hours to go here,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it takes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the 2017 High Times Cannabis Cup
Canada is just around the corner.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been some pretty big changes with
the changing of the whole cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they got WY Gene.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Y Uncle Gene or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know his name.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm probably saying it wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a few good artists.
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't even released the main app
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really filling up and changing.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've moved to Bender Village.
[SPEAKER_10]: Time out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you just trying to say Y Clef Gene?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Y Clef Gene.
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, wow, this came up so wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I even said Y Clef.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was taking a rip out of my pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of listening, but not really.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: W Clef.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I never said that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're fucking funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's looking pretty, pretty, pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know Johnny's not a music promoter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking WYCLEF.
[SPEAKER_10]: That fellow with the clef?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to listen to some of his
music.
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently he's huge, so that's pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much tickets are joining to get in the
door?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there judges tickets?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing judging?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was to go down there for the event,
and I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much what's going down there,
it's opening up on the Thursday from like
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: till midnight.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have the side stage,
the saloon stage, which is kind of a bone
[SPEAKER_10]: in the meditator stage that we've worked
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on Friday, it opens up at noon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, and it goes until midnight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with Saturday.
[SPEAKER_10]: And on Sunday, it's open from 9 until 9 p
.m., from 12 p.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: till 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be the WYCLEF gene.
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll be playing on the Sunday for the
awards.
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't announced the Saturday
headliner.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got music.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go to basically cannabiscup.com and
check out Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can scroll down.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole event schedule's there.
[SPEAKER_10]: How much the tickets will be.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they got all different for tickets for
super VIP weekend.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like $715.
[SPEAKER_10]: Full event pass is $183.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your event pass includes general admission
for Thursday till Sunday is like $333.
[SPEAKER_10]: It all goes down.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get VIP for just Friday and
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 100 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's entitled with those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do any judging?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you smoke anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring your own smoke?
[SPEAKER_10]: You bring your own smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have 120 judges' bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, everything is online.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just go there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have sun, no general admissions.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got camps.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think everything that you're going to
need is there now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like all the other high time cannabis
cups they have all over the world and
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really looking forward to doing
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not just like all the other
cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's how they're kind of treating
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just decided to make it a high times
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: What, three weeks before the event?
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple of weeks before the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that to me is a minor spider sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: My spider sense tingled a little bit when
I was asked about it because I like the...
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, I know high times bring... For me,
what they've always done is they've been
[SPEAKER_07]: able to bring an audience where if I'm
going to go do business, it's worthwhile
[SPEAKER_07]: for me to do business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know high times can bring the group.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that being said, that usually takes
them six plus months of advertising and
[SPEAKER_07]: promotion and magazines and videos and
social media postings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so three weeks to take over this BC
one just made me nervous.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you'll be there and you'll check it
out and give us an honest review.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you even enjoyed it last year,
although I did hear some one guy got
[SPEAKER_07]: punched in the face or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was like an alcohol cannabis mixture
thing going on that hopefully they figure
[SPEAKER_07]: out this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope for the best, but I won't be there
myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm... You'll be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got your stickers.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're there in spirit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now that high times has taken over,
there's been a lot of big different
[SPEAKER_10]: vendors have come in.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've opened up by extra 150 booths.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got people coming in from all over
Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been certain things have already
completely sold out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it has changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: High times comes with their whole
entourage.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like six months over two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Jamaican style thing where it's
like, hey, you guys want to run the ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember for CRD, hey, you guys want to
run the ganja area for the rebel salute
[SPEAKER_07]: concert.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, oh yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: When is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're not going to have time to
prepare for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'd be preparing this for probably
about a month now and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it'll definitely be the first one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll look forward to the year after that
and how things will actually progress with
[SPEAKER_10]: them having it on the, well, it's the
Grizzly Adams property there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's where they just had SunFest,
so it can definitely hold enough people.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the largest stage.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty good spot, full camping.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a really good time.
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody wants to come over for the
party, you're always safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're in cannabis, if you can make it,
make sure you bring a tent because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: camping.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no hotels.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like that, but they do have full
shower facilities, bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got some luxury camping involved to
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, you got this huge cannabis village.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, the event has changed quite a
bit in the last just 48 hours with the
[SPEAKER_10]: amount of people coming in, the new
vendors coming in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the tragically hip still playing?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what's going on with that
whole thing at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Zero, they were talks about that in the
beginning, but maybe that was just a
[SPEAKER_10]: laugh.
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't announced the main event yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be for Saturday.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're waiting on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some rumors of what's happening
and who's coming in, but everything's
[SPEAKER_10]: rumored right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: High time just holding that tight to the
chest and we'll hear about it sooner than
[SPEAKER_10]: later.
[SPEAKER_10]: What it does, that's why they moved their
vendors village because they anticipate
[SPEAKER_10]: it's going to pack the whole area where
the vendors village was last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: They anticipated such a big volume of
people coming on the Saturday that they
[SPEAKER_10]: moved the whole village out of the way for
the amount of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really preparing this.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a different security that makes
sure putting in for road and stuff like
[SPEAKER_10]: that for access.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get in.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been some pretty big changes and
some pretty good changes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're really looking forward to it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The High Times Cannabis Cup here in BC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much all the details you need right
there given to you by Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's a website you guys can go
check out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll let us know how it went afterwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure he posts a video on his YouTube
channel and tells everyone how great it
[SPEAKER_07]: is.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's great, I'm sure it will be.
[SPEAKER_07]: My spider sense though, I'm going to hold
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go to the Karma Cup,
support Sarah Sunday who's been doing her
[SPEAKER_07]: cup for four years straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the sort of strong Canadian
cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much smaller, no campings in the city.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only a couple of days, but still pretty
damn fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good gathering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still kind of rootsy like what you might
say, like what the cannabis cup was like
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 years ago where it's still a little bit
of a smaller event, but very, very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people gathered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good speakers, good booths and just a fun
kind of very different vibe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost the polar opposite of the camping
British Columbia experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like a city Toronto experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sarah will be a celebrity judge at the
High Times Cup and definitely Sarah's Cup
[SPEAKER_10]: is, like you said, it's definitely more
roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was quite an experience when I was out
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a really good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was good last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going back this year again for that
very reason just to rock it out again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it's as good as last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always hoping for the best with these
events.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't do as many of them anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am much more picky these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I miss like 80% of the events and
go to maybe 20% of the events.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Karma Cup is the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Google it rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's karmacup.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Karma Cup or karmacup.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is going on in the cannabis
world here in the upcoming?
[SPEAKER_07]: That one you're talking about is in like
six days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be heading over on Tuesday,
of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: The official opening is Thursday at 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be the opening of the pre-party,
they say.
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be no Dennis Village open.
[SPEAKER_10]: On Thursday and then on Friday,
of course, then that's the kickoff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's music.
[SPEAKER_10]: The headliners have changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what the old headliners were and
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there hasn't been a change in those
bands, but they've added some other bigger
[SPEAKER_10]: bands to the venue that are now becoming
the headliners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, High Times has pretty good
connections to bands, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially now with the new owners and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they pull it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to be able to go next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at this point in time with how many
people are doing these events,
[SPEAKER_07]: you really got to pick and choose.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a person, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as a business person, when you're
wanting to get a booth, wanting to
[SPEAKER_07]: represent your company, man, can it become
expensive going to 50 of these events in a
[SPEAKER_07]: year?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of money for each one.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking to your dog there, Dee.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's giving her kisses.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always say definitely spreading the word
of cannabis.
Totally busted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Busted loving your dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my little doggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Dabbs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never even met Dabbs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I haven't seen you in months,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you haven't?
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't seen you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all live like...
[SPEAKER_10]: Hours away from each other and none of us
have seen each other in the last three or
[SPEAKER_07]: four months.
[SPEAKER_07]: John, I was in Jamaica with you last
month.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: On our home soil, though.
[SPEAKER_10]: You win that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you remember at Customs when I was
running away from you so I could clear?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, where is he going?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to clear Customs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm the guy that's doing the plane
check.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got pulled over and then shared some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, I got to spend a little bit
extra time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I went missing the connection
flight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you missed your flight.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went and got you, brought you back and
puffed you down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Saved you half a pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe it was even three quarters of a
pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot of pizza.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a couple of pizzas.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we were happy that we were able to
puff with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That took you two days or three days to
get back?
[SPEAKER_07]: Four.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was more than how many days it took you
to get there last trip in February.
[SPEAKER_10]: Last time in February, it took me three
days.
[SPEAKER_10]: But to give justice, I stepped off the
plane at 4.20 a.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: on bottom of his birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interrupt both of you because someone's
asking here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone says he likes to talk to Customs,
B-Man does not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not that Johnny B likes to talk
to Customs and B-Man doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that Johnny B, didn't Johnny B
call that lady a bitch or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that at Customs?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that was a different time.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be marked though.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be marked in the airport for
sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Custom guy told me he goes,
I like to talk to interesting people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he flayed me because he thought I was
interesting to talk to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, dude, that's so not what happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: You looked like an utter and complete
sketch ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your hair was pointing out in every
direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: He asked you what you were doing and you
said you were training doctors.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why he wanted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he said that's how interesting
social the whole thing on my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to mention here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's another poor thing that happened
that is was not Johnny B's fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they lose your luggage or
something?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or no, you came only for two days and you
were going to fly back.
[SPEAKER_07]: You only had clothes for two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: He ended up staying for like three extra
days with only this set of clothes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the shirt that he passed through
Customs with he had worn for like three
[SPEAKER_07]: days straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was also not his fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't have the like I always,
I shit you not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I save an outfit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole thing what happened in Jamaica
just happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we spent the next day going over having
that great time.
[SPEAKER_10]: More education.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, you know, where, where,
where did we go to Jack Keir's place?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went and dabbed out Jack here to the
point where we put him into a dab coma.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was DTF owed on his lawn chair.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next time I looked over,
he was actually gone, but that was okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I got to hang out with my buddy
Archie who's a really great grower in
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamaica, passed on some really nice seeds
to him while I was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully next time we go back,
Johnny B Archie will have, will you smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: some of Archie's Kush?
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to see how and what they're
growing there and what they're doing in
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's definitely a being a pretty,
uh, it's educational.
[SPEAKER_10]: See how that's changed up there in the
last four years since we've been going
[SPEAKER_10]: there and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you're a Kush snob for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: You liked it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, I wanted more.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I can't, I can't carry that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a Kush snob.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what works for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they say, that's what it's taking
years and know exactly what strains and
[SPEAKER_10]: what Kush's work for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because it's like, I could smell it
was like, that's what works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have that please?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we got right lit sitting there and
talking to Archie and Sean was also there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, a friend of ours from Jamaica,
which was, oh, it's always nice to see
[SPEAKER_07]: familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: When we were talking about what we're
doing there and educating on the prana
[SPEAKER_10]: line and the hemp line and stuff like
that, I'm starting to see some of these
[SPEAKER_10]: new products that are coming to light.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got eye drops with cannabinoids in
it, nasal sprays, all kinds of deodorant
[SPEAKER_10]: stick I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: The amount of these role ones and all of
these different products that are coming
[SPEAKER_10]: over CBD now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not one, but it's loads of different
products like this that are happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they release the rest of the
cannabinoids, you know, even though they
[SPEAKER_07]: haven't really released CBD, it's just
what everyone thinks they have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's this weird kind of like social
distorted perspective on cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone's like, Oh, it's the CBDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're allowed to have the CBDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I, I get mine from Switzerland and
yeah, it's the CBDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, man, when they finally release
this, when banking federal banking is
[SPEAKER_07]: allowed, and like federal release of this
like ridiculous peace treaty that all
[SPEAKER_07]: these countries, the drug and narcotics
peace treaty act, whatever it's called,
[SPEAKER_07]: get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like let countries do what they want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let people innovate how they want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let, you know, let the cream rise to the
top.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be ridiculous how much shit
we see in our lifetime in regards to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, new, unique, amazing cannabinoid
and terpene products.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing it now, seeing it now already,
but it's just hitting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just seeing it now, just the amount of
products that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like said, what do you order?
[SPEAKER_10]: Stink eye drops, those little sprays and
then like, what's the compared to coming
[SPEAKER_10]: out?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's so much stuff coming out there
with anything to infuse it to get
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids into your system.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you don't have to smoke it or taste it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's cool too, the way it happened,
because you know, Prohibition wanted to
[SPEAKER_07]: keep us in the dark ages forever,
but before Prohibition fell, we took
[SPEAKER_07]: ourselves out of the dark ages,
you know, from just like rolling spliffs
[SPEAKER_07]: to learning about concentrates and
isolating, separating terpenes and
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids and just learning so much
about the plants and opening, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the deeper in you go, the bigger it gets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Terrence says, how come the bigger in
you go or the deeper in you go,
[SPEAKER_07]: the bigger it gets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just seems to work like that with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's endless, lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do lifetimes on this plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how many questions you answer,
all it does is raise more questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone's asking me what my take on
tolerance breaks are useful or pointless.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, tolerance breaks are good
if you have resin that has a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've somehow acquired some like low
quality resin that just has a ceiling that
[SPEAKER_07]: every time you hit it, it doesn't elevate
you, then a tolerance break might be
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, better than a tolerance break,
in my opinion, is growing better resin,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, creating better plants,
making better isolates so that when you
[SPEAKER_07]: want those effects, regardless of how many
times you like, I'll tell you for sure,
[SPEAKER_07]: like the first time I met Sam,
well, not the first time I met him,
[SPEAKER_07]: the first time I smoked his hash on a
grand scale, like I got to hit it many,
[SPEAKER_07]: many times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't believe that every time I hit
it, it got me much, much, much higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how high, how high can you get?
[SPEAKER_07]: It almost felt like the difference between
just like eating a tab of acid and eating
[SPEAKER_07]: like 25 tabs of acid where you're like
literally become pure light and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I remember it anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was smoking some pretty good resin prior
to that full melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just drips through the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it just wasn't, you know,
it wasn't the strong genetics that he had.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was probably some weird hermaphroditic
version because Renee, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_07]: is a skunk number one, you know,
mutant or cross hybrid something.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said it was a Himalayan sativa
crossed with a skunk number one,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that sounded like more rumor than
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never really put much stock into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a very nice smile, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_07]: You looked almost smitten.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny B is packing it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Packing up the old doubler.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, yeah, an old double bubbler.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, my girl, lethal glass,
Elena, she made this and this was,
[SPEAKER_10]: she gave this to me about a year ago right
now when I first met her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I better be fine, but this is when
we, it's kind of like our anniversary is
[SPEAKER_10]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember waking up in the morning
and finding this pipe sitting in my little
[SPEAKER_10]: area here and it was the first gift she
gave me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've always been sitting here ever
since.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never really taken it out of here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always just come in here, like have my
little traditions in this as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be a real short hash church today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it like an hour, an hour and 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be kind of tight.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we were going to be doing some
squishing live and talking about that
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I kind of was feeling it,
but at the same time, I'd rather have soil
[SPEAKER_07]: grown and the Sasquatch crew in here and
really building that video.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have like a stacked rosin panel for,
uh, come on, show us the new dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even have it turned on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to get up and go around the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you come to Vancouver and play
with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming down the 23rd.
[SPEAKER_04]: My girlfriend's meet me down there and
we're having a hangout.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always good to hang out with the
girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then, what kind of fish were you
fishing for?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fishing for, uh, rainbows and
dollies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caught lots of dollies.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rainbows and butterflies.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dollies up here are pretty protected
in all the rivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't, uh, you don't keep any of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you, what are you using for bait?
I'm not telling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, a special, special.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't put a bong rip on the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: You come up and take it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll show you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, Dan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us your secrets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell everyone your secrets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maple syrup on his hooks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind sharing the ultimate biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beaver turps, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honey lure dipped in beaver turps works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beaver turps work.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then we'll fish in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been for a few years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to fish a lot, but, uh,
you sit on the river at like about four or
[SPEAKER_10]: five AM.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that sound like you see just
everybody?
[SPEAKER_10]: You just see big fat.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's being burned.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see the big cherries.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, who's on the river?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, someone's over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I mean, 90% of the guys on the
river, they already, they've got,
[SPEAKER_10]: they got their blazes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're, they're up there early.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're disabled or they're injured or
there's reasons why they're on the river.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just like early morning rises.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love the fish.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, it's, uh, it's definitely a,
if you're out there, the river where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're at, I've been fishing out there on
the better and everything, but I've also
[SPEAKER_04]: fished on rivers where you're,
you know, six feet apart from people
[SPEAKER_04]: taking turns cast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got 12, 14 foot rods going
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a fish on people are reeling in
the places that I'm going to up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take about three hours to four hours
just to drive into on dirt roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to use a little four wheeling and
the place you're going to, you're lucky to
[SPEAKER_04]: see anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the perfect part because you're
coming on a river bend and you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're seeing wildlife.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it's, it's beautiful
country that you feel you hasn't even been
[SPEAKER_04]: touched, but other people have been there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to find out somehow as well to go to
these good spots, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got my rhino.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to spots, but, uh, the farther you
go, the better the fish and you're fishing
[SPEAKER_04]: and catching all day, but that's where
that's fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to see fishing and catching.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the pinks are, are, are flowing up
in here right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, they're heading up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're going to be open
or not, but I want to go for that run in
[SPEAKER_04]: September long weekend, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, I'm going to go jump in my boat
later today, not to go fishing,
[SPEAKER_07]: but to drive around, cruise around,
maybe check the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw herring jumping last night,
but, uh, supposed to be 12 million pinks
[SPEAKER_07]: coming in if not already.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see what happens here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll look pretty cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done some fishing on the rivers and
got some monster salmon on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 plus ponders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are monsters.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one I caught on the Kitimat
River.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out my Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Proof is in the pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Proof is in the pictures except now with
Photoshop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would have been Photoshop.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Photoshop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got something to say when it
comes to the fish stories, but videos,
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures, if you had that, you know,
took the time to do that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather take the time to go fishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like eating them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, fishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to spend lots and lots of
time doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, for example, he'd give one of
his left nuts for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess his left nut because he doesn't
have two of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You only have one left, although I guess
you could put the right one in the left
[SPEAKER_07]: position if you were good.
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just sitting here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's social commentary, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's social.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we were talking about fishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like fishing all day and not
catching.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as I'm catching fish, I can fish
straight till dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to drag me off that river.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big fisherman myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like eating fish much better than
catching them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like catching them and then eat them on
the river.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring one of your plants down to the river
with you, Darren.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring one of your plants with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring one of your plants fishing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you'll get, you know, the fish will
be happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't grow up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll grow, but it'll die before it
finishes because it's too cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weather's already changing up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's changing down here too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can feel it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was up in Whistler a couple of days ago
and I could really feel it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Winter is definitely just around the
corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do catch and release almost everything
that I do catch, unless I'm going to eat
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like keeping the rainbows because we're
allowed to, because I like to smoke those,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we catch and release most everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got lots of grandkids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to take them fishing to catch fish
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I fish them all, they won't be none.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can fish them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you are a new fee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in my blood.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fly fish, rod fish, fish, fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fly fish and a casting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like all kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The coffee grinders, the level winders,
the flyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love fly fishing too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about fly fishing that
really, uh, you know, if you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you go to the river, you look around,
you see the bugs that are on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see the bugs that are flying around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You match those ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it on, you let it float around.
You see the bugs that are on the rocks.
You see the bugs that are on the rocks.
You see the bugs that are flying around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You let it float, then you see it come and
take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking amazing when that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you landed a real nicey too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, it's pretty neat when you trick
them that good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they don't bite on lures or
castings at all.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about David?
[SPEAKER_07]: David says, why is that even fun to catch
a fish and put holes in their face and
[SPEAKER_07]: then toss them back?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a Bartlett's hook.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a piercing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humans do it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just his perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause he's not a fisherman.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, David, you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I caught a salmon out in the house sound
here and it was exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've just, you know, put the salmon back
or whatever, but, uh, it was exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love catching fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love, love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I was fishing was in the
Himalayan mountains and I was kicking
[SPEAKER_03]: brown trout up in Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what basically dollies are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brown trout.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got the spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're the, they're the tough ones
are the sharks in the water, the fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Darren, I got, I got a book here
with all the fish and spots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, I'll look at the Fraser from years
and years and some great spots.
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely love bottom bouncing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what a true fucking fisherman does.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a journal that damn right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can show you all the spots,
the ones that I've had, what I've caught
[SPEAKER_10]: from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen all my fishing gear downstairs,
my waiters, all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I got tons of gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used to do acid doing, going fishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, I got, uh, I got some parts of my
journal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you got fish did, did, did five hits
of this type of acid, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the fish we caught and everything
like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you were catching fish.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was purely, you were just like purely
catching like a Loch Nix monster at that
[SPEAKER_10]: point, weren't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: The rainbows.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the rainbows that we were catching
just nice little four pounders,
[SPEAKER_04]: three pounders with, and the morning sun
coming off at the rainbow coming off of
[SPEAKER_04]: the fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, I can't keep you and eat you,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking take them off and let them go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it just looks so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony's got a fish story.
[SPEAKER_10]: He just jumped in Tony.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your fish story?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Tony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fish story.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fish story, fish story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I have a fish story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was much younger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I went fishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, outside of Florida, a little deep sea
on a three or four day where you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: sleep on a boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, it sounds, sounded like a really
fun time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I was like 16 or 15 and I
said, yeah, let's go out with my brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to, we're going to go out on a
deep sea fishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and basically, uh, you know,
I was, I had different picture in my mind
[SPEAKER_05]: about what that adventure would be,
but really what ended up happening was it
[SPEAKER_05]: was a fish fishing boat, uh, that had like
probably 15 people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole time it was like a 24 hour
fishing day and night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and like you pay to go to this fishing
trip, but yet we were catching like,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, you know, we were trying to catch
schools of yellow tails or groupers or
[SPEAKER_05]: snapper.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to find all these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but we weren't really fishing to keep
the fish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing I know, I was like about
day two, I tried to, I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, I'm really tired.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, where do, where do people
sleep and they're like, oh, you go
[SPEAKER_05]: downstairs, like downstairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go downstairs, which is like cots,
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That are stacked.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a cot and then a cot and then
a cot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And literally, I remember trying to get
sleep and I was laying in one of these
[SPEAKER_05]: cots and there was like another human
being like right above me in their cot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, if they pass gas or
they make a sound or they do anything,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's within couple inches of your body,
like very sleep in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like trying to sleep there for a
while and I was, and uh, I couldn't sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like three people snoring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like human body right on top of
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I went out to the deck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to sleep on the deck when there
was a big moon and I got this great idea
[SPEAKER_05]: that I'm just going to take one of the
pieces of like this Barracuda that we
[SPEAKER_05]: caught with a giant hook with a giant
metal leader and just like go deep sea and
[SPEAKER_05]: try to catch a shark.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I spent like, I don't know,
like 30 minutes rigging this thing up
[SPEAKER_05]: giant piece of bait, like just huge like
off of a three footer and just like
[SPEAKER_05]: wrapped around this hook and dropped it
and waited.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I must've waited like, God,
I don't know, like an hour and a half to
[SPEAKER_05]: where you get like delusional where you
think the like rod is actually moving when
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not, you know, you're like,
Oh, I think I might got a hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have a hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I think one of my brother's like,
you don't have a hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, no, it's like moving kind of
weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, Oh, you probably hit bottom or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have bottom out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the pole just started to move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, just like moving like this
and, uh, about an hour and 45 minutes
[SPEAKER_05]: online.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting there struggling with it,
struggling with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My arms are dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've passed this pole to two brothers,
the captain, different people like bring
[SPEAKER_05]: it up, bring it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I pull it all the way up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, Oh, it was like a giant,
huge, like a 11 foot nurse shark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, as soon as the captain saw it,
took the knife out and cut the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, it's like, we're done here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cut the, cut the fish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, and I remember I was like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, it's a nurse shark.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not catching, we're not out here for
nurse shark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he just cut it and let it go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like one of my fishing stories,
but it was a huge nurse shark.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty ridiculous that you caught a
shark, a nurse shark, a nurse shark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent story too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I must say good fish story to be jumping
on right on church and pull that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went from a 50 pound salmon to an 11
foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, like the let down,
it was a three hour ordeal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like when the let from the concept to
getting a fish, but like when that guy
[SPEAKER_05]: took out that knife and without even
hesitation, just cut it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just cut the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, you're done here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to catch a nurse shark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was like a, he was just,
he was like, we're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was like the, the excitement
was gone, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in a second, I didn't understand it
as a kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, what do you mean we could eat
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not bringing that into the boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, at the end it was like,
I kind of like realized what was going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a commercial fishing boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, what about all these fish that
we caught?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, you paid, you know,
if you caught a certain amount of fish,
[SPEAKER_05]: you paid your way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's going to refund the four or 500
bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, man, we've been catching
fish for three days here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got thousands of pounds of
commercial grade fish for restaurants.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy was going to make a killing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then it was like, I remember kind of
negotiating with him with my brother and
[SPEAKER_05]: he was just like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, well, I'm just saying that like
we've caught, you know, I've personally
[SPEAKER_05]: caught 50 different types of fish at this
size.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like trying to get fish out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, I just want a red
snapper, a grouper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just want something that we
caught so we can eat it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, well, I'm not going to give you
your money for the trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I didn't sign up to be labor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I signed up to go fishing, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm not your like commercial labor,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you pay for it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super slick move.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he had 15 people, 15 people paying
like six, seven hundred, maybe even a
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand, you know, everybody pays their
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You sleep in Koch, you fish for this guy
for three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, making it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Killing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He sells it for like 12 grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those fish were worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was, I'm telling you,
there was like live coolers and like,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was a pretty big commercial boat and
all we did was fish 24 hours day and
[SPEAKER_05]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like late nineties, though, you know,
things were tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some nice sleep today, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I needed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I slept yesterday and today I have a
toddler, so I just don't sleep at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get over it after like year two.
[SPEAKER_10]: Year two.
[SPEAKER_10]: After year two, you just get used to not
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get used to operating in this like
extreme sleep deprivation state where you
[SPEAKER_07]: just, yeah, you just make it happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to run in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to run into Etienne next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was at a game.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a little present for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That can always pop over too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way to do it right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Golly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The strawberry banana goo full melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for these terpene reports to
see the difference between full melt,
[SPEAKER_05]: a hash rosin and a flower rosin and the
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be interesting because this,
they all uniquely smell different.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think I do think I like the smell
of the full melt better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So does it spell more strawberry or more
banana?
[SPEAKER_05]: This full melt smells more strawberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the I would say the the hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that somewhere to see the hash
rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the banana come out in the flavor
then when you hit it?
[SPEAKER_05]: The hash rosin has a good balance of the
two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I smoked through all that hash rosin?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: That tells you what's better.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what tells you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the ultimate like test right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what got smoked first?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want numbers and what you think of
the effects and the taste and the blah,
[SPEAKER_07]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it on a table.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put a bunch of heads in the room and tell
me which one's gone first.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is for sure the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's gone.
Promise.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's the hash rosin gone?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's the hash rosin gone?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Tony.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a fiend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was sitting on the table the
longest though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you're right because the it's
hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like and also the hash is like a full
melt a little more subtle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I just let this thing melt and
but it is more strawberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out though because it looks
like Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have all the terpene test back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: The terpene test is the last thing usually
the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's always good to get the
pesticide free one in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be like right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, that's like your when we
were talking about resin profiles
[SPEAKER_05]: nowadays, especially in California,
and I think it'll be a trend everywhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially when you're smoking something
is to the parts per billion in pesticides
[SPEAKER_05]: for concentrates and flowers goes back to
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, people a lot of people say,
oh yeah, I don't use pesticides and then
[SPEAKER_05]: they fail it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, based on where they're getting
their clones from and things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So or that they're liars or they're liars.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, I think that like some of
these people just they're not lying
[SPEAKER_05]: though.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just like growing outdoors or
trying to do as best they can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they get like maybe a tainted clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flowers don't test positive or there's
a nearby field or they're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, other farms that aren't cannabis
or spraying really devastates.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're not lying and you're
trying to do the right thing and you get
[SPEAKER_05]: that, it really I could it just devastates
people and their hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think you had an episode with
Brian from vital.
[SPEAKER_05]: On talking about clone certification,
we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be the next.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the next move for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I invited him in today, but he I'm not
sure it was last minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't give anyone any.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't plan to show today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, just do a show.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one hundred fifty two episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're four episodes away from three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty ridiculous, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabs up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you have the fat end of the scoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is the last.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the pen while hitting the the dab
rig as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that it gives me a super spacey
trippy high.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that you've had it for like a week,
you've made your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of see what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't take a you don't really
take in like this, which are being hits
[SPEAKER_05]: before.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is I feel there's a completely
different experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you've had it for a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my unique anomaly that I experienced
right off the bat was my first cartridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is my bike squished?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see that 30 percent squish we did?
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking video is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one hundred and thirty grams per
pound for those that are listed and thirty
[SPEAKER_05]: six hundred thirty six grams.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cuts on the way anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to give that away to some people.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what it did was, OK, I put like five
point seven drops of Clementine into a
[SPEAKER_07]: half gram of this rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it was like it didn't quite get a
half gram or a gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a gram.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's five point seven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a grab program.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, OK, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: A gram, which made two cartridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't taste the Clementine and we
couldn't taste.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also put a drop of sour tangy in there
just for good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Measure because it was also citrusy and
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had it there and I was just like,
I'm just going to throw a drop of this
[SPEAKER_07]: into made it real nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the oil was just perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: But all it tasted like was where is my
bike?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one hundred percent the where is my
bike terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it took.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was so loud.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like so loud, like 10 times louder
than it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, instead of getting like
Clementine, it assimilated the Clementine,
[SPEAKER_07]: turned it into its own terp profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that pen hit it right to the last
drop, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfection.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fucking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My computer almost died.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the that's why I say the last
video I'm going to make for those that are
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they're selling them already
empty, but there's videos on bubble man
[SPEAKER_05]: brand YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not your not your bubble man's world,
but there's a how to turn it on,
[SPEAKER_05]: how to get different controlled tabs out
of it, how to fill it, how to clean it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can show them right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll show a couple of the videos while
you're talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I would say that I get a lot of
people that they don't get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can tell it's a different tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the top part of any of like if you
put a live rosin or any sauces in there
[SPEAKER_05]: and then what it does, it's so powerful
that it warms it up and turns it into oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that goes through four holes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just it's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people got to get used to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm showing the video of you filling
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first looked at these, I thought,
holy shit, these are going to be really
[SPEAKER_07]: hard to fill.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I filled the first two,
I didn't I actually spilled one single
[SPEAKER_07]: drop that fell off the tip of my syringe
and I ended up scooping it up and the one
[SPEAKER_05]: thing with it is if you see how I go in a
little in a little round, I did the same
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to do that circular thing and go
because it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I hit the pen and I hit my rig
and I'm honestly I think my pen tastes
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Sam was talking about today.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, is there a pen that starts
out or a dabber that starts out low and it
[SPEAKER_07]: gets warmer and gets warmer?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what we did, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about it for the last he's
definitely been talking about it for the
[SPEAKER_07]: last two plus years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was the thing I figured out
because, you know, it's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And talking with Gary, I'm like,
all right, what are these temperature
[SPEAKER_05]: settings?
[SPEAKER_05]: And like if you hit it for like three to
four seconds, you're definitely going to
[SPEAKER_05]: get a you're definitely going to get like
that five fifty low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you hold it the full twelve,
you're more like six fifty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you hold it again for another
twelve, it's like over seven fifty.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way I've been doing it is I'll go
I'll kind of hit it like for three
[SPEAKER_05]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll hit it again for three seconds
or five seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm kind of like controlling like the
dab by the by the seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, a twelve second a twelve
second rip is is really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good cloud, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clubs out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives me a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got an anxiety attack from a
wake and bake with this paint pen the
[SPEAKER_07]: other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, damn, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brought me right to the brink.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a cloud for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: What were you hitting, bubble man?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the where's my bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the where's my bike right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have this is lemon tree with Headbanger
Kush and it's all lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no Headbanger Kush profile
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it named by Hoffman when he took his
first trip?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was named by Karma Genetics
when he lost his bike after smoking it in
[SPEAKER_07]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be that he gave that cut out to
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he lives in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the story I assumed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll have Karma on on Hash Church
in the near future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll invite him right fucking now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, one thing I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you have and it's so hard,
I kept telling you, pull, press,
[SPEAKER_05]: pull.
[SPEAKER_05]: You constantly want to pull air through
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm only saying this because I know
Gary started selling these things and I
[SPEAKER_05]: was trying to explain the oil content.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't necessarily you don't
necessarily have to do it with terpenes,
[SPEAKER_05]: the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's other questions online.
[SPEAKER_05]: The terpenes aren't diluted.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not diluted with anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing to dilute them with.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are the dilution for the rosy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a weird one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one thing I was going to say is
you could do like if you look at how to
[SPEAKER_05]: clean the tanks and right now he's
watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in the chat room up tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just said, what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so the main thing like that I noticed
with this keeping this thing clean,
[SPEAKER_05]: like you could always clean it with a
Q-tip if there's ever a little oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this has a hole that goes all the way
through the goes all the way through the
[SPEAKER_05]: tank, which is you could see it right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different than other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're if you just and I see a lot
of people do this and I've been trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: get them not to if you hit this button and
you just hold this button before you hit
[SPEAKER_05]: it, you're just you're hitting it wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's like, oh, let me just let me
just crush this button.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very powerful battery.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to pull, press, pull.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was going to say you could if
you didn't have terpenes at home,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could take your rosin like flour
rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could take things in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do, but I've done it just to try
to see if I could do it, which was you
[SPEAKER_05]: could gently take your rosin in a bowl and
gently double boil it, put it in a water
[SPEAKER_05]: bath, and that will slowly go from a THCA
and you're going to slowly decarb it when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really low temps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like, you know, a glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these things, just like we show on
how to clean the video and we put it
[SPEAKER_05]: inside another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could put that inside a little pot of
water and get it down to in the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, hundred and hundred and ten
degree hundred and five hundred and twenty
[SPEAKER_05]: degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to play with it based on your
elevation and where you're living.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could gently warm your flour
rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you warm it up, it'll melt down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could whip it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll turn into a much more kind of the
viscosity is going to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while it's warm, you could suck it up
with a glass or inch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't necessarily need terpenes,
in my opinion, to necessarily get it to
[SPEAKER_05]: get it to work in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually put put that in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a terpene content.
[SPEAKER_05]: If something is like seven percent,
five percent, ten percent, terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: content, it'll work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You follow what I'm saying, bubble man?
[SPEAKER_05]: It does initially have to have terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing is powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will if you could get your oil in
here, it will work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works for distill it to distill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, a distillate with terpenes
actually tastes really good or a live
[SPEAKER_05]: rosin or live resin, like a live resin
with a little bit of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried it with a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But ultimately, you know, what we're
trying to do is do everything without
[SPEAKER_05]: heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to preserve everything we
can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it as pasty as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have hash rosin or flour rosin,
gently warm it up, get it warm to get it
[SPEAKER_05]: in the vial, then to get it into your
tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to do a couple of videos of
that, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time for some terp sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, Etienne, come by if you can,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have a little I'll have a little
basket for you and Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack Frost Terp Sugar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Such a shot of goodness in it,
like you can't even really explain it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How nice that tastes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full blown terpene profile in the
foreground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so trippy.
[SPEAKER_07]: At first you're like, oh, it's sugary.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, but it's Jack Frost Sugar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then long after the sugar is gone,
after you pick the last piece out of your
[SPEAKER_07]: tooth, the xylitol, whatever, it's you can
still taste those terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I gave you sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do monk fruit now, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm waiting for the pop rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terp, terp rocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terp rocks, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to dab this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make some of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how this melts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got no water in your bubbler or what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you no longer have to use the inside
blower anymore there, Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're in a different spot now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to get fucked with that
landlord.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, your shit is loud when everyone
in your apartment just is like,
[SPEAKER_07]: get out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy's selling weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got hundreds of pounds in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thousands of pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way it smells, he must have had
multiple tours of disbelief where they
[SPEAKER_07]: couldn't believe nothing was in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they came in and they were like,
no, it's not here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, it could be when I
opened this freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what's in this freezer?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, vials of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like vials of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, you know, plant essence and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like perfumes and essence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, well, open up the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a woof.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that must be what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, could be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it's kept in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, I have that rabbit air.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a guy on hash church that
messaged me in like January.
[SPEAKER_05]: This rabbit air filter for the home has
been great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm using a, I'm in a different
location, but I'm using a pure air.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little, I'll show you this other
device.
[SPEAKER_05]: This does like bipolar ionization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's positive and negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does like, I don't know, we've been
using them in the lab facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pure air, they do like up to 3000
square feet and they kill all dust,
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes, pathogens, bacterias,
molds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like really good air purification.
[SPEAKER_05]: And odor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll show you this little one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what the terpenes in the
forest do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love living in a forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have this sort of antiseptic,
you know, just terps floating in the air
[SPEAKER_07]: all around us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cedar terps and Douglas fir terps and
maple terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might be time for a little puff
on the rig because I haven't had enough
[SPEAKER_07]: puffing today, apparently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This little thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean pretty solid on the puff.
[SPEAKER_07]: This company, this company.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called green tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pure air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little bad boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small, super small.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a little filter on the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that an ionizer?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does positive and negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I gotta get the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the ionizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, I've been bone-ripping the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're holding it down here, aren't we,
down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we used Quest, but this is also,
this is for the air quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is supposed to like, you know,
you won't get sick, less people getting
[SPEAKER_05]: sick at work too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what it says here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean the filter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, this doesn't have the selling
pitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all in the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uses filtrations, bipolar ionization,
ozone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Removes some of the toughest odors and
contaminations for noticeably clean and
[SPEAKER_05]: fresher space.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ionizer creates the ozone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it looked like to me in
ionizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does positive and negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're positively negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bipolar, it says to go either way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, between the rabbit air and
that it's pretty, pretty damn on point,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_05]: No bipolar.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neurosis is red.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will help cure the bipolar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I gotta tell you, that was pretty
melty.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was from the greenhouse too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even the indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turbo files.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ozone is bad for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ozone is bad for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's super great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on, how much comes out of it,
but O3.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very small amount of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When lightning goes off in the sky,
you can in the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: When lightning goes off in the sky,
in the sky?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the rabbit air does not use ozone.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rabbit air has like seven filters that
it pulls air through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that thing has been unstoppable.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's also like a six or $700 filter
for your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing, I think was like maybe 200
bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Couple hundo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ozoneization, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would like to know how much ozone it puts
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to squish a pound and get a
30% of what I'm gonna do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you, so, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does it actually taste like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What terpene is the, what is it in my
drink?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dude, like terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And lend a like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I almost have to, I wish I had my,
where's my bike right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The resin was so beautiful looking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it came out golden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it got to get like combined,
it kind of was orangey amber.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just, everyone there liked it
the most.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was just, we squished a bunch of
things and everyone was like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: look at that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the genetics of it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me check real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I don't want to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wish I could just invite karma in
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just see real quick here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the genetics, where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_07]: So are they going to tell us what it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: The mother is Karma's award-winning
amnesia cut across to the biker Kush mail.
[SPEAKER_07]: The biker Kush has changed the THC
profile, giving it some very high test
[SPEAKER_07]: results.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the amnesia is the D cut variety,
mostly sativa yield high plant height,
[SPEAKER_07]: 160.
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 centimeters, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the flower time?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the flower cycle?
[SPEAKER_07]: The flower cycle is nine to 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a little longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for 30%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for that kind of return.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, if there's, listen in a perfect
world, in a perfect world, when you sold
[SPEAKER_07]: the raws and Sasquatch, raws and presses,
you could send these cuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the cuts that we've been sending
cuts to all our people and people send us
[SPEAKER_07]: cuts back and we do the tests and these
are the highest yields, the nicest
[SPEAKER_07]: profiles, the this, that, and the other
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That 30% is unique because it's really
nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a profile that you would expect
to be on something that didn't yield much,
[SPEAKER_07]: that didn't produce much.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus it has this crazy high THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's also like, not only do you get
this anxious terpene profile, but you get
[SPEAKER_07]: this wicked strong THC like, I liked it a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it'd be interesting to see that
crossing with other things, but that
[SPEAKER_05]: sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a really nice,
and I know that amnesia haze, it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: really high terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that profile, that terpene might just
come out really, might work really well in
[SPEAKER_05]: a heat temperature, pressure type of thing
with Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I said that it was amnesia haze
and someone was like, no, it's not amnesia
[SPEAKER_07]: haze, it's amnesia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just amnesia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it might be some other different
cut, but I think it's, I thought it was
[SPEAKER_07]: amnesia haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tasted like it for sure, but I don't
want to, we're on Hash Church and I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: want to give away anything that's the
wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, maybe Karma can come on and
talk about it, but whatever the D cut is,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounded like somebody said fluorine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It did sound like someone said,
is that fluorine?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was my whoop, she has a big mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, what'd she say?
[SPEAKER_03]: She was talking about something,
but she didn't realize she was sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: right next to a microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We barely heard her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it is amnesia haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, no, amnesia OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: If she has anything important,
I'll get her to speak a little louder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please, please let her know that if
she has anything important to share with
[SPEAKER_07]: us, we can use all the help we can get
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So most of the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amnesia is different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so amnesia is like an amnesia OG or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get Karma on here to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, really, really nice profile
when particularly mixed with the
[SPEAKER_07]: clementine, which just produced more of,
it was like putting terpenes of the same
[SPEAKER_07]: profile into this rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the rosin made from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it from water hash, dry sift,
buds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was from a bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you see the squish?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I mean, unless what you just had
on a while ago was a squish, I didn't see
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but 30% from bud, Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a religious experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, even my friend Neil,
who told me, because it was his bud,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's like, I got a cultivar that should
press out about 30%.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, 30%.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, I'm telling you, I did only a
couple grams before, but I got like 30%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I have an eight gram bud of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, all right, well, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was the first thing I pressed on my
M1 Sasquatch press.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the first thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And lo and behold, like 29 point something
percent, like it was eight grams in and
[SPEAKER_07]: 2.35 grams out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't even squish the pack a
second time and there was a little bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: oil in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Crushed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, the folks that are selling
squish, they should include the clone with
[SPEAKER_03]: each squisher.
[SPEAKER_07]: For real, I'm telling you, in a perfect
world, and the same with bubble bags and
[SPEAKER_07]: dry sift screens and all that stuff,
like cultivars that are tried and true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That super perform under a particular
methodology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That knowledge should spread around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 100% an imperative piece of the
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, you're in scarcity.
[SPEAKER_07]: People like to hold their shit close.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure now that I've been promoting this
Karma's bike, the cut will be harder to
[SPEAKER_07]: get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for me, because when I get it,
I'll fucking give it to everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why wouldn't you give that cut to people?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that could use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like people that are like,
well, if you had to grow a million plants
[SPEAKER_03]: to find that one plant, I can understand
it or a particular years to find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if somebody just gave it to you,
my buddy bought the seeds from Karma
[SPEAKER_07]: Genetics and cracked it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, it's just, it's just a seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can, you can get it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think it gives 30%?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I have no idea, but I suspect the
planets lined up when mom and dad got
[SPEAKER_07]: together and shit was just like,
you know, when the angels sing like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot pretend you would have a way
better idea why such a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to analyze it,
the rosin and see is it super high in
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes or THC or what is the profile?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it absolutely will be.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be getting tested in the very near
future, very near future.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suspect it will be shared far and
wide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check out Karma Genetics if you want
yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I did want to say that after
the last hash church, we pulled,
[SPEAKER_05]: I will share it with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to actually have it today
because it would have ruined my Sunday,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's a, I have a blue vile of Azulene
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we sent out for testing on like
Thursday or Friday.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we tested out for terpene analysis as
well as potency, but it is, it smells like
[SPEAKER_05]: a, like a, like a fuely gasoline,
like super, super absurd, like gasoline
[SPEAKER_05]: smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a terpene that came off of,
came out of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't like it though, it's mad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because, you know, a lot of people
like look down on, let's say the process
[SPEAKER_05]: of distillation, which I find pretty funny
because distillation is just like a
[SPEAKER_05]: method.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a purification at the very end.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean like you've taken
something horrible and made it better
[SPEAKER_05]: because it only makes it worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the microscope, meaning if it starts
out tainted, it's going to get worse and
[SPEAKER_05]: worse, especially if you have on a
distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, you can't just pull
everything out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't pull pesticides out,
but if you use distillate correctly and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing whole plant extractions and
it's just part of the last process,
[SPEAKER_05]: it just, you know, people are just using
like steam and vacuum to separate and
[SPEAKER_05]: different temperatures to separate out
different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be in the resin to get to a
pure form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that process, terpenes are
eliminated, fats are eliminated,
[SPEAKER_05]: different things to get to a 95 or 94%
clean distillate without any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that process, there is a terpene
that can come off of it called Azalea,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a blue, it's like pretty blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the color of the sky blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Show it to you next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really raunchy, it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had an incredible Jack Frost terp
burp.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you would not want to have an Azalea
burp.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome Subcool to the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mic is on mute if you've been trying
to talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't heard you yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You came in when Tony was talking and it
was reverberating the mic, so I had to
[SPEAKER_07]: mute it, but feel free to unmute it and
say hello if you are indeed here and can
[SPEAKER_07]: hear me.
[SPEAKER_07]: What cultivar would you give a recommend
with bubble bags versus screens?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, screens, I'd probably go
for some like some of Sam's skunk number
[SPEAKER_07]: one or that SleeStack across with skunk
number one or even SleeStack alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that also good, Sam, or was it the
SleeStack skunk that really reigned?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, SleeStack by itself is way better than
SleeStack skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried combining the two of them in the
dream, but the dream was not fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, no worries, no worries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sub's in the house driving his car again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just took a 480 temp dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rocking the 480.
[SPEAKER_05]: For that bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Sub's been working on his squish
game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been loving my M1 too, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun little unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's trying to unmute, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be in a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still got 600 people in the room watching,
a lot of people in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that, Dan Richards just ordered my
Amnesia OG aka where's my bike seats after
[SPEAKER_07]: listening to this chat.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey brother, how you guys doing tonight?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, it's been very chill,
very chill day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go, I'm actually on a hash run
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go pick up some pinot from one of
my Ashco's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mainly log on to listen to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much from, that's why I
usually log on and don't usually say a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn lots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man, no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always something to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a real chill episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're like four episodes away
from our three year anniversary and I got
[SPEAKER_07]: to make a plan for that show to be like
just absolute crusher of a show because
[SPEAKER_07]: three years is a big milestone,
you know, every Sunday gearing up and
[SPEAKER_07]: linking up and meeting and having these
little events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people don't even have emails for
three years anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey sub, did you, is one of your varieties
that you've created called Cheesequake or
[SPEAKER_05]: is it somebody else?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I think Cheesequake is sub.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scared him off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny B said by accident.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's coming back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny B just bounced out of the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: His foot unplugged his microphone and the
camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is going to come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought he was in a rally car at first
and then I saw the baby seat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was like a razor,
like one of those little mini side-by-side
[SPEAKER_07]: cards.
[SPEAKER_07]: He looked kind of like in this,
in a little like, but yeah, sub has
[SPEAKER_07]: cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheesequake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheesequake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quake.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a, like a couple pounds of it,
a whole plant to terp for the first time
[SPEAKER_05]: to actually extract terpenes from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has, it's kind of interesting
because I've only seen a few sub things,
[SPEAKER_05]: but each time I've seen it, like the jilly
bean, but each time I've seen it,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's always like an expression of the
terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like really profound in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's something he's always
just bred for, looks for early on in the
[SPEAKER_05]: day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just said, I'm going to breed for
terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to breed for terpenes,
but really strong expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it comes out in the
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another one ordering seeds of the,
where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_07]: Colin, Jane, Clifford, let us know if
you're getting those 30% yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you, even if you fuck up and get
24, I was thinking the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you fuck up and you're only getting
24%, it's still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything over 20, you're dancing,
you know, that's like, you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, in my opinion, you should be like,
at Vesa should be producing, where is my
[SPEAKER_07]: bike clones to supply all of their growers
and the relationships that they,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like, Hey, you should try this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that'll get more than 25% wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did out by the Ross and press companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your staple.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you can make all kinds of
medicine from that too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Tony, with that, what, what cleaning do
you need to do to keep it and maintain it
[SPEAKER_08]: currently, or that you've found that,
or tips and tricks to the trade that
[SPEAKER_08]: you've found?
[SPEAKER_08]: So keeping what clean?
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the, the new stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Trinity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a video on there of how to
clean it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this is the best trick and how often
are you cleaning it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time, every time you go through your
tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you go, if you smoke a hole,
like, uh, it's a, it's a 0.8 tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you could put more than 0.5 in there
if you wanted the first round,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, um, it's a 0.8 tank and I would say
I've smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've, I filled it up after I went.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I filled the first thing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through it and then I filled it up
again and went through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that I didn't go through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say if it was on a taste rating of
a hundred percent being clean all the way
[SPEAKER_05]: through, uh, you know, you're in the a
hundred when it first starts to,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say the sweet spot when this tank gets
going is like 25% of the way through it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it starts to taste really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, really good halfway through and
towards the end, it's even better and
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if you try to reload this again,
the taste is still okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it probably loses maybe 5% in
the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and you could go through it a second
time, but I feel like that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: wearing and tearing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you wanted to like keep this,
you know, say 10 times over, the best
[SPEAKER_05]: thing in my opinion is use it and then
clean it and then fill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then use it again and you'll,
you could get like, you know, 10 times,
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 times out of it, you know, easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you push it and you keep,
uh, and you just keep filling it without
[SPEAKER_05]: cleaning it, I think that's when you're
going to blow this thing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it three times before,
but, um, I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just clean it every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy to clean it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could actually, if you actually
just, uh, follow the instructions,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like taking the screw cap
off, drop it in ISO 99%, wait 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_05]: drop it in filtered water, rinse it again
in filtered water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can leave it sit there for a few
hours, even in just water, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: which tells you this thing's, uh,
made a different, differently if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: able to just soak it in water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but use filtered water or Fiji water,
you know, something, something that's
[SPEAKER_05]: really clean and, uh, let it air dry and
then refill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it doesn't really take that much to,
to clean them, but you definitely want to
[SPEAKER_05]: have two of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could have one cleaning while the
other one is being used.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the video.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I played the video while you were
talking, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that's so in that video,
there's a hot bath method.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the fastest way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you didn't want it, like,
I feel like a deep clean is let it sit in
[SPEAKER_05]: ISO 24, but if you did the hot bath and
went like 15, 20 minutes, it does a pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: damn good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like cleaning it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I didn't see any problems with it,
um, or difference, but I would say that
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe if he, if you did the quick hot
bath, like the first five times,
[SPEAKER_05]: like maybe your fifth time to a deep
clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I mean, that's the big thing about
the tank is that you get to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sell them in six packs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone says, I like the word quiver
myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be cool to get like a six tank
quiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, do like a, do like a cream,
a live rosin sauce, like, like six
[SPEAKER_05]: different ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get like a case.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a quiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a quiver case.
[SPEAKER_07]: A quiver will have you quivering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony Tony,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you have big hands or is the pen just
tiny?
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of have big hands, but the pen is
not tiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those hands might've been Gary's hands
if they're on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, when the video, I guess I'm gonna have
big hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, can you fit your whole pen behind
yours?
[SPEAKER_06]: The pen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you put it all behind your hand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got big hands too, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I puffed really hard to this whole show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Mr. Hyde, if it seems like a waste,
when you clean it, clean it out with like
[SPEAKER_07]: ethanol instead of ISO, then you can
evaporate the ethanol and, or whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: that is, you know, the, the pure alcohol
that people use green alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can use green alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does a really good job getting all
the oil all the way down.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is like, if you get like a creamy
stuff, I will admit there is a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: up on the tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I've done with that is I will
warm it up on the edge of, I know Gary
[SPEAKER_05]: will probably mad at me, but I just like
leave it just the edge of the till it
[SPEAKER_06]: drips down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, just like on the D nail,
just warm it up a little bit and it just
[SPEAKER_05]: turns into an oil and it drips down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just if it's cream,
you know, like not every, we were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about the different resin and not
everything's going to turn creamy,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, but the creamy stuff does that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you wondering what we're
talking about, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that pen really rips.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the oils when you put the rosin in
with the terpenes, it just, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a perfect example, actually,
main sort of types that you'll get,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a really nice kind of cream on
the right there on the lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually on the left, it's flipped.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the other side, the
Clementine, which is much more of a saucy,
[SPEAKER_07]: oily, you know, pull and snap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really because it pours, but those two
different rosins were very different to
[SPEAKER_07]: work with and turf sauces, I guess I
should call them, or turf oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is, is this pen really,
Tony, is just in time for terpenes going
[SPEAKER_07]: down in price, because trying to fill
these up in the Canadian market at $10 a
[SPEAKER_07]: drop or whatever is damn near impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to be able to do the, be able to make
the terpenes and be able to get them at a
[SPEAKER_07]: price where you can put them in these pens
and it's not, you know, like $400 per
[SPEAKER_07]: cartridge or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of terps in these pens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and they are not fruit terpenes or
someone else's weird little recipe that
[SPEAKER_07]: they've come up with.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like beautiful cannabis profiles,
cannabis terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shit, Jerry Lee Lewis is dead,
huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sorry to hear, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another famous person dies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine all the like not famous people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: 29,000 people just died all over the world
in different parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe more.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think every minute?
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people die every minute in the
world?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be a pretty high number.
[SPEAKER_07]: With 7 billion of us kicking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got this, oh, Jerry Lewis.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Must have been Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say Jerry Lewis was even
alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you should give a little more
respect to Jerry Lewis.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a special man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not just a man, just another guy that
died.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worshipped.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he raised a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember almost every year around
hurricane time, which is Labor Day
[SPEAKER_08]: weekend, he did his telethon and raised,
you know, how many millions of dollars in
[SPEAKER_08]: awareness to, you know, diseases and,
you know, help many.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I got to give him props for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started as a crazy actor.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has mad sons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actor humanitarian.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't see it every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So slowly melt that all the way down off
the edges.
[SPEAKER_07]: 105 people die a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: 105 people die a minute on earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people are born though?
[SPEAKER_05]: A minute?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the real question, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, every once in a while,
what's that sound?
[SPEAKER_03]: 106 are born every minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how many are dead?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every minute 105.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's one in one out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people really die every minute?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just screwed around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you say that term was bubble man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you say it was how many people die
per minute?
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm in an argument because people are
like, Oh, I can't believe you put him
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I didn't mean to put him down as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned that millions of other people
are dying as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And although they may not have raised
money for children and diseases,
[SPEAKER_07]: it doesn't make them any less sort of,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put a lot of weird shit into fame.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when people are famous, regardless of
what they do, he didn't even have to raise
[SPEAKER_07]: money for kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: He could have written a fucking song and
we would have all been like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: RIP, so and so.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying it's like, I, we tend to
put certain people on pedestals above
[SPEAKER_07]: other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all I'm saying is, Hey, RIP for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not, not shitting on Jerry Lewis,
but just saying, Hey, how about all died?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry Lewis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that he did that I
liked was he only wore a pair of socks
[SPEAKER_03]: once and then he gave them away.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who else does that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Floyd money Mayweather.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new pair of socks once every
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I know that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause my head is full of useless shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Life is fragile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clint for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But icon waste also is accurate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck celebrity worship.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just worship good people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good people are worth like, no,
and maybe he was a great person.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure he was.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know him at all in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_07]: For all I know, he ran some shape shifting
reptilian baby mill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he was an interesting guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't put it past.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could have done that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he still would have been all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say anything, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no, he's a RIP.
[SPEAKER_07]: Classic.
Classic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can picture some of his skits.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he was part of like, you know,
the, uh, Dean Martin and no, no,
[SPEAKER_07]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the rat pack, the rat pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reminds me.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was one of those guys that reminded me
of Casey Kasem, like a guy that just kept
[SPEAKER_07]: getting older, but didn't seem to look
older and just lived forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's sad when people die.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's why I wanted to, well,
that's why I wanted to say how many people
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine Dana Larson lobbying the
BC government to use microbutanol.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we'd have to have Dana on to talk
about that, but, uh, well, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to get some food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those that, um, did get the tanks
just to know that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to need some glass syringe or
some little small applicator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I use a glass syringe with a 14 gauge
or 12 gauge, the biggest one they have to
[SPEAKER_05]: pull it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I use the smaller like 10 gauge
tip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just switched the tip to a smaller one
to fill it, to fill it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I've got Gary, um, finding ones for us
right now so that they can be included in
[SPEAKER_07]: the kits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: He raised two billion dollars to muscular
dystrophy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have there been any, have there been any
breakthroughs in muscular dystrophy with
[SPEAKER_07]: that two billion dollars?
[SPEAKER_07]: There must have been.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I always am leery of sort of
pharmaceutical raising, like the money to
[SPEAKER_07]: raise for disease, like the cancer
raising.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was more like giving them a
home or like a hospital bed or like care,
[SPEAKER_05]: not so much like, uh, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to St. Jude's hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a pretty serious dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I think the audience was right
to jump on you a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave to the kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, like I said, RIP.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, kind of like the cancer research
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Star Delta.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always, uh, worried about those.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of, you'd have to have an
incredible team of people in charge of
[SPEAKER_07]: raising money and distributing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Accurately.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be something that just seems
like human nature would be, you'd really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really, really, really have to watch that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, think about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about how much of a good person you
must've been to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause how many companies out there
actually can grossly pull in two billion
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars, let alone make two billion.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying to give it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying to collect it, stack it,
stamp it, certify it and give it away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you got to realize St. Jude's
hospital doesn't charge families.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're accepted there, it's covered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I donate to them too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have as well, because you know,
they're, they're at the forefront.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're literally at the spear tip of
helping and definitely pushing things on a
[SPEAKER_08]: level that, uh, uh, you know, Osher and
all kinds of other four, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: forefront, um, hospitals are doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really needed because these are,
it's to see kids suffering is horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bad enough seeing adults suffering,
but seeing kids suffering is, yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: it, it, it, yeah, it wreaks us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's everybody in the soul.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely fucked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, our, uh, we got to send a shout
out to forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: We invited him today and he hasn't been
able to come because Silas had a bad night
[SPEAKER_07]: last night and he's not doing too well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll put our thoughts and prayers
with, uh, with those guys and all
[SPEAKER_07]: suffering children everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're definitely, uh, it's a, it's a
terrible thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: For kids to be born with some of these,
uh, diseases and some of these obstacles
[SPEAKER_07]: that, uh, you just can't really fathom or
imagine yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, some of them come out of, you know,
live throughout these experiences with
[SPEAKER_07]: such strength, uh, that it's very
inspirational.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cost, the hidden costs of the
caregivers and those that have to take
[SPEAKER_08]: care of those such as forest that
sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I watched him multiple posts,
uh, you know, over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have different things, you know,
they plan to attend, but now that changes
[SPEAKER_08]: because everything becomes the most,
uh, important is the child then in that
[SPEAKER_08]: situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's they sacrifice so much for their
kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So much love and respect there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he was saying last time for us was
saying that the divorce rate is 87% for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, parents of these
catastrophically ill children.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just what's notated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's probably even higher than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you know how, you know, if they're
rich, they're not reaching everybody in
[SPEAKER_08]: those statistics.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Wade came in, but he never,
I can't sell.
[SPEAKER_07]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he showed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, Wade?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hear you just wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you were talking about forest and
Silas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really had a rough week, um,
couple hours a night of, uh, when Silas
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't sleep seizing and, uh, Silas was
supposed to start school this week and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't believe he's made it to class yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for my late joining this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just had a busy day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Glad you made it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to be going to too much
longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a pretty chill, chill day,
but definitely want to build a good
[SPEAKER_07]: audience and a big, a good group for the,
uh, the 150, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be, I guess it's a 52, 52 and 52.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 156 episodes, it'll be in four
episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have a nice, a nice gathering in
here where we can have like 20 or 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_07]: panelists come through over the course of
the four hours and just really organize a
[SPEAKER_07]: cool little conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe even have some people like Naya
Hawkins on, uh, you know, who was on an
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier episodes, get Samantha Envy or
Elvie back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you do a 50, 50 panel,
women and men, like, uh, do a rotational,
[SPEAKER_05]: like how you had the, uh, the ladies came
running.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They crushed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 men and 20 women.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they would help organize it too,
because the way that went was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the only way you're going to get
like, you know, the way they were,
[SPEAKER_05]: they just came a little bit more organized
than us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were very organized.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't organize the dudes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like impossible, but she,
she, Natasha's like, I sent out emails,
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent out messages.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a CNN panel where it was like
everyone had the exact same shot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: exact shoulder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know all keyed in the exact lighting was
good for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had all perfect sound and it was
like, and it was in and out, in and out,
[SPEAKER_05]: in and out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like just boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom panel live feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just absolutely insanity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like not just a little bit different
than us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean noticeably more organized,
noticeably huge props.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, they were very impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I learned a lot yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to execute any of what I
learned.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like, I feel like we've been
making like mashed potatoes and ribs and
[SPEAKER_05]: they came in and like, we're like serving
mashed potatoes and ribs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having our barbecue every weekend
and they came in and like just boom,
[SPEAKER_05]: moose pies and like different types of
meats and like jerk chickens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know, you're just like,
wow, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: They came out with a five-star catering
while we were busting out the hot dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, yeah, I've made some mashed
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, yeah, and that time we made
three different types of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or to quote Tony V, they were,
we were playing, we were playing checkers
[SPEAKER_05]: and they were playing chess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can, if you, if we can
incorporate that for the, for the 200
[SPEAKER_05]: episode, at least 50% there, boom,
you know, just always kind of,
[SPEAKER_05]: that would be an interesting panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Male, female, male, female.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, is that, was that a Jerry Lewis thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: My homage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I've got half the chat mad at me
because Tony fucking jumped on me for,
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't jump on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just, I'm just bugging you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not mad at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, how about two star dog?
[SPEAKER_07]: Two star dog says porn star chicks would
be cool mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they wouldn't trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: They would not be cool at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was cool was the panel that we had.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit was rocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: A genius.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a little clip for you, for your
Jerry Lewis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to put it on YouTube and get
my shit blocked?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like it's, it's not a monetized
video with commercials on the front of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a CNN video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, then don't show it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not going to show it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to share the link for you
to share the link.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little homage, a little thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put it in the chat right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you have a little thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Copy and slap it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone deserves some respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he deserves respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ever hear that Peter Tosh song,
honorary citizen, Google that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't so good song and it's not
sung by Peter Tosh, but it is a song about
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Tosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a chill one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, uh, I think I'm going to call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, uh, I got lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: To do today still.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a busy Sunday and there's a blue sky
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to thank everyone for
coming out and hanging out for a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some longer than others.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wade made it in at the end, but we'll see
him again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe next week we'll have them in and
hopefully forest can come in and tell us a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe dr. Natasha will be back and dr.
Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, thanks everyone for
watching hash church this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week for a episode one
53.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
