[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, Ballman here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful snowy day here in British
Columbia once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thought I would do a little bit of a dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, pulled out the dry sift table.
[SPEAKER_01]: The great gardener, Matt, was here
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: He dropped off some canatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice big bag of sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty clean, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not terrible, terrible quality,
but a little bit puffy when you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag smoke like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get the sift floating in the air,
there's a lot of stuff in there that's
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty soft, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take this and we're going
to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm using only the single clean
screen right now, I've also got my little
[SPEAKER_01]: Fieldmaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about a 500 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to do with that is I'm
going to drop a little bit of hash in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And push it through with the card so when
it falls onto this screen, it's just nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and even for me and I can use the card to
sort of card back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow's falling on my screen right now,
so we're going to have to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so, hey, I guess I'm going to go
get my card.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll come in handy today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically was unable to film in the
other situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The snow is literally, the line is right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the wind picks up, it comes in
and it goes on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although I want to be outside for you
guys, I have to pick my position well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically this is just another quick
little dry sifting video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys have seen me do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great gardener came and dropped off some
Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably about a couple ounces here,
two or three ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my single 70 micron screen that
we're going to be carding over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lately, instead of just dropping some
of the resin down, what I've been doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using my little Fieldmaster,
which is a 250 to 500 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular one's 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just put a tiny little bit of the
Kanatonic in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want to be working too
much at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got a piece of cardboard,
two pieces of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big kind of silly one is just to keep
the one that I've put down from getting
[SPEAKER_01]: wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got an actual flat piece of
cardboard that fits my screen perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically using the iTunes card that
Mr. Darren taught us about, we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to gently push this through the 500
micron screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can already see a ton of hairs,
things gathering on this screen that
[SPEAKER_01]: basically should stay out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite something actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I can show you guys what
we're left with there inside that little
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really see there's still some
heads in there, but the majority of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pistol of hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a couple more little balls
of sift on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to push the hairs through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more gentle you are, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then usually at the end, I just bang
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in this corner here and that's
sort of like my somewhat contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost all hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite a little effective tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a little blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of red hairs in this
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to definitely be something else
to fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to card this resin
back and forth gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a nice big card, we're going to be
pushing all these little pistol of hairs
[SPEAKER_01]: and pistol of hairs and stigmas and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be pushing them right
through this screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you a little bit of a closer look.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so give you a little bit of a
closer look.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see here how that crumbled up
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to kind of work these larger hairs
out of our pile and get left with
[SPEAKER_01]: something along these lines to card the
resin back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, when we're carding the
resin back and forth, we're creating
[SPEAKER_01]: friction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to keep your card clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it get dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And try to keep the pieces that you clean
out of your card over to the side because
[SPEAKER_01]: any little things that don't want to go
through are only going to interrupt and
[SPEAKER_01]: cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be carding here for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come back when we can show you what
we've got left on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we have quite a bit of red
hair in this stigmas, pistolets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've done is I've put my 220 on
top of my 500, my 250, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm doing is just a real light
sifting to try and catch those hairs
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's quite a few of them and
they're making it very hard carding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the two whacked together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really gentle sort of,
you can see it falling nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give it a little one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even card or gently brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this is doing is it's leaving
the red hairs on top of the tighter
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them, don't get me wrong,
a lot are still going through because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not being overly gentle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see as I give it the whack,
you can see that gold color disappearing
[SPEAKER_01]: and more of that red color, orangey color
of the hairs appearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice light, lightly dust here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of contaminant, a lot of stigmas and
pistolet hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's as simple as just being very
gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, push those heads through.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the balls are breaking up as I do
this gentle process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a little whack, bring it down and
we'll see we're at about 90% of stigmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can't zoom in on that and
show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very contaminated as opposed to this stuff
here that we're about to card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this here has been already carded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're making headway.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so just doing the light to
screen, gently brushing through the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see I'm getting a lot of the red
hairs out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, I've got a couple of
clean piles here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I've done is stacked the 250 and the
500.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just been gently brushing the
resin through this screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've piled up a bunch of red hairs here,
which you can see there's quite a few of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how much cleaner I'm going to
try to get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's producing a lot of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's making for difficult cleaning to
say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll just put all of this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still quite a bit of glands in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually gone a little more golden
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see on the bottom of this
screen, it's about to release the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get carding these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get my little bit off here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a little of those hairies out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll start carding this and we'll get
back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going through real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see, once you get, once it goes
through so nice and you get this real nice
[SPEAKER_01]: color, you can kind of move that on up to
this other worked pile here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to keep doing the same
thing, gently carding through the
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, I'll lift the screen and
I'll show you what's on the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep on it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pushing the golden color through and
eventually getting left with mostly just
[SPEAKER_01]: the red hairs, the stigmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them on the brush and a lot of
them contaminating the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep this as clean as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult with these little
guys, but nothing a little, nothing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little brush won't fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
So
[SPEAKER_01]: super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to keep your tools clean
when you're using tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the bubble box screens for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly use these because they're metal
and it just seemed to make sense today
[SPEAKER_01]: while I'm doing this that it be as cold as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the tray of the nicely
lightly sifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just get that card out and we
will once again, card the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of an extra thing I'm
adding here in order to remove these red
[SPEAKER_01]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, just finishing up this can of
Tonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've managed to clean the hairs out and
I'm slowly cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of piles of heads on top
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sort of did a better version on
these ones than those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's going to be still,
I mean really these are basically the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, carded on top of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the screen is the majority of what
was in this bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go for the last of what was in
this bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dump that right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea to get resin on your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean it off gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some gentle, gentle, gentle brushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be some gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically this is a method I've been
using to clean out red hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use this method all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular batch for whatever reason
was just covered in little stigmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to clean this pile at the end
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if we can't run these through the
screens gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a little bit here to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get these hairs out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a light little breath will take them
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just nice and gentle carding this resin
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see right away it pushes a lot
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get it clean, if you put it on
too dirty, these little stigmas,
[SPEAKER_01]: these little hairs, they're going to keep
it from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't take me too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basically what I've been doing the
whole time, going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can already see a nice color change
on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This color is already nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue on here and we'll
catch you guys in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gotten ourselves a couple of
piles here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my two carded piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I carded this one the longest and nicest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually like go with color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little microscope as well that I
can use and get down right in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: see this one was a pure, way pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went with carding today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working here for over an hour
and a half now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I managed to get was a giant pile
of cystalith stigma hairs, some,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say about 90% heads and then some 95
plus percent heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with carding, that's pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can lift up this little guy here,
go drop them off gently right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them out of the rain and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show you what the majority of
that material was because it was a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: big bag that we had going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you a little bit closer
so you can really see what we're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contamination wise, we got a decent amount
of it and this is definitely not for my
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably why there were so few
full-size heads in this Kanatana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect there's still a lot of heads in
here in the 45 to 50 micron range,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I managed to get out all the ones
above 70, which is what you can do as well
[SPEAKER_01]: with these screening techniques that I
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, you can
always reach me, bubbleman at bubblebag
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also on, you know, kick at BC
Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on my Facebook page at Bubbleman Fresh
Headies and yeah, we're easy to get in
[SPEAKER_01]: touch with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw the rest of that back into the
Kanatonic bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, always comes in handy if
you got your little brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that next level of cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really clean up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is contaminant, so it's not really as
important, but sometimes when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: picking up your pure headies, it's nice to
know that you're getting them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't weigh that at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could have, but no worries
because I can weigh it now and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the exact same weight all separated
into a few piles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pure headies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost pure headies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a nice little rip of some
pureness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big old pile of crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red hairs and crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is some heads in here that will
get one last run, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here we have complete and total
talcum powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just contaminant, just very little
hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our number one grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our number two grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get the actual light
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a decent quality right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty clear with heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is our second grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our third right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the talcum powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even worse than the talcum
powder, we have what I'd call our fourth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was an extra process that I had
to do just to clean this schwag out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's in your dry sift people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your dry sift's got that edge to it,
you got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so there's the can of tonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, and four.
And that's it.
