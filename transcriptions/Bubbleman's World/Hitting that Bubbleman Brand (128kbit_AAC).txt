[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here in Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got Eggy just off camera here,
the master grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna do a little review today,
actually, here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lucky enough to find some Bubble Man
brand lemon remedy, three to one
[SPEAKER_01]: turprosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one first place at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, which I guess they kind of
announced after they had already announced
[SPEAKER_01]: the first winners that ended up getting
disqualified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great job on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Versura killing it with the half gram
of lemon remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also gonna hit some flower
turprosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a half gram of dog walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower turprosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you a little, this stuff is just
absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it focuses on the right thing
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going up on YouTube, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little sour tangy as well from
Blue River Terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might be doing a little bit of a
turp dip as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have to find my dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, grabbed my dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to start with some lemon
remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looks so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three to one turprosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff is absolutely stew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pendis did a really great job on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to cut me out here and get this into
the nice close up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's do a little dab here on the
three to one, the lemon remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Tony will be able to come out as
well in a little bit and give you guys a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of background on the lemon
remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How he went about preparing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, for now, I'm going to give you
my thoughts on it out of the Klein
[SPEAKER_01]: Mothership here in Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells nice in the air too, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you were lucky enough to be one
of the people down in Cali that was able
[SPEAKER_01]: to locate some of this, as I don't believe
that there any drops were actually made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just kind of got traded out
amongst close people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really incredible taste on this
lemon remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's getting a little dark out here
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you guys a little bit of view just to
show you what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's T-Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just doing a little video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just hitting the lemon remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought maybe you could come on
camera and talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But feel free to take a couple pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to come back over here and
maybe hit the dog walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you want to come over and just
give us a few words on each one,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice head space on that three to
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unique, different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not what I'm hitting on the
regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, this dog walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the dog walker is the Chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chem 91 with the Albert Walker Kush.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last of the emerald orchards.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get this up.
Ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hole rip, hole rip gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even go back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how it works sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're trying to fix the camera,
you drop in dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so dog walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terp oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one was in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 percentile with 15, 15 plus,
15, 20 percent turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had you tried that one yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that your first time hitting it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reminds me of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ranky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice little sunset here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think you should just maybe
take yourself a little rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take a little rip of the dog
walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog walker is right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then do lemon remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lemon remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the lemon remedy was the one that
ended up going for first at the emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't 100 percent sure, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delayed reaction, you know, like a month
or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they were I guess you got
to respect the fact they'd go back and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're trying to live to the
standards of their competition,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether things were entered under
different understandings or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was distillates were disqualified
and anyone that failed pesticides or
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial was also disqualified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our lemon remedy was a three to one
CVDA to THCA and and also had like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, 11 percent terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like kind of a three to one to
one.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three to one to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice headspace on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, of course, been driving around the
city all day in downtown Kingston,
[SPEAKER_01]: going to banks and lawyers offices and all
these different things, getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, dotting the I's and crossing the
T's for cannabinoid research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's our last night here tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to enjoy just enjoyed
the sunset, seeing the city slowly light
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear our other partners just arrived
down by the pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're up on the deck right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured I'd just do a short little
video today.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I want to add on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lemon remedy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that patent that just came out
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of actually fits the the mold
for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a chemo type two drug cultivar that
is high CBD, low THC, very, very little
[SPEAKER_02]: low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mercy, but high limonene, high limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not that cherry traditional
cherry taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those that went to the Emerald Cup
that came by the Harborside booth was able
[SPEAKER_02]: to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had people hitting me up that were lucky
enough to try it and saying, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, superb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always good when it gets back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to hear people are happy with the
end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, you know, it's not one of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a brand that's easily
represented.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just throw anything together for
the Bubble Man brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has to be that special special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was also 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good that we kind of got some stuff
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's definitely some people like,
oh, why don't you make more of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just one of those things where
it's like you've got to have a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank God, knock on wood, 2016,
we got through in 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have a full-blown Bubble Man lab
that will be in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll probably see a lot of
collaborations, white labels, but the tech
[SPEAKER_02]: itself and the facility, kind of like your
certification and our certification on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017 is excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a saying, big tings,
big tings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people always like to say that
each time a new year starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big tings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't said it myself in a while,
but I can definitely say that 2017 has
[SPEAKER_01]: started off pretty sweet and it's looking
to be, it's looking to be a good year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get some of that lemon remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hit the lemon remedy, puff us out on
this short Kingston video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We end up being so busy, we don't have a
lot of time to spend in front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera and make videos for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know you guys like to get a peek
when and where you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work from 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonstop every day for meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little time, so I figured we'd,
well, it's the first time I hit these
[SPEAKER_01]: gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon remedy and dog walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lemon remedy is just so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a true blueberry Afghani cross from a
buddy named Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, like I say it over and over,
you know, you can't make good resin
[SPEAKER_02]: products, extracts, if you will,
from bad grown.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for a while people thought that
extracting was creating quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they slowly realized that
extracting is actually unveiling whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: happens to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just unveiling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, I mean, in a sense,
you do make the appearance of it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better because you're smoking a much purer
product and it affects you in a more
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really all you do is an extract or a
hash maker is you unveil the quality that
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and the grower have already,
you know, spent months working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the beginning, you know,
we were just kind of pressing flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like you can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you take this particular lemon
remedy, it almost grows like a very
[SPEAKER_02]: naughty, almost like an OG, a little bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got kind of the pine cone shape to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked him, you know, don't trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hang it, cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as it starts to bend,
you know, and just barely snap off,
[SPEAKER_02]: then go ahead and cut it right into
directly into a Turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was cured cold for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say a good month and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trichomes in a sense, that last bit
of the curing we did in the freezer,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in a cold, dry environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did like kind of a fresh cure,
kind of snapped off and kept it really
[SPEAKER_02]: cold for a month and then press that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, E?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chillin, chillin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just finishing up a little video for
Bubblegans World.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ernie who just walked in,
one of our partners from United Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, how was your day, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the pictures, you bastard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come all the time and you're
like, it's Kingston and it's Montego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck in a little turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to, you never get to enjoy
like what, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So walking with Miss Joy that owns the
property was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I saw all kinds of spots that I'm
sure Dave would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I saw just a few pictures that you
took and it was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: The waterfall, the blue hole, the river,
the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just all completely
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's like the other property we
were, uh, we were on helping these guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, uh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: A two acre fish pond?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create the own fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, each one was an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one was an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's a five year, project,
right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just drain it, dig the fish
emulsion and put the fish back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first crop in Jamaica with CRD will
be done that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine how much the plants would
like that blue water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it looks so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know how much you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much like Disney world that I had
to walk out and touch the rocks to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they weren't cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it looks like the British
built a dam here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, that's real rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a blue hole there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a water hole that went into
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I thought those are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every like 25 yards was another waterfall
on another water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I would love to do some eco
tourism here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, we could build Dave one of
those tiny houses right here on this right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tiny house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just a tease for you guys out
there in bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will, uh, try to give you better
updates in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to be quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we're working on things, you know,
Jamaica can be a chatty chatty place,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, you'll hear more from us in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: So peace out from the CRD and you can
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
