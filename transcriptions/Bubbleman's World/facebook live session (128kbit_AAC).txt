[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live Facebooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I guess I can just do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Building an audience for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how wonderful is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being so kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook Live and building an audience for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure wouldn't be quite the same sitting
here and talking to nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: For being a part of this little... This
little... Whatever this is that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This little live Facebook chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Josh Corpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome, Etienne Fontaine and Stevie
Hughes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if that isn't a great fucking group
of first four or five people that walked
[SPEAKER_02]: in into the room, that's sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have a session with Josh,
Etienne, and Stevie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three of my off Facebook friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for showing up, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Durbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got my D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, I was wearing my shirt the
other day and the one that you guys sent
[SPEAKER_02]: me that said, everybody wants the D.
[SPEAKER_02]: The D-nail, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go to the beach and I sit next to
this old woman and I end up talking to her
[SPEAKER_02]: about her cancer and she's got neuropathy
and I'm telling her about cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the middle of talking to her about
cannabis as a medicine, she says,
[SPEAKER_02]: what does your shirt say?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, everybody needs the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just say D-nail even though it doesn't
say D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just says D, like this giant big
fucking D in the middle of my chest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they were... She was like,
oh, oh, everybody needs the D.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit of a funny experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I'd pass that on and give you a
little laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, shout out from Cultist Lake,
Aristotle's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fun at Cultist Lake to be had,
that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring my boat out there one day and shred
it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, you can't make this shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome, Joseph O'Connor,
bubble ambassador in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of our representatives for the
bubble man brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for it in your shops,
you can always get in touch with Joseph O
[SPEAKER_02]: 'Connor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usain Bolt, making Jamaica proud in the
Olympics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever met him?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Cody Dondi, I met Usain one time
on dirt bikes and he was on quads with a
[SPEAKER_02]: few guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never really got off and took our
helmets off, but I was told later that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was Usain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had bought quads for all his friends
and they rip up the backside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain there up the Blue Mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was on the quads.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there, but we didn't really like
high-end bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Usain Bolt, so maybe in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome, Adam Holzowski.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love cool-old people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any updates on when you can legally get
into America?
[SPEAKER_02]: Still waiting on sending in my waiver,
so soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Jean-Marc Larros from Montreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Salut, mon ami.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaican tour dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any updates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Still waiting, Kane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta wait for Jamaica to take off with
my business before I start another
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you already tried Vriptec vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Vriptec I got turned on to in
the late 90s, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Steve-O, shout out Winnipeg,
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dab, shall we, on that Winnipeg,
Manitoba note?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got no volume?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Strawberry Banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flour Rosin from Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys hear?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get one guy saying that he can't hear,
and then I worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just his audio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super fucking tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit is fiza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost gone, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: About to, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry that you can't hear, Jim,
but good that everyone else can hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much appreciated to know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the cameras work like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the cameras do mirrors,
and that's why everything's backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by all means, if you want it to be
right side up, go stand in front of a
[SPEAKER_02]: mirror, and hold your phone up,
and you'll see it all the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was a little mirror button I
could just push to make that right,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I alas can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well good, Dondi, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Cody, yeah, Cody Dondi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked away for your name for a second and
thought, am I calling him the right name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaning up the sapphire for the next dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six Star Hash Rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm guessing you're calling the hash
it was made with six star, as in six star
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble hash made into rosin, because rosin
itself has no star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that is is because rosin is
an oil, and oil is melty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all hash will melt, but all oil will
melt, because it's a liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already been melted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure exactly what you were
mentioning, but if you're calling it six
[SPEAKER_02]: star rosin, then it should be made with
six star bubble, because rosin itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: once again, does not have a star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indra has been an incredible addition to
Hash Church, although I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_02]: he is now worried that since he showed the
liquid nitrogen trick, that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to hurt themselves with liquid
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very worried about giving away
information and people turning around and
[SPEAKER_02]: harming themselves because he did it with
BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, the majority of people
who are making BHO, when I say the
[SPEAKER_02]: majority, I'm talking about 99.5%,
are not doing it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not doing the BHO properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not following his patent properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's little things that he does
within his chamber that moves the material
[SPEAKER_02]: around and gets higher yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's different things in regards to
how the chamber sits and how he uses the
[SPEAKER_02]: gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: To cool the reaction down and all of these
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's seriously on his conscience,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He feels so bad about this BHO thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's happy that it's helping people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's brutally remorseful in the sense that
people have died from it and blown up and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome MC West to the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I saw someone else just pop in
that I recognize, but now I've forgotten
[SPEAKER_02]: their name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, quite a few people want to license
his patent and you're welcome to get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in touch with me and I'll sort you out
and get you in touch with the right folks
[SPEAKER_02]: in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been a little bit crazy right
now as I'm working out all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: different licensing deals myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for BHO, albeit, but different,
you know, the water extraction patent,
[SPEAKER_02]: some dry sift intellectual properties from
Sam, as well as from Indra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm also trying to organize myself to
make sure that at least my own companies
[SPEAKER_02]: are taken care of and I'm able to do the
work that I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously, right as I sign and
seal my deals, I will pass Indra on to
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone that requests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Scaldone, who was at the top of the
list, was very worried that I wasn't going
[SPEAKER_02]: to pass his information on, but it's just
been... I spoke with Indra today for two
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful, amazing conversations and I'm
actually calling him here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel blessed to have him in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he contacted me a long time ago
and he told me that he was this guy that
[SPEAKER_02]: created this method and that if I could
help him go online and tell people what
[SPEAKER_02]: the wrong things were that they were
doing, it became... Because I tried to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that, I became very biased in the eyes of
everyone because I was selling a product
[SPEAKER_02]: and they thought I was just trying to put
down BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to put down any extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any process that produces beautiful,
high quality resins, I'm in full support
[SPEAKER_02]: of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just never been in full support of
everyone doing something that's dangerous
[SPEAKER_02]: and not understanding the ramifications of
exploding at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit and
[SPEAKER_02]: burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's why Indra and I have
gotten along all these years when he
[SPEAKER_02]: started telling me these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't give a shout out to Sam the Skunk
Man, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back and read that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember typing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that threw me off a little bit
in my conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's time for another dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would always give Skunk Man Sam Oh my
God, he's the original OG mentor that
[SPEAKER_02]: deserves all of my praise and will always
have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now as a friend, I'm in a different
situation as he's a friend and I try not
[SPEAKER_02]: to blow smoke up my friend's asses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a mentor, I would really try to
never forget Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew I was going to forget Ron Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will definitely go back and edit it if
it's not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll look after this video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey bro, what temp you dab at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I'm dabbing at 590.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some pretty low temp dabs, some pretty
light colored rosin, flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's still working Stevie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see my little?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still working perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, John, he didn't really give
directions properly as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just sharing something he knew was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But enough of the larger companies have
contacted me in regards to getting in
[SPEAKER_02]: touch with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully some of those guys work
something out with them and they figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out that they can be more efficient and
they can be safer and they can lease his
[SPEAKER_02]: patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's certainly not a greedy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he would be very reasonable with
companies that want to lease his patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he's already sort of expressed
that he has no interest in putting
[SPEAKER_02]: companies out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll tell you, I have faith in the man
when he says that his extractions are much
[SPEAKER_02]: more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in full belief that that's the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look forward to seeing all these
different processes that he's got going
[SPEAKER_02]: once I can sign these NDAs and get them
out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you keep your nail in the middle
clean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I dab so low that oil gets down in there
and clogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't got a D now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a D now.
[SPEAKER_02]: My nail is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that clean, but it's a big
sapphire dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: How I clean it is I unplug it from the
Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I plug it into the Dnail 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dnail 2.0 is set at 1,000 degrees and
the Dabinator is set at 578, 580.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my thoughts are that I'm not overly
bummed out about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're allowing Canadians to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people, so-called activists that had
MMR licenses, were so worried about losing
[SPEAKER_02]: their license, they were just hoping that
they would get grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was more along the lines that I was
unaccepting of any type of grandfathering
[SPEAKER_02]: in and that we would obviously have to
fight for everyone's rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: To grow cannabis, not just a few people
that may have gotten a license in during a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Drew Robertson, Kevin Blais,
Jason Thomas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeling pretty iry after my second rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still waiting to pop into this bubble
hash, this Kushberry exclusive private
[SPEAKER_02]: stash from Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just, I can't smell it,
but I know it's going to be extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: special because when I open this
strawberry banana, even still,
[SPEAKER_02]: the paper, this parchment paper,
smells better than most people's half
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Tom, you know, that's an impossible
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always favorites, but really,
it's just a matter of pick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Angel R.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonzalez, Blackler Jacket Russells,
Ethan Bagley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap!
[SPEAKER_02]: There's my boy, probably up in Pemberton
or Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming to town, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to be there from the 20th to the
27th, so I hope to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even come check out your spot in
Pemberton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my bike that I'll bring on the
trailer, so if you got anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, maybe I'll even pull the boat up
there and we could take it up to Anderson
[SPEAKER_02]: Lake and have some fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Samuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's on the straw-nana tip lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, it's a super, super very loud
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I get my Concentrated X?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I get my Concentrated X from
Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Fletch is always doing it up right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great selector and breeder and hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put insurance on your bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bringing my bike up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an off-road bike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take it into the bush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Justin Tiller.
[SPEAKER_02]: My butane isn't a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use butane, and I'm sure the
people that fight for butane oil will have
[SPEAKER_02]: no problem changing Health Canada's minds,
especially someone like Indra who could
[SPEAKER_02]: come in and show the proper standard
operating procedures with everything done
[SPEAKER_02]: properly in proper rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already being done in Canada with
food products, so I don't think that the
[SPEAKER_02]: right people would have a hard time
showing them where they made their
[SPEAKER_02]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I more align the lines of showing the
solventless methods, so I'll be doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: water and doing the rosin and doing the
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my focuses, but I'm sure that
people who are very believing in the gas
[SPEAKER_02]: methods like Indra will fight for those
methods to be allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as it stands, I think it makes sense
that they don't allow those products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way someone like Indra,
for say, could come in and build a lab and
[SPEAKER_02]: get it done, then it would make perfect
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a matter of cannabis,
once again, catching up with the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: the world, all of these machines,
all of these methods, extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: processes, shakers, everything already
exists in the agricultural world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that we're in the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is this information
trickles down into the cannabis world and
[SPEAKER_02]: people kind of get it right, kind of get
it wrong, and they build their little
[SPEAKER_02]: worlds, which we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now those worlds are getting to be too
big for the community that we were in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see we're cracking and
breaking into this mainstream world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are going to become more
agricultural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are going to become a little closer
together rather than divided.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we can bring that wall down,
well, we'll be able to plant cannabis the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it was supposed to be planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to plant it outdoors in
fields, and we'll be able to process
[SPEAKER_02]: mountains and mountains of the raw
product, which will then be able to be
[SPEAKER_02]: turned into all sorts of different
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think it's going to be a
welcome change for the majority of the
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be the craft sort
of cannabis growers, the smaller people
[SPEAKER_02]: that pay more attention to things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that they're both going to be
definitely both well-received in this
[SPEAKER_02]: upcoming economy that cannabis is blooming
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, you know, Nick, I'm just going
to make another great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plan is that every time I mention a
plan, people don't show up, people flake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't mention plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told Rob Clark that a couple of
weeks ago on Hash Church when he was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of whining a little bit about the way that
it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that he would rather be
scheduled in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, man, I'll schedule you in no
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to let me know in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem I have generally with
scheduling people in is that they fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: flake every time I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have I heard, have I tried any of Matt
Rice's hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing okay, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: As John Dee was saying on GiveawaySJ,
growing is a full-time job when done
[SPEAKER_02]: right, all on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to grow our medicine then and only
then will we really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, it's not really realistic
for everyone to do, you know, grow their
[SPEAKER_02]: own medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's reasonable for some and
it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some, it's just completely not
reasonable to try and grow their own
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it's important that we
should always be allowed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea of everyone growing their own
is just not realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, do you grow all your
own food?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you make all your own clothes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, you know, like all of these other
things in life, we have industries that we
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, and it's another funny thing
actually about when people slam down big
[SPEAKER_02]: corporations because I almost guarantee
your phone and the computer screen you're
[SPEAKER_02]: on right now and your television and where
you buy your groceries and your clothes
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these other things are giant
corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are just freaked out about it with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're freaked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, ah, you don't want to
support those big corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're wearing Levi's jeans and,
you know, Mark's work warehouse shirt with
[SPEAKER_02]: a forum hat and iPhone in your hand,
I think I always will want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm telling you right now,
if I could just go and buy at a very
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable price, full melt sifts and
rosins and dry and water hashes and all
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of extractions and
products for really, really great prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I'd be, I'd be all over that right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growing your own is more realistic
because the ex the insane, insane price
[SPEAKER_02]: that people pay for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we slam pharmaceutical companies
for overcharging for their drugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really not too different for charging
the amount of money that this fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: plant sells for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's because of prohibition as
well as greed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two combinations make for very
expensive pot and make it good pot or
[SPEAKER_02]: great pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems to even be more of a reason
to be like, well, you're going to pay like
[SPEAKER_02]: 600 for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's a great price?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's reasonable pennies on the gram and
dollars on the grams for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people could afford.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to use a gram a day and you
know, or even more than it can't be a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred dollars a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 3000 fucking dollars a month,
which is $30,000 a year just for,
[SPEAKER_02]: just for your cannabis resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's unreasonable to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cost any more to grow than
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the prohibition that has jacked the
price up and it's what people love about
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even in this legal flip where it's
going to be legal now, people still don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get rid of that prohibition
dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, well, people are used to
paying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just keep it up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Ooh, I'll tell you,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cody Dondie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only on a few occasions Chandler like
twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then insurance and then insurance
insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, yeah, I don't even like to
compare alcohol and cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like a comparing,
you know, teddy bears and grenades.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one is soft and cuddly and one
will blow your fucking head off.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a crazy thing to constantly bring
cannabis into the comparison of alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: when alcohol is a killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope here in Canada, we're,
we're slowly but surely crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Hilary Black comes into the room,
the, you know, one of the, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leading activists in my opinion,
from day one and all of this, who actually
[SPEAKER_02]: has an integrity, a very pretty fucking
like bulletproof one, I might add.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's my favorite Dino piece?
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite Dino piece is the Sapphire
bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was jealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You Salt Spring Islander.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was seeing that your post and was like,
Oh, there's a Salt Spring Island
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to put the boat in and just hit
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jason, A because it'll get the
price, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will get the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because also no one else is really
producing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If all of a sudden tons of other people
had that same product and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you, if you look at why it's
expensive, it's because they're comparing
[SPEAKER_02]: it to the price they need to get of what
their herb is worth and what, how much
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on the prices of the market,
which I don't care how much people want to
[SPEAKER_02]: say we've, we've, we've organized cannabis
to a point where it's almost legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prices are the same as prohibition,
if not worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love for anyone to tell me
that I'm wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dispensary or LP or whatever isn't
selling cannabis for as expensive as you
[SPEAKER_02]: ever paid in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Hugo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Hugo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugo was a 32 ounce haze plant that Ron
and I grew back in the day in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was straight amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a land race sativa or narrow leaf
drug cultivar, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_02]: it, that I'll just never forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally why I named my son his
middle name haze was basically because of
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It filled up the whole back of the truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cody Dandy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too much about owning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just my Taurus is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my mothership Taurus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit so much glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still impossible to say what my
favorite is.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite is usually whatever is about
approaching my lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks, James.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much appreciated, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel so bad for my son.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Block Michael Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel bad for my son.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives a blessed life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's about the happiest little fucking
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've ever met in your life and he brings
joy to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He communicates and opens discussions at
two years old with complete and total
[SPEAKER_02]: strangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very enamored with people and he's
got a wonderful vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just have to say, see you later,
Michael, you troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry to hear Justin while you're back
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, FlavsFTK, which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Uber?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all hit so lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, my favorite hash,
my favorite this, my favorite that is
[SPEAKER_02]: usually the one that's approaching my
lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually the one that is my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's always that one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I have a couple of sons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure one day they'll be seen if
they decide to be, you know, it's up to
[SPEAKER_02]: them and it's their decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but how is it made and what's the
quality and are there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mercapitines and heavy metal contaminants
or mystery oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's another worry I have about
people selling BHO as medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be really careful with that,
especially with the knowledge that Indra's
[SPEAKER_02]: laying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, make sure you're covering all
your bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Dry Sift or Good Bubble?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry Sift or Great Bubble are both my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have as well, Tom McCluskey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been absolutely, no, I have a
daughter as well, Grace.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely do have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was my first, in fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first was a girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have three children and very happy with
all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They teach me much about life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look at it as me being their
teacher so much as them being my teacher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too sure, Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Indra's his own man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll drop what he feels like dropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of a character that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure regardless of it, he's going to
come back and talk about liquid nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: because he phoned me right after and he
was like, you know, I talked about liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen and that way of combining oil
with trichome heads and making temple
[SPEAKER_02]: balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a little bit worried that people
are going to hurt themselves with liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen, i.e.
[SPEAKER_02]: not understanding how important it is to,
say, wear safety equipment around liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it in sandals because if you
dropped liquid nitrogen on your foot,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would fucking burn you so badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing even with shoes with
laces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could get through and roll through
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably pretty important for him
to come first and talk about safety
[SPEAKER_02]: precautions handling liquid nitrogen
because he is worried that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to hurt themselves doing that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's kind of an awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't give him enough props,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying, Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to so, you know, when he comes on
this week, whether he shares his secret or
[SPEAKER_02]: not, because he's told me, look,
before I share another secret,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to give people like proper how to
handle these things because I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: myself tracking down that stuff just to
mix my hash and oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, liquid nitrogen is not that hard to
track down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, once you see people doing
it, you may very well change your mind in
[SPEAKER_02]: regards to the product that is being
produced is going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different than hash and a little bit
different than oil being because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: both.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have a little bit of a
different profile that will produce
[SPEAKER_02]: different medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think once you see a few people
rocking it out, I myself, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it with some rosin and some dry sift as
well as some rosin and some bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: get some nice pictures, you know,
pass the medicine around to some patients
[SPEAKER_02]: and see how it differs from maybe the same
rosin or the same water hash, but being
[SPEAKER_02]: the two combined and combined in a very
unique way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you do something cold with
cannabis, you're better off than doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to crack that back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to crack it into the right unit before
I take my dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about carbonite?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good enough to freeze hand solo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, fuck, give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come tell us about it in Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up for Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll come up for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll come up for what, Nick?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading so many different things
trying to keep track of this chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just do a little Google search,
Justin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's claimed not 99, but he's
claimed that he gets a very, very high
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage of heads, like over 80,
maybe 90, maybe even higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he has another process that he
uses to clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the liquid nitrogen will be in like
the next day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be on the quick quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The L-N.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, Justin, Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is your friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll tell you everything you need to know
for where you live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Gabriel T.
[SPEAKER_02]: Faroff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen The Melts claiming 99% on
their water hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not, but that's absurd and
ridiculous, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised they would make such a
claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was a real nice low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one felt more like around 450.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hitting that sapphire, Wayne.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have a dab, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start off slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Mike Waterman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, nice, Carter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure you'll feel great when you
come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to take a little break,
see where you sit, see how cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting your body, whether it be mental
or emotional or physical or... Everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Aristoteles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you guys all as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to read your words.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to do these live chats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy them quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem, Evan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually came from Jim Frere,
a chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he has a PhD in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much of that knowledge that I spit in that
question that you mentioned about lipid
[SPEAKER_02]: pneumonia came from Jim.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very articulate and very intelligent,
and it's always good to pass on great
[SPEAKER_02]: information like that and make sure...
Yeah, fucking A, I'm getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always great to pass on information
like that to people that are also looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for good information and want to
understand rather than assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much assumption going on in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried CBD, pure CBD, pure CBN,
pure CBG, pure THC, A, acid versions of
[SPEAKER_02]: all those things, but of course,
I've heated them all up and made them
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylate and had the non-acid version
as well with terpene modulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is kind of like Sam has mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the anti-high for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone like me and Sam, particularly,
we love the effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the strong effects of feeling
elevated or high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much going on with that with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of the opposite, takes that
feeling in the other direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very medicinal for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably even enjoyable recreationally for
some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for me, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's always easy for a
company that makes oil to say lipid
[SPEAKER_02]: pneumonia is not a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a lot harder to deny people
who suffer from it or whether it's lipid
[SPEAKER_02]: pneumonia or chronic bronchitis or a
different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been people who smoke chronic
amounts of oil who get these chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: bronchitis, who are affecting their lungs
in a deep way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense when you understand the
science of it, the way Jim spits it out
[SPEAKER_02]: with the polar, non-polar and semi-polar
components and the non-polar solvent
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving behind all the semi-polar and the
polar components and the polar and the
[SPEAKER_02]: semi-polar components acting as nucleation
points in the lungs and keeping those
[SPEAKER_02]: nauseous plant waxes from actually getting
deeper into the lungs where they could do
[SPEAKER_02]: damage and create these chronic
bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it makes a ton of sense and I
certainly wouldn't dismiss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it was an oil company telling me
that it didn't exist, I would probably
[SPEAKER_02]: dismiss them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I dismissed Jim Freire,
the chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, there's another one,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew a guy that had it and it freaked
him out and he sure didn't want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people who get it don't even want to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like blowing up in your lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really talk about it unless it
makes the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never hear people talking about how
they blew up unless it makes the paper
[SPEAKER_02]: because they don't want to promote that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want that to be a part of the
reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a mouthful, Grace.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I kind of did that in a sense to
let the person know who thought I was
[SPEAKER_02]: getting really high and I was no longer
able to articulate my message that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually still able to pull out some
language.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I think about V-nail vaporite?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too sure, Henry, what I think
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm way on the other side over in
Vancouver here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, kind of between Vancouver and
Whistler and it's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping on going and picking up my boat
later this afternoon so I can go out on
[SPEAKER_02]: the ocean and maybe do a nice live chat
with you guys there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a pretty long chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll hit this one up on YouTube and
we'll see if people enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should let you guys go unless there's
any more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do another one maybe later today
from the boat, if not tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a good call to do a couple of these
in between the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, of course, stay medicated,
Justin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay medicated, everyone, and thank you
guys for coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sharing your time with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can share the video, I appreciate
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel any stress, though,
if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble on.
Bye-bye.
