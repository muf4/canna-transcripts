[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we're just pulling the 25
micron here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking its time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty soupy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he moves it around with the spoon
there, you see there's still quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try the vacuum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt brought over the vacuum, the shop
vac, the rona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to stick it into the
bottom of the bucket here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through this little hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see if we can't suck
the air bubbles and the extra water out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignition!
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have success, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very successful.
That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you run the spoon through there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to show them that that is like... I
mean, it was almost too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost pulled it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so when doing this, you don't want
to do it quite that hard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use water and clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wipe off the initial amount with
the spoon and then we'll use a little bit
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of water to pull it back into
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're going to have to use a
little bit of horsepower next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite efficient though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we poured a tiny little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to show you that we didn't muck it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to bring the vacuum back
over and we're going to suck this water
[SPEAKER_00]: out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't seal it quite as well this time and
we'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now try to get that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that worked pretty darn well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet if we used a sharper tool,
that's almost perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
