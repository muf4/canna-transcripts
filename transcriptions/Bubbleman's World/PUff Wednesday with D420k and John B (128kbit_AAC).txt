[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and more importantly, welcome to Puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this group of characters I have
behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amir is visiting in from Turkey,
Johnny B in from Abbotsford, and D420K in
[SPEAKER_01]: from Prince George.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know me, I'm from right here in Lion's
Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess today we're going to do a
quick little boat cruise.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are doing their ice cream and
their waters right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to basically cruise out to
the middle of the Sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's red tide right now, so I'd like to go
for a swim but not exactly in the red
[SPEAKER_01]: tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look for some dolphins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely going to see the elusive
pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that they're out here in the
middle of the Sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got a line on one,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll keep you guys informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday coming at you from the
Pacific Ocean today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace!
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man,
take you to the Sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man, take you to the Sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, help sounding it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvin Asher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amir, Nick John, John B.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about to get a lot quieter over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're heading over behind one of my
favorite islands, Boyer Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to be confused with Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the water's already getting
calmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soon as we get closer, it'll be very
calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we bring the kids for tubing
and water skiing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, this is where a lot of my
friends take their boats and go hang out
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of in the office, do computer work
and other sort of more boring things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to do in an office when
you've got yourself a little boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing today over there,
though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, we're going to go for a swim.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a pop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're definitely going for a pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's a pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're popping right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the red tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we cross it and get closer to the...
Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Might as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get to the nice green water over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the red tide, you guys.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, trust me, you're about to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all over.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very different ship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood red!
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole water is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood red!
[SPEAKER_04]: Slayer!
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, this is trippy, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffed all the way here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here in the nice, nice green colored
water here, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Still recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are in the zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the Howl Sound, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful red tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm not sure how much the camera's
picking that up, but we are surrounded by
[SPEAKER_01]: red tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the water we're in right now is
quite green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looks like Dee's getting ready to jump
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_01]: Scared the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The motherfucker almost put me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming to join you, you bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all jumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 420 jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, four, 20!
[SPEAKER_00]: There you guys go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday!
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_01]: John, quick, puff for us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm the camera guy today because I'm
not jumping in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all jump off the boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to throw John in as soon as we
get to the boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The boat's just going.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I'm jumping in the boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can swim back that way.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys going in again or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times with good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good hash on a beautiful fucking ocean on
a bluebird day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is... What do you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Torture beeline, he asks me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can do the beeline thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about your dabbitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I killed my video camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now finishing this video with the
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are still puffing like the
world is about to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty down with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to light this pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: John just put in the med-tainer in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to limp back over to where I
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Darren and I are going to hit the
bikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe John and Amir are going to follow us
in a vehicle to have some dinner and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: a CCHQ session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then back up to here to do a sunset on
the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already kind of promised my daughter
I'd take her water skiing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys, I think they want to come
back out on the boat, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red tide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait on, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's give you a little show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a good puff Wednesday when you
got lots of friends in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny's got a lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's world,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with Johnny B and D420K.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where the fuck are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the cauldron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess the new convention center is
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven Sails is over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right on the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Harbor Air behind us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in the middle of a pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tons of people are going to walk in
front of the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Harbor Center right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still going to share our hash flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have this meditation head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this a regular one, John?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would actually be the Dennis Hopper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis Hopper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice, dry taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it very nice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry pull is very tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry pull?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know what's very nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the dry pinching.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the best thing about it is when
you need to medicate, you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: medicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to medicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to medicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're doing here in the
super busiest part of Vancouver right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I said, no, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was going to say, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've got my name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just pull out my permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're supposed to smoke in public
probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice being a back cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: My road trip is just.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets a couple on that whole hash joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been at it for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've got another 10 days to ride my
bike onto the island, come about to
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come about to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hook up with John here and
take my first chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to come by.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to pop by.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to spend a day together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come crash today.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can come crash today any day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how I feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy, my bro, Chance, he has his
license and wants to get hooked up with
[SPEAKER_04]: the Compassion Clubs here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So John's going to take us around to all
facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To all of the good facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they have the best hash,
the best herb for medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the places where you can pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they're quite good about things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they help your pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are enjoying that, Doobie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the beautiful sun behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this gorgeous view behind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some city action right there,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're surrounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got planes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the mountains behind us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harbor Air, if you need to make a quick
trip to the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these planes will do the job for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hash joint, how's that treating you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's treating me really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm not passing it, it won't fall
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute I pass it, it'll be pinched and
fall apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Aaron called it by having you
light that joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the smart thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it literally fell apart the minute
I touched my mouth to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just from falling in the ocean earlier
when I jumped into the lake, to the ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: with it in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did have an ocean cure,
didn't we?
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of an ocean cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pin and out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not pinning out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chilling, chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chilling out.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washing the planes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Departures and arrivals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, these two characters.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sun on the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful people everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is falling apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like my bush living in the north.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ash joints at the end of the line here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disintegrating and falling apart.
All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to have this aquarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess this is another puff
Wednesday here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll be back when we're back,
and who's with us will remain to be seen.
See you next time.
