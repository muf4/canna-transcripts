ride here.

behind the Albert Heim and all in all it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a beautiful evening.

it's not raining is a beautiful evening.

[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about glass blowers in this
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the piece that you see right over
there in the back with the cutter sticking
[SPEAKER_01]: out is one of the entries that we're
sponsoring this year for the Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a collaboration between the glass and
the salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's totally adaptable for
concentrate, flowers, or half.

[SPEAKER_01]: Marcel can take you through this piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the masterpiece that these guys
brought along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me about this thing, Marcel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's all about the new paradigm
culture of the marijuana movement and the
[SPEAKER_03]: glass pipe movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working together in the genetics,
building up the structure and carrying
[SPEAKER_03]: this energy beam.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're creating the product that we're all
so fond of and the Sherlock on top to
[SPEAKER_03]: represent the pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're taking high technology,
all these machine parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically from the technological war
machine repurposing the core and the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: technology of manufacturing with that type
of product and bringing it out to carry
[SPEAKER_03]: our payload and our culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys have done it.

[SPEAKER_01]: It feels so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to see that tonight with the
lights turned off and see what it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes it like shoot out?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's argon in there and you ground it out
to the electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's running through the gas and making
the plasma that you can see and it grounds
[SPEAKER_03]: to your body and goes to the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an electrician.
