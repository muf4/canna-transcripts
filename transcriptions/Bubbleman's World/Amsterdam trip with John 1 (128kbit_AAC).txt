[SPEAKER_01]: Alright guys, Bubble Man and John B.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just cleared customs, or not customs,
security.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's customs, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about to catch the 420 flight to
Amsterdam, cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll probably see you guys on the
plane, but we will definitely see you in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we're waiting for John's cart
right now, so maybe we'll give a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of footage from the cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming to give us a ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently they're bringing us bongs and
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna take us all the way to the
end because we're in like gate 53,
[SPEAKER_00]: we gotta go to gate 78.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, we'll catch you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, Bubble Man and John B.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now on our flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flight 682 to Amsterdam, departing at 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best time of day?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but, you know, this time at 420 I
can't pop, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but we're all medied out and we've
had many, many trippy sticks outside at
[SPEAKER_01]: the airport, so we'll be landing in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be going right to the hotel and
setting up the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we'll show you a little bit of
the flight, try to show you a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's going on outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, when we land at Shiphole
International, we'll show you a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, have a good flight,
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have a good flight too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, see you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all prophecy, everything that's
happening now, it's all prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthquakes, acid clouds, it's all
prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: New world honors in town, it's all
prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon Bob will not be going down,
it's all prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel time speeding up, it's all prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warfare bleeding up, it's all prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weapons of mass destruction, it's all
prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back on where we come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taxi's over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the queue's up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, we'll go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be putting on the jacket real soon,
I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I have officially landed in
Amsterdam, and we're gonna jump in a cab,
[SPEAKER_01]: head to our hotel, and see if we can't set
up a little session here ASAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Bubble Man here, John and I
have finally arrived in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've bumped into Karma Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we're gonna pull up the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the D-nail here, we got the
mothership in the house, put that right
[SPEAKER_01]: next to the shell in black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that, very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see what else we have in the
house here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up with a little bit of bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna set the D-nail up,
and we're gonna do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we had to split Karmas,
we got to do one quick dab, and we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: split Karmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: John got some birthday weed, I think he
gave him some Karma OG, some, what else we
[SPEAKER_01]: got?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got headband, Karma OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one he said is a new one he's
trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're gonna go get our phones
taken care of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just walking up by Central Station,
and yeah, just walking by Kiwi Gifts,
[SPEAKER_01]: Central Station over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good old Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicely baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a session soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey little man here, we're just getting to
our apartment, and we're about to walk
[SPEAKER_01]: right in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey John, how's it going?
Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we set up that D-nail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the mothership in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the electric nail in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the tie nail for now, because my
quartz is on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give a little view of our canal,
right out, backing out into the red light
[SPEAKER_01]: district.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the bulldog right there,
and down this way we have the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we got the D-nail set up,
but it's important when you're puffing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam to not set off any fire alarms,
especially in some pretty fancy hotels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna go
over to the bathroom here, and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: look through, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one we want, and what do we
want it for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to get a major fine,
but we're gonna put this up right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need no trouble, and look,
you can still see the plastic from the
[SPEAKER_01]: last guy that covered it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, alright, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna open this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shower cap, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna ensure that we don't get any
fines while we're puffing tough here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a great room right on the canal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bulldog right outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got beautiful swans sitting right out
in front of the canal, and the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: just across the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get that D-nail going,
shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so the D-nail's climbing,
420, and going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the mothership here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of some OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we got John B.
[SPEAKER_01]: here, Mr. 42 years old right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a 42 year old dad for ya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're just starting with the mini
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, we're not, you know,
we're not trying to prove anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to hit the D-nail there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: My turn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I'll do one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best thing about the D-nail is
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting right back in there.
And if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're done, I'll hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, one more rip for the road here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna go out, and I don't know if
we're gonna go bump into D-nail or Enrico
[SPEAKER_01]: or who, but here I am hitting the
mothership with Noble.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's this for bubble man styles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned for more Cannabis Cup.
Thanks for watching.
