[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowman here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still in the city of Barcelona or
Barthelona as many of these citizens
[SPEAKER_05]: pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hanging out with Ripper Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are really cool guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They absolutely slayed the spandibus
competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they took home two first places
and a second place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to reiterate we'll get pictures of
the trophies later on and we're actually
[SPEAKER_05]: just here today to make some bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to be making some
bubble with Jibs today for the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: David from Ripper Seeds is going to be
joining us and we'll probably have John B
[SPEAKER_05]: throw in a few things as well while we're
making the bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't we check out Tony and the
rest of the crew setting up the shots
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're filming this for the documentary so
this is sort of a behind the the stage
[SPEAKER_05]: scene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just sit there for a second?
[SPEAKER_05]: An outside shot of their shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this?
[SPEAKER_07]: White and purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, purple is better.
[SPEAKER_07]: White is the oldest white.
[SPEAKER_05]: In French it's blanc.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a few things.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is very rude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Zombie Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what places did they get yesterday?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was all too fast for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two firsts, two firsts, two firsts,
and one second.
[SPEAKER_08]: One second in hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Second place in hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which hash did you get?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yours was like right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The zipper bag?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the...
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no shortage of cameras.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nor did we view hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many microns is that screen?
[SPEAKER_05]: This one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this 200?
[SPEAKER_05]: Silks and nylons are measured differently,
if you can translate Luis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Silks and nylons are measured differently,
if you can translate Luis.
[SPEAKER_08]: 17 microns?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little further back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull your mic back four more inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, jibs is up.
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 micron.
Mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we charge?
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we take a break?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's getting the sound, so... Yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The third one will do the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like the idea of, you know,
the three different... Could even get John
[SPEAKER_06]: putting a bag or two in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: White and purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just pull those three bags out and
replace the other one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_08]: one second.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before you do that, put it back in the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean take it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean take it out of the bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not listening, jibs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it back in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: No trim, just straight nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go from your face down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do my three things?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just pull a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This should be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did like that bright light.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just have to almost move right out
of the way for me to get this shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe over here, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They pop a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good gland right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come target.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, was that hard to get.
Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever do that with like a Scott and
Marsta thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they look like their follets?
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at these ones, Tony.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just waiting for things to settle
in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a bit dry, so it's actually nice
and absorbed the water quite nice now.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the way through, in fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So soon we'll be opening up the bag allies
and getting to our mixing part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they didn't get perfect every
time, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to give them some time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long are we waiting before we shoot
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be about like two,
not even two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give that girl, you give that girl a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were filming a documentary and then
Soma gave everyone his insane hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that, almond roca?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this called?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is organic pistachio peanut brittle,
but no peanuts, only pistachios.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my own recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got only full melt water hash in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like full melt water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really works good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about an hour to feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got another hour to film our
documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it to so many sick people who have
fibromyalgia and cancer and heart
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're breaking up some of that
22-week bloom?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-week flower sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-week flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash that Matt had, that's the hash he
won with, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt Barron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, he won with Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best fucking thing I smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Matt does it up, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gives love to his plants.
I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spent time with him in his garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's gone already too, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he had to leave today.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some of his watermelons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some what?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I guess we're going to get back
to making hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so this is a preferred method
because it works throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you can use it most of the year
without really having to change it very
[SPEAKER_08]: much unless the humidity levels are way
too low and the stock will get too dry too
[SPEAKER_08]: quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first times you chop it with a
card, it seems to be a little hard,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it passes.
[SPEAKER_08]: As it goes breaking down, it dries up a
little bit and it becomes easier.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he prefers this method rather than the
sieving because he gets the impression he
[SPEAKER_08]: has to preserve more heads if he is gentle
enough.
With the card.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for storage purposes, it's always
storage.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you store yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're storing it out on a cubby sheet,
on parchment, maybe with a layer of paper
[SPEAKER_02]: towels underneath that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, with the drying of our
climate in Colorado, you can keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: jarred up the vast majority of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally use to store my hash in a
dark closet or drawer or store it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, in Colorado, you can keep
most of the time in a glass jar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's possible because of the climate,
which I know is very fast, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, both to do it and to try it the
way I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he prefers that he relates making hash
to taking care of trichomes in a plant so
[SPEAKER_08]: when he would smoke it, then he would make
extractions, so not before or after
[SPEAKER_08]: anything?
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess when it's possible to,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Super greasy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason that he gives three weeks
of it to dry is because he does it as he
[SPEAKER_08]: would with the weed anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can see that with this humidity in
this geographic region that two to three
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks of proper drying could be necessary.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your times like in the West Coast,
Mark?
[SPEAKER_08]: The whip?
[SPEAKER_08]: In Vancouver, how long do you finally dry
your hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in Vancouver, I'd say minimum
seven days, seven to ten even.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be done in a week in here,
but it's possible for it to get moldy.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was just going to stress the fact
that we have three different geographical
[SPEAKER_08]: areas and they all seem to work very
different with their weather.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I should probably mention that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's also interesting for them is that
they're traveling, seeing the differences
[SPEAKER_08]: that Rick Liman creates because in places
like Jamaica, he prefers different resins,
[SPEAKER_08]: different pulses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you've also seen it with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: With our Reaper Haze, the 90% variety,
for example, is half a sack.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the other varieties, the 90% of
the varieties, the highest quality is the
[SPEAKER_08]: 73% He has one of the, he's noticed among
his own varieties also difference on what
[SPEAKER_08]: bag gels better.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even within their own line of strains,
there's one that would be better 90 than
[SPEAKER_08]: the rest, or the rest of them present a
pretty good 73%.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like his gentle style.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wendy's straight grease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Straight grease and he's still managing to
get it powdered up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell the powder that he's got
now, if he spread it thinner on a bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: screen, I think that it would,
yeah, like if that powder that for 120 he
[SPEAKER_05]: just did, he needs a screen twice to three
times to four times the size of that
[SPEAKER_05]: pressing screen, more like the screen
that's underneath the cardboard there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that spread out on that screen with
the proper air surface and stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe even some of these chamois pushed up
against the screen on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_05]: it would dry this hash much faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's going to transfer the
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: He told me that this one, if it were one
of these,
[SPEAKER_08]: it would dry much faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: The air flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's still, he's still making,
he's going to chop it even finer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured this was a first level and chop
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He thinks that it's how resin,
the fact that yeah, I think so too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We left not enough moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wicked too fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We needed to pull the patties and within
pretty much about four or five minutes we
[SPEAKER_05]: should have seeped them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If more moisture is there, it's fluffier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's marching out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's marching out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's official.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here at Rip Receipts and we're
munching out, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys grow dank resin, dank bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got a beautiful grow shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nice to be here in Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soma's in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Buddha's in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all around great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little import.
[SPEAKER_05]: That smells more like cream from India.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's it from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't smell like Morocco at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So doing a little dry sift carding with
jibs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just put a tiny little bit of this
sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also Zombie Kush sitting here
with Big Buddha as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to have you here, Big Buddha.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so yeah, we're just kind of playing
around with the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buddha's been a fan of the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, I guess from right after his first
Legends dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seemed like he would really stepped it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right at that point, I remember seeing you
be like, no, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the screams.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're showing right now,
I'm showing the guys, is that it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: patient work.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no rush.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just patient, consistent work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So jibs is gently bringing the resin back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a warmer environment so we have
to be careful not to create too much
[SPEAKER_05]: friction, but what he's doing here and
getting it as thin as he possibly can and
[SPEAKER_05]: spreading it out over as much of the
screen as he can is going to ensure more
[SPEAKER_05]: surface area for more contaminant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you work on a small little section of
the screen, you're just cutting your own
[SPEAKER_05]: surface area down, in which case you're
making this patient work even slower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I carded for, what would you say,
maybe 10 minutes or 7 minutes?
[SPEAKER_05]: At least 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 10 minutes I carded for and I got
about 50% of the content.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of contaminant out of this
particular hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jibs just started a couple of minutes ago
and I suspect he's going to go for a good
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe we'll get Milo on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get Big Buddha doing a little bit of
carding.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be a collaboration between
Ripper Seeds, Big Buddha, Bubble Man,
[SPEAKER_05]: and Jibs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you've known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to collect it up too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what another good thing is,
Jibs, is working on small sections at a
[SPEAKER_05]: time, like breaking them into lines the
way you're breaking them into and then
[SPEAKER_05]: literally working on just those little
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the smaller you work with,
the faster and more effective you'll be,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you end up working with more than you
can deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I first put it in, it was too
much when I first put it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I put it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why the beginning of the
carding for me sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's getting a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slowly, maturely being cleaned up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to card for a while and we'll
come back to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buddha just came back and grabbed us and
said they got some stuff they want to show
[SPEAKER_05]: us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some top secret stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're driving everybody out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you're nice and alone in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike's got to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's been born.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the proud father of some pure heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony is officially done with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need, I need real food.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, he was waiting for the magic
trick.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is the cleatest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was very dirty sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a lot of hair in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I've cleaned it, there's hair
in each pile, which could be removed with
[SPEAKER_05]: a simple trick using a balloon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rubbing a balloon on your head and
spreading this thin on the screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably lift those hairs out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have the time to like want to go
through it myself, but that's your first
[SPEAKER_05]: grade right there, which will be very,
very pure heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be your second grade,
which will still be very pure heads and
[SPEAKER_05]: about 10 times cleaner than most people's
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is talcum powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Powdery, powdery, powdery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fill this one with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also lower quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we use the high quality, it would be
incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I can do is purify it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pure, but the quality is the
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very bad, much better, very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are your three piles.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it was really good coming and
hanging out and making hash and cleaning
[SPEAKER_05]: up hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are great hosts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, puffing.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Mhm.
