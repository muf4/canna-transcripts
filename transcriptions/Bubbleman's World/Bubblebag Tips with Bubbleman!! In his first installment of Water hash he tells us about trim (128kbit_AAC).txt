[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to do a new little series of
clips called water hash tips with Bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first tip is going to be today in
regards to preparing the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start right at the beginning?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got nice trim, it's a good
idea to go through it and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no types of contaminant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want any fan leaves in there or
any types of stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate your fine trim and your popcorn
bud out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do this at the start while
you're trimming off the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're using fresh material,
freeze it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using fresh material,
no problem, but make sure you trim over a
[SPEAKER_00]: tight screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help save some of the dry sifted
resin that will fall off due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: brittleness of the dry nature of the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use cannabis buds, you can use
trim, you can use stock, you can use all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different things, but really make
sure your trim is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it separated out and you'll find that
the quality of your final product will
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes go up quite a few notches just
from doing this simple tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope it helps.
