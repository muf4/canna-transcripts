[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, how's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Driving up to Whistler with my good buddy
Dave, who's on the camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we're just heading up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It finally dumped.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got some traffic up ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: We better pay a little bit of attention.
Let's go.
All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Heading in to see the boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wrong door.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wake up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time to party.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wake up.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're at the party zone here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ryan's sleeping on the couch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we're going to get this fucking
party started.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can my buddy clear the wax off his board
on your deck?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can he, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_09]: Waxing that board.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably have a better way of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: We missed it, but here's the after
effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: Devin just took the biggest hit he ever
took.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday, NHD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puffing balls with Devin Begley.
[SPEAKER_07]: Devin Begley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, what are we doing today, birthday man?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go shred the gnar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shred the gnar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a name for birthday,
man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good day, gamey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my god, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pick one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: One's white.
[SPEAKER_09]: One's the color green or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one's like a funky, like insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just some trippy shit, huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some trippy trippy.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're 2.0s, too, which means they come
with two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it slide out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Comes with the original one that you have
to fill in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it comes with a 2.0.
[SPEAKER_09]: The crack's right in half.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can put the material right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Trippy Sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trippy Sticks for life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've got to film this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ours is a burrito.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: And no sausage?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Hey, we could be twins.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to the Whistler Gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the, I don't think it's actually
the original, original Creekside Gondola.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they replaced it once since the
70s or twice, maybe.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're in the Creekside Gondola.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the gondola, as some of us like to
call it locally here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to have a little puff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when puffing in the gondola,
I always implore you that it might look
[SPEAKER_09]: cool to blow your head out in your
friend's face.
[SPEAKER_09]: But just blow it out the window.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way, when kids or moms or whoever
wants to get on, they don't have to smell
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you still get to enjoy the goodness of
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one more reason not to smoke
joints.
[SPEAKER_09]: You smoke one joint in here and it just
reeks for the next hundred people,
[SPEAKER_09]: which it seems funny, but it might not be
to certain people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't see me hit every day with a lighter.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you do, I'm shredding Whistler
Mountain.
[SPEAKER_09]: See you at the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: Graham in the goddamn pipe was like a
bubble.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw a guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was his birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's celebrating a birthday just like mine
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I gave him some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, as a generous man he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, he puts the whole gram in
one hit, where the bubble literally was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a volcano.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just waiting to erupt with good aroma.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is where we're heading.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hitting up the Montaigne.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the Creekside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Down that way, where we just came from.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like we got some snow out there,
boys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, for one, am stoked to be here on
Whistler Mountain on my buddy's birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys always do it up good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure we'll be having a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
There we go.
Coming
[SPEAKER_08]: around your side, Dave.
Let's do a chemistry of the brain.
So this is really rather than what we
would have expected.
It is
stronger, which is boosted by being grown
under light.
How many of us would actually be in the
sky?
It's another matter.
It's just a scoop behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look out for just 15% of the UK market.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15% of the UK market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a chemistry of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
Let's do a chemistry of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
Get stumped and die trying.
Get stumped and die trying.
Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is stronger, which is boosted by being
grown under light.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of us would actually be in the
sky?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another matter.
It is stronger, which is boosted by being
grown under light.
Get stumped and die trying.
Get stumped and die trying.
Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get stumped and die trying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is he filming?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, BubbaLand here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just on the... Fuck, what chair are we on?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on Crystal Chair, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on the Crystal Chair!
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on the new Crystal Chair,
heading over what, Fraggle Rock right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, coming up on Fraggle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeesh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, we're gonna try to do a Trippy
Stick hit, but it's snowing and fuck up
[SPEAKER_09]: here right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We in a blizzard, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: We in a blizzard, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna test the Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see what we have here, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we've got a battery.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna pull out my Rastabattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rastamon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll pull out some new elements
that I just got.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trippy Stick elements.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gold or silver?
[SPEAKER_07]: Gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Top of the podium.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go gold, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking a hold of Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking a hold of government.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're patriotic in the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we got our Rasta Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're on.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are heating up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she giving us love?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if her battery's giving us the
love.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might not have charged this one enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, what we do is, we use the other
one that I charged.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I fuck up on my charging
ability.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is she giving us love?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get this going, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no doubt in my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the things you do when you're on
the mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clocking in on the clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely on the clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me that Trippy Stick love that I know
you have for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little Trippy Stick love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we want there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna put a little of this there
watermelon hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some watermelon.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I'm just gonna pour a whack
load in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Filling that shit everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gonna pass it over to the birthday boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Parker's in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna hit this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, birthday boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I can see the vapor hitting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is working well.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is working.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is working very, very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trippy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting trippy, boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let me see.
[SPEAKER_09]: The button flipped on you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's down here now.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so nice to see it coming out of
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little birthday puffin on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just in the burn trees here as you
can possibly see.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you get lifted on the
chairlift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taste the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wanna hit that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whistler riding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we're on Blackcomb, but kinda
everything's Whistler up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fresh turns.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is what we call Fraggle Rock back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing on that thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not getting a hit?
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get you one.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a hit, Dave?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just pre-pack it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-packing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll wait for the Vien up here anyways,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might as well keep this thing fresh and
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wanna hold it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give it to him and have a hit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll catch you guys in a little bit
when we're shredding more pow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.
This
[SPEAKER_06]: is a Light and Bright Beach Production.
This is
a Light and Bright Beach Production.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Light and Bright Beach.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Light and Bright.
This is a Light and Bright.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Light and Bright.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Light and Bright.
This is a Light and Bright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're up.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the knoll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that shot on this with the rest
of the mask, for sure.
We'll just...
[SPEAKER_08]: Last call.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright there, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always boys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're ready there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_09]: Little bit of fog on the lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this tree will block you,
but I'll get a little bit of your jump.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's the sliding water to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice crown.
[SPEAKER_03]: That a boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hopped in good, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got like... You know what's nice?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a nice sequence of shots.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are both of us in it at the same time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Ethan crouched out at the tree,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, you guys are in it for the
start.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good sequence of shots.
[SPEAKER_09]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: You got some good bro shots, like right
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Laying out a turn.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is nice, right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I zoom in on you there, you're going
to be like... That's the shot for your
[SPEAKER_09]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the white room?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That a boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: We set off that nice fracture.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just felt it behind me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like all the snow comes down and
clips me again off the fucking... With my
[SPEAKER_09]: camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I literally was just talking
about an old fracture.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that time when Mark almost died?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a little idea of the depth here.
[SPEAKER_09]: How deep is it, Ethan?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, fucking deep enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, not deep enough, but it's
fucking steep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get a camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: Noel party.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the crew that made it here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Devin's birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Devin's up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, bitch?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm operating video cameras, cameras.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a mountain puffin right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a chop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puffin at 5,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't go that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't go that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I got a boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dusty's bound, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dusty's bound.
[SPEAKER_09]: Birthday boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about this table?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Zach for today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Zach's a stoner.
[SPEAKER_07]: He always gets my gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?
Come on, come on, let's get out of here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Come on, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Dusty's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, where'd you get the fancy pants,
Mr. Fancy Pants?
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to do a disco jig?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, man, if you're going to sing that
song, you better sing it like with a high
[SPEAKER_07]: voice.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's my snowboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll fucking dig, dig, dig, dig,
dig.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can do all the snow skating,
because I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you kill yourself, I'll be
happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds legit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Staring at life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Staring at life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, the Ville.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you feeling, Ethan?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fan-fucking-tastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fan-fucking-tastic over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fan-fucking-tastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck yeah, bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I drive a Mini Cooper, but I think
we'll all fit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a smart car, but I think we'll all
make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I am a clown.
[SPEAKER_09]: The clown shoes are on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually roll with like 18 of my friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: In my Mini Austin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mini Coop.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'll admit, 12 of them are
anorexic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about some heated fucking bridges,
huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a heated bridge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very purdy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smells awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smells like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smells beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smells like Margie Juana.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think more people should smoke
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's good for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It stops cancer and shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes doing absolutely nothing amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll turn your boredom upside down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you say you had a mat up there?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I'm heading up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You dropped it in place, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sense?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something Ryan pulled out of the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_06]: He pulled tons of shit out of the
dumpster.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a backpack.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, stop, stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is he doing in the dumpster?
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is he doing in the dumpster?
[SPEAKER_09]: Margie, dumpster.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, what in the fuck?
[SPEAKER_09]: I tore them right off, sent them back to
Burt, and they sent me fucking roller
[SPEAKER_09]: boots for free.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was sweaty.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was doing this on my sled.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to smoke some hash-hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys want to smoke some hash-hash?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have another bong wrap.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got some watermelon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit smaller, but darn it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready for a bong wrap,
E?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got the bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff the bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: We usually have beeline.
[SPEAKER_09]: We usually have a D-nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I forgot everything today.
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you've got to be in Rome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we're in Rome, when we've got
nothing else, we suck on the lighter.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about a bong wrap with your mask on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it, E.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for now.
[SPEAKER_10]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.
Bye.
