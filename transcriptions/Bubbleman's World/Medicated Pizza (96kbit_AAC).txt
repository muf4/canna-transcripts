[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in my kitchen and it is the same day
I showed you the dry sift repressing and
[SPEAKER_00]: reheating up to avoid that whiting out on
your wet wash or your dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dry sift, it's a guarantee that
it's moisture pulled out of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's wet wash, it's a little trickier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be moisture that you left trapped
in there or it could also be properly
[SPEAKER_00]: dried bubble that sucked moisture out of
the air through the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing now is I was going to
make myself a pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got myself the pita pizza crust and I
put a little tomato sauce on there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I realized, well this is an excellent
opportunity to medicate my pizza and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: an excellent opportunity to share with my
audience because personally I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make the best medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know if I make a medicated pizza,
you guys are going to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think of other things that
could be a better way of doing it and we
[SPEAKER_00]: could start a dialogue and see who could
come up with the most awesome medicated
[SPEAKER_00]: pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing the old standby that John and
I have done in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my dry sift right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple grams of it actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be putting that much on,
but I'm going to sprinkle it quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my crushed garlic and a little
bit of pineapple and then the key is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mozzarella cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than put this thing in the
fridge, I'm going to put it in the oven
[SPEAKER_00]: for 8 minutes or 5 minutes, which I could
easily cook at 400, 420 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know John's favorite temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I haven't decarboxylated the dry
sift, I'm going to put it in for a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time on a lower heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably take about 12 to 15
minutes to cook this pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed from the few times that
I've done it that the dry sift becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more active and for whatever reason
the cheese is an incredible carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real good fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really gets it into your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel it almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what we're going to do is we're
going to take a little bit of this dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift and we are going to gently drop it
down onto our pizza crust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've probably put so far maybe a
quarter of a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking to get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably just put about a half
gram on this pizza and it's still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be quite active, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of this, a little bit of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also take a little bit of the crushed
garlic and do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop it down on that pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pizza is going to be pretty simple
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I make them fancy, sometimes I
make them simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's going to be pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapple and cheese and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dry sift was, oh jeez I think it
was barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get this all on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mozzarella cheese which is going to
activate that sift for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting in that sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get this into the oven for a nice
slow cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show it to you guys when it comes
out of the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so our pizza is cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about 15 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deliicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's take that outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicated pizza with a little bit of pink
lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I think that was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already consumed some infused coconut
oil today about three or four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to give me full effects as I'm
inhaling through my vaporizer for those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never a bad idea to medicated pizza in
the middle of the day if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surrounded by my strains in beautiful
British Columbia and I'm ready to try out
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry sift medicated pizza.
Thanks for watching and I hope to hear
about your medicated pizza recipes on
Bubble Man's World.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
you you
