[SPEAKER_12]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're going to go live.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do a quick little go live.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to see you, by the way, Mr. Joshua.
[SPEAKER_12]: You too, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just preparing the live stream and then
I'll do a little introduction.
[SPEAKER_12]: This will go up on the podcast as well on
Pandora and Spotify and Google,
[SPEAKER_12]: Android and Apple.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I really appreciate this, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's super kind of you to host and give
this give your space, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm a little bit freaked out all
day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been freaked out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like even now, I click Zoom to YouTube and
it's preparing the live stream,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's not moving.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's done this before and freaked me
out.
[SPEAKER_12]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll just.
[SPEAKER_12]: You do it through Zoom.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you send me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Zoom I do through.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it looks like I'm going to have to try
this again because it's not working.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_12]: It says in the top left that YouTube is
live now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So welcome, everybody, to a new.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to say season because I kept
the same HashChurch 1.0 for like three
[SPEAKER_12]: years, I think, before I went to
HashChurch 2.0.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_12]: Show us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Show us the love.
[SPEAKER_12]: View stream on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we are going.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome, everyone, to HashChurch 4.0,
episode two, the second episode of the 4.0
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of season dash, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Joshua Rutherford and we're
going to be talking today about his new
[SPEAKER_12]: regenerative conference that he's doing in
let's see, Maine, Michigan, Oklahoma and
[SPEAKER_12]: California.
[SPEAKER_12]: California.
[SPEAKER_12]: California.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I got them right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got it, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, give us a little update here and
then I'll let the rest of the crew in.
[SPEAKER_13]: My Instagram posts are annoying just
enough that everyone, even the Canadians
[SPEAKER_13]: can focus on locations.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always feel bad doing the posting and
posting some of the same stuff,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's amazing how much I learned that I
have to repost to for everyone to see it
[SPEAKER_13]: because I'll still get people that,
oh, is that happening?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, man, I've been posting it on
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Marcus, and welcome
everybody to HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always a pleasure for me to be on
here because I was a big fan in spitting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I've watched every episode of 1.0
and many of them multiple times.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, this is the, it's HashChurch 4.0
and this is the fourth time we will be in
[SPEAKER_13]: Humboldt doing the Science of Regenerative
Cannabis Cultivation Conference.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm quite honored to be honest and I'm
very excited.
[SPEAKER_13]: The time spent not seeing people during
this pandemic has been hard for everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so for me, this is kind of my first
time getting out and I think it will be
[SPEAKER_13]: for a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's just going to come with a lot
of excitement, a lot of good feelings.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, pretty cool deal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, yeah, we're going to invite some
of the other speakers on and we're just
[SPEAKER_13]: going to kind of wrap it up, you know,
about what we do, what the show is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Marcus said, I put it on.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of an intense show, but also low
key in the same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't hype it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not any sponsorships or tables or
boothing or things being sold,
[SPEAKER_13]: albeit what we, you know, some people
might sell some seeds here and there,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a show.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a profit driven thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the speakers do have products or
brands that they are associated with,
[SPEAKER_13]: but we ask them not to pump them up and to
really be about education.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it kind of the tickets are 450
bucks and I always feel really bad because
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a chunk of money.
[SPEAKER_13]: But in reality, it is such a value and
that you are paying for the speakers to be
[SPEAKER_13]: there and to interact with these speakers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so today you'll get a little taste of
some of the questions and the quality of
[SPEAKER_13]: folks we have.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like I said, it's quite humbling for
me to get to spend time with each and
[SPEAKER_13]: every one of these folks.
[SPEAKER_13]: I learned so much from them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kevin Jodry, Chris Trump, Suzanne
Wainwright, Dr. Elaine Ingham,
[SPEAKER_13]: Steve Potent Ponick, Steve Rasner,
Eric Branstad from Life Depth Solutions is
[SPEAKER_13]: the Greenhouse Guru, Dragonfly Earth
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Although they won't be able to join us in
this season's tour, they've been,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, a vital part of the deal for the
years that we've been doing it and their
[SPEAKER_13]: huge support.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so it's, you know, it's a real heady
crew and, you know, I asked them to spend
[SPEAKER_13]: time there.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't just come up and do their
lecture and bounce out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I get them two to two hotel nights and so
two or three hotel nights, sometimes the
[SPEAKER_13]: whole thing if they want to stay.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you'll be able to smoke it up with
Eric and with Kevin for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll be around and you can chop it
up with these guys and get real
[SPEAKER_13]: connection.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it ends up going beyond that for most
folks.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's a lot of folks in our
community that I'm in contact with at
[SPEAKER_13]: least that have come to these conferences
and made some good connections and started
[SPEAKER_13]: businesses and seed companies.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, so I'm just kind of going on,
but it's just kind of try to set the tone
[SPEAKER_13]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when you hear these guys speak,
a lot of us, there's season coming on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Season is like the, you know, ground level
helper with me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have to say that she doesn't have
a title.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, she helps me put it on and
humbled.
[SPEAKER_13]: She does all the stuff on the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: She gets the thing organized, the location
and the food and in the past, she's done
[SPEAKER_13]: all the cooking for 200 people.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: My season.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I could get some video
going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see, I see Steve's in here and
Steensland's in here and Branstad.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so focused on, on Humboldt that I keep
forgetting that Josh was going to be with
[SPEAKER_13]: us for the rest of the tour.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're stoked to have you here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love, I love what you just said.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was very reminiscent of hash church
where you were kind of like, and I didn't
[SPEAKER_12]: know this about the conference to be,
to be honest about how it's not really
[SPEAKER_12]: like, don't come and promote yourself
overly come and just promote your
[SPEAKER_12]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I absolutely love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I get that, you know, the way the
world turns and the way we hustle and we
[SPEAKER_12]: make our money is by promoting ourselves,
selling our products and doing all of
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: There really is something to say about
maintaining the integrity of the
[SPEAKER_12]: information.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've always felt the same way about hash
church, you know, to not monetize it
[SPEAKER_12]: specifically because I felt like it would
affect the integrity of the information
[SPEAKER_12]: that we were sharing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the minute you put that filter of kind
of monetization, sometimes that people
[SPEAKER_12]: are, you know, I mean, we just did it with
hash church this last month in Los
[SPEAKER_12]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the first one we ever threw where
we allowed sponsorships and we kind of,
[SPEAKER_12]: we changed it up a little bit,
just trying to grow it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I got to say, man, I appreciate that
about your conference.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is, that's on point.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It, you know, it's not that I don't,
I'm not trying to make money, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I want to do that in other ways.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so like, I feel that the, I feel that,
you know, the speakers can speak for
[SPEAKER_13]: themselves, but I feel like folks have got
recognition in this that has kind of let
[SPEAKER_13]: them make money in their own sideways,
you know, and it's, it's, if anything,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's just been a validation of,
to the community, you know, so I'm really
[SPEAKER_13]: grateful that I can do it and be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, and actually people buy my
seeds because of the exposure.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, it's a blessing that went to,
you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm having minor technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_12]: I see on YouTube, the link is going,
it says it's recording.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 157 people watching, but it's
really just me, Joshua, and potent ponics
[SPEAKER_12]: on the screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't see any of the other people.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll just be in the background,
trying to make sure this all works and you
[SPEAKER_12]: guys do your thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: There she is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey season.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's, let's introduce who we got
here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Eric, are you with us?
[SPEAKER_13]: I see your, see your logo.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Eric Branson.
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of you guys know Eric.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been on hash church a jillion times
and travels the world speaking.
[SPEAKER_13]: And are you, you're doing so much stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't even connected for a while.
[SPEAKER_13]: So why don't you just tell us what you've
been up to last, like two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, I mean, I have, it's been a whirlwind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't caught up with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody, everybody's been pretty busy
one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last, you know, years too,
I guess with the way the world's been
[SPEAKER_06]: going, it's been harder to connect in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, after leaving the
greenhouse company three years ago,
[SPEAKER_06]: I started my own company called greenhouse
advisory group.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just been consulting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a little job with a distribution
company, the gate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing procurement just to try to kind
of keep some, keep some things going while
[SPEAKER_06]: I was starting my, my, you know,
my company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did that for like a year and a half
running around the hills of Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_06]: actually sleeping in tents and trying to
find trend and flower and stuff for the
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was actually super fun,
but it was pretty hardcore at the same
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then March of 2020, my consulting
company really took off and I've been busy
[SPEAKER_06]: ever since.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been cool, you know, I mean,
I don't work in California as much
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think because of the market tanking and
certain things that people are laying
[SPEAKER_06]: people off more than they're hiring
anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've kind of been fortunate to stay
busy in some other States and learning a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to say that, you know, as much as
I'm there to help, I feel like I'm,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting to learn so much at the same
time that it's pretty rewarding on that
[SPEAKER_06]: part.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you muted?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I was going to say what, maybe on that
note, what's maybe an interesting grow or
[SPEAKER_13]: technique that you've come across that you
weren't, you weren't, you weren't seeing,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, in Cali.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: The techniques are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: You kind of see that even in Cali.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's hard to go to one farm and
them doing exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, everybody does something a little
bit different, but what I would say that
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd see a difference in other States than
I see in Cali is the equipment,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the, the bells and whistles or the
fancy stuff that people throw at these
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in some cases it's because the
price of cannabis is worth more in other
[SPEAKER_06]: States.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the price, the cost of production,
I guess can be more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the, the willingness to throw more
equipment and stuff at these greenhouses
[SPEAKER_06]: has increased.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it doesn't necessarily,
in my opinion, make them run better or
[SPEAKER_06]: better greenhouses in a lot of ways,
they can kind of be a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_06]: headache, but man, I've seen more crazy,
fancy equipment and dehumidifiers and
[SPEAKER_06]: certain things that I haven't seen in
California before, because people decided
[SPEAKER_06]: to go, I guess, crazy in some of these
other States.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you enjoying that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because like, when I first kind of tuned
into you, you were the guy who was saying
[SPEAKER_13]: like, no, let's knock some of this
equipment out of here and try to use
[SPEAKER_13]: natural airflow and be wise about this,
you know, the environment we're in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, how do you feel about all
this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you welcoming the technology a little
bit, or are you still kind of cutting some
[SPEAKER_13]: of it out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's, it's, it's one of those things
where, you know, when I show up,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's either I try to bring, you know,
you know, earn the paycheck or bring the
[SPEAKER_06]: value that I can by trying to make things
work rather than, you know, saying none of
[SPEAKER_06]: this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the way I would do things or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to incorporate what I like and
understand and what I believe works best
[SPEAKER_06]: with whatever system there is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, at the end of the day,
sometimes trying to dial in these things
[SPEAKER_06]: and work with what they got has been the
challenge for me to kind of learn about
[SPEAKER_06]: all these things and then how to make it
work right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, I come from the idea of
supportive environments.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people have this controlled
environment that they still carry around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody wants a controlled environment,
a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still don't see greenhouses as being
as controlled of an environment as say an
[SPEAKER_06]: indoor, you know, an indoor is a little
bit more controllable, 365, 24 7.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it comes to greenhouses,
I mean, shoot in the middle of the summer,
[SPEAKER_06]: it gets really hot and not all of them
cool down like you want them to.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so greenhouses really are more of a
controlled environment, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the winter time and the summer comes
and yeah, you have all these pieces in the
[SPEAKER_06]: puzzle, but how do you create the best
support system?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in my mind, the control thing
really kind of goes out the window because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's really not any control.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like getting these systems to do the
best they can to reach the closest to the
[SPEAKER_06]: parameters that we want, which isn't
really control.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, if you don't have the
right support system in there,
[SPEAKER_06]: all that control stuff doesn't necessarily
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then dialing it all in to make it work
together is another difficult part.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like go, wow, what is this place going
to have here?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in the next greenhouse,
wow, what is this place going to have
[SPEAKER_06]: here?
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of times I wonder who signed off
on this shit and how is there no liability
[SPEAKER_06]: for some of these companies?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but it's definitely eye
opening.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all the different growth styles,
greenhouse, indoor, you know, growing
[SPEAKER_13]: controlled greenhouse in the winter.
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you setting up if you have an
unlimited budget for a personal grow?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, my personal grow,
I mean, I like beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, you know, organic living soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you were going into the
commercial space, what I've been learning
[SPEAKER_06]: and working with at scale is some more of
the growers that do an organic approach
[SPEAKER_06]: with Dosatrons and like three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, at scale, one of the
reasons that people kind of start to shy
[SPEAKER_06]: away from the organics is, yeah,
one, the cost, but two is the delivery
[SPEAKER_06]: system and the ability to not have clogged
emitters and,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, so it's been a real fine line to
find the right, you know, products and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff to work into these systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've seen a lot of good things with
a couple of special farmers with,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, three gallon pots on a really
good organic system that I don't see
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's starting to work and I'm starting
to notice it's scalability and things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with my travels and all these big
farms and all this other stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's surprising.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people strive or wish for
organics, but it really comes down to
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes A, the cost and B, the
deliverability of everything and to make
[SPEAKER_06]: it work right consistently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so some of the farmers that I've seen
being able to pull that off lately have
[SPEAKER_06]: been in the game for like 25 years and
they've done everything under the sun and
[SPEAKER_06]: they've kind of come to this place and I'm
like all over it going, whoa, what are we
[SPEAKER_06]: doing here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I want to, you know, I want to check
this out a little bit because it's really
[SPEAKER_06]: hard to take a salt farm and convert them
to beds, but it's easier to take their two
[SPEAKER_06]: or three gallon pots and start to trickle
in some type of an organic approach or
[SPEAKER_06]: even trial to have them do so that they
can sort it out and see if it's worth,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, going into.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Kev?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Steenzen, are you with us?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to kind of introduce
everybody and go, go through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I sure am.
[SPEAKER_13]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you in the grow room?
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you're back at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been back and forth the East coast,
West coast every month.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend about a week over on the East
coast with Ohio fire factory and I've got
[SPEAKER_03]: a new client over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've been on planes lots.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have a client and the Ohio factory?
[SPEAKER_13]: You got two things going.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to tell us about the Ohio fire
factory?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a year and a year and a half ago or so,
some of my, my old Marine brothers and I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Marine Corps veteran for those of
you that didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get together every year and have a
reunion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just kind of hang out and shoot the
shit and catch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple of my brothers had expressed
interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was right during the 2019 season when
I was doing the a hundred acre hemp,
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp grow, and was talking to them about
it and was very excited and also had the
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff going on in Suriname.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they had kind of expressed interest
in, you know, doing something together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I, I just kind of,
kind of laughed it off as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be really cool,
you know, but it'll never happen type of
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we kept talking, the idea
really started to consolidate and condense
[SPEAKER_03]: into reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before we know it, we were actually,
you know, putting plans together to do an
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor facility there in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my partners owns, owns the building
outright and had a whole half of the
[SPEAKER_03]: building that was kind of being leased to
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, I'll kick them out and
let's do this thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it, it slowly became a
reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're in the middle of our first cycle
of our first phase of a build out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's eventually going to be about a
hundred lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be all indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just cultivating the way
I've been cultivating over the years with
[SPEAKER_03]: just very minimal inputs, focusing on Dr.
Lane, meaning kind of a soil food web,
[SPEAKER_03]: biologically complete compost as being
the, the main vehicle that kind of drives
[SPEAKER_03]: our fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I want to be talking
about too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I really wish I could have
made it to the Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just a priorly committed that
weekend and it was, it was, there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: budge there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really bummed because I know a lot
of, a lot of my friends and colleagues are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be at the Humboldt get together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other three I'm open and available
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's really kind of one of
the things that I wanted to talk about was
[SPEAKER_03]: just to share my experience and what I've
learned from the last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't been very active on YouTube,
but pretty much just don't do anything on
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't been as, as much of an open
book as I have in the past with what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think this is a really good
opportunity to share what I've learned
[SPEAKER_03]: over the years, what I picked up from Dr.
Lane's foundation course material,
[SPEAKER_03]: how that changed my perspective in regards
to chemistry and fertility, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as related to, you know, and how much more
important biology is in that, in that
[SPEAKER_03]: scenario than chemistry necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and we, and there's some interesting
anecdotal evidence that we had found from
[SPEAKER_03]: our 2019 grow and we're going to be
pushing forward in this indoor living soil
[SPEAKER_03]: space with a, with a heavy focus on
biology being the main driving factor to
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant's fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to try to, we're going
to document that with a chemistry analysis
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and plant sap and tissue analysis,
as well as the biological monitoring and
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just hopefully in a few years we'll
have a lot of really good data to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to, to present and to, and to discuss,
you know, along the veins of doing in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, kind of what John Kemp is doing
in main ag and big ag, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've got some really interesting data
that's been, that's repeatable,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that points to say a soybean
field, they're, they're taking a chemistry
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis of the, of the soil before
planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say there's in this arbitrary
130 units or 120 units of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: They plant their soybeans or, or whatever
their crop is and the crop uses 130 units
[SPEAKER_03]: of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they retest at the end of the
year and the soil has the same 120 units
[SPEAKER_03]: of nitrogen that it had to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so if we think about biology and
our soil and our parent material as kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of an inexhaustible resource and a mine
for the NPK and trace that kind of any
[SPEAKER_03]: crop needs, then we can really start
having discussions about the importance of
[SPEAKER_03]: biology and that interaction with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's kind of what I'm hoping
to have a discussion with folks.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, every time I pop on your,
your lives on Instagram, you're doing some
[SPEAKER_13]: cool experiments.
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched compost through the spring and
summer last year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the Ohio fire factory, are you
taking the same approach as in like a
[SPEAKER_13]: water kind of only approach where your
compost base, no compost teas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, extracts, compost extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not going to, the only time we
would do that the actual brewed tea would
[SPEAKER_03]: be if we were doing a foliar application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now that's just kind of not in
our regimen, you know, like we're really
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping to that very simple, simplistic
approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a very simple kind of IPM
regimen, you know, that's a kelp and aloe
[SPEAKER_03]: foliar with, you know, enzymatics or
really kind of like in the mountain
[SPEAKER_03]: organic stuff, you know, it's a really
nice product that's kind of pre formulated
[SPEAKER_03]: and works, works for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, everything is going to be very
much the same kind of water only approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any kind of biology addition that's going
to happen will happen in between cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once cash crop is in nothing but water
is the ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in this first cycle,
first and second cycle, we are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing some compost extracts mid cycle,
just because it's the biology isn't at the
[SPEAKER_03]: levels that we would, we would necessarily
want right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're just trying to kickstart
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest problem is, is if you're not
making your own compost, you're pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much buying a reduced waste compost,
which is not going to have a lot of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the protozoa and the things that
you need to really kind of cycle nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: and mine those nutrients from your parent
material and your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're implementing our own composting
program at fire factory and anybody that I
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to or work with, I really kind of
encourage encouraging them to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, implement these kind of
composting programs in place that are
[SPEAKER_03]: really going to afford you the ability to,
you know, generate your own biology
[SPEAKER_03]: reserves that you can use on at your
facility or your homegrown.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you doing the composting indoors as
well?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what we're going to do at fire
factories, we're going to just build a
[SPEAKER_03]: little kind of a pole barn type open,
open sided pole barn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do the bulk of our
composting in the spring and summer and
[SPEAKER_03]: then store it through the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so we're just going to kind of do mad
dash when it's nice warm and not have to
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with the cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you, as you can imagine, Ohio is pretty
chilly and I'm, I'm not interested in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in composting indoors necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're, we're just going to,
we have plenty of space outside of the
[SPEAKER_03]: facility to, as even like a big concrete
slab that we're going to end up using
[SPEAKER_03]: because we're pretty close to a river.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that the EPA gets a little
funny when you start composting near water
[SPEAKER_03]: sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're fortunate we've got the slab to
work on and we're just going to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: leverage that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you said you're, you're going to build
up to a hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your first phase right now?
[SPEAKER_13]: What size is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now we're at 28 lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 20 at 28 lights, 14 beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the most recent pictures you've
seen, if you've seen on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my typical fashion, we kind of overgrew
it a little bit, but I I've only been able
[SPEAKER_03]: to be there one week out of the month and
my two partners have zero cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say zero, I mean fucking zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them's an electrician by trade owns
his own electric, you know, business
[SPEAKER_03]: contractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other guy is a runs a very,
very successful kind of finished carpentry
[SPEAKER_03]: business where he goes in and does the
finished carpentry for hospitals and BAs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, he's booked out till 2026.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy's a whiz and really a really great
micromanager.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've really found over the years to
find people in your, what the talents are
[SPEAKER_03]: in the, in your team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if they're kind of conflicting
with your personality, like I am not a
[SPEAKER_03]: micromanager.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm the furthest thing from a
micromanager, but you kind of need
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody on the team who has those skills,
who has that attention to detail to really
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of push the projects through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's been a huge benefit in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've really learned a lot from him in
the little bit of time that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: working together, you know, in this
capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've known each other for years,
but you really don't really know somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: until you move in together or started
start a business together, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's pretty much true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you guys served together.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you had, you know, that's maybe a
little bit more than you would have with a
[SPEAKER_13]: normal friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we can cut, we can cut through the
bullshit, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's always going to be times where
there's a, there's a potential headbutting
[SPEAKER_03]: situation, or you have kind of conflicting
ideologies on how to approach things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that we have this kind of
this history together where we can,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're really comfortable, like family
calling each other out or being like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that's stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't really let feelings get in
the way, which, which helps a lot at,
[SPEAKER_03]: at kind of keeping, keeping things moving
forward and not stagnating communication
[SPEAKER_03]: in the team or lack thereof is what can
make or break a business in, in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in most circumstances.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to cut you off there, Joshua.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are at our limit for Josh's.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't have any more in the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at three now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I also wanted to say that someone
in the chat while you were talking about
[SPEAKER_12]: micro managers said microbe managers
manager.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought that was funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I I'll try to figure out who it was and
give him his props.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to interrupt and welcome everyone
new to the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Introducing folks.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kevin, Kevin, Joe Dree.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Most folks know you, you've been on here
maybe once or twice before.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, I'm a virgin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, virgin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: First time on the show.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a, it's a cool show, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marcus has been doing this for,
I don't know how many years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first time on the, on the,
on the, on the platform.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure everyone's excited to see you.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you kind of don't need a lot of
introduction.
[SPEAKER_13]: Most folks know you and I'm appreciate,
I appreciate knowing you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I appreciate everything you've done to
promote and be a part of this conference
[SPEAKER_13]: and support it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and, you know, what have you been up
to the last couple of years?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to share with folks real
briefly what you're up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I've been doing a lot of
different work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The it's funny me like on the region
group, I'm the least qualified to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's, when it comes time to
hustle and move my feet, that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've been working on is really
global work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm in, I'm in, I think five
different countries right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have operations in five countries
that I'm an owner of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went global in cannabis because
California cannabis is such a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster that I didn't want to die in it
mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you, you can't struggle indefinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm someone who likes struggle,
but you can't struggle indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without diminishing your energy and you
end up getting bitter and burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did is I started just trying
to understand better, like how do I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: myself mentally fresh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's really allowing yourself to
go and work all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things that are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been, I've been hella excited
about that because it's awesome to work
[SPEAKER_00]: globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I worked on locally, you know,
like in Humboldt was we, we worked really
[SPEAKER_00]: on trying to drive attention to the
Appalachian program and regenerative type
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I came up with a concept that I was
able to work with cookies on where I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we should cover Humboldt
Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should bring in this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote the press, we laid out the piece
and we just broke, we'll break 5 million
[SPEAKER_00]: views this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 5 million views on a 30 minute video is
not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I know is my marketing is on
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's what I've been working on
is really trying to drive awareness and
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the people who do the work,
because that's not where they shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shine in what they do, which is
regenerative ag, which is really extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: time and labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't allow you the opportunity to
do all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked on the development of the
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ganja I came up with like eight
years ago, I sold at the green flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been an incredible program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how do you drive attention to craft
producers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not even just craft producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all producers because I don't have a
beef with big operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, if you don't like big operations,
tell me you walk to work every day and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll listen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you jump in a car, then I don't
want to hear your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really about trying to do the best
job you can and to bring attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and cultivation in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just for little, it's for
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what happens is when you start to
polarize the conversation, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States, anytime you point at
someone being not good or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: complaining, Americans look at it like
you're a loser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is, is it's the
opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you cry about getting the shit
kicked out of you, the more people believe
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the shit kicked out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I don't play that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never fucking see me cry a set of
goddamn tears since you've known me
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that no one gives a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have to do is, is highlight the
positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have to do is, is,
is get people enthused and caught up in
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do, which is really the beauty of
agricultural appreciation at any level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I've been really
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I work on business development
around the world, but in my area,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's strictly been to drive attention to
the craft situation by using Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought all the ganja into Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Humboldt is where all the education
happens, which is a fucking inconvenience
[SPEAKER_00]: for everyone, really, because it's,
you know, it's, it's up the hill,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what it does, it allows the students
to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me introduce them to craft
cultivators in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets them tour craft farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the impact is really been excellent on
a lot of these farmers because we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to highlight their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, when all your product
sells out, you're kind of enthused about
[SPEAKER_00]: the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you have is buy-in when
there's results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really all I care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, fuck, I'm 55 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, I've been, I've been in the
game my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to see is positive stuff come
forward, or otherwise what we end up
[SPEAKER_00]: having is just a decimation of
agricultural appreciation by virtue of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that you can't get any type of
traction in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it comes right down to it,
man, it's really, can you sell the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: you make and how do you get people to be
aware of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you drive that information?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get so much shit going on,
you know, me, I'm fucking never stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: moving, but that's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you explain the ganja program a little
bit more?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think it's, I didn't understand
it first, and you know, now what I now
[SPEAKER_13]: understand, I think it's really cool and
it has the potential to really help us all
[SPEAKER_13]: move our product, you know, and in the way
that you guys are developing the students
[SPEAKER_13]: to come out and do the grading system and
kind of create a scale.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you explain that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the basis of the ganja was really
common language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem is we all use different
terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the biblical babble where
everyone's talking a different language
[SPEAKER_00]: and no one has any ability to make any
type of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the ganja, it was really
trying to determine how does one teach
[SPEAKER_00]: people how to evaluate cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you give them some
historical background on cannabis so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can understand really where we came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really stealing everything we know
from the past, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you take some of that
information and bring it into the current?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you teach people how to
look at cannabis and give them an
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation process that is pretty fucking
thorough?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the beauty of the ganja was that it
wasn't one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was like 18 of us that got
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say we spent almost like
7,000 man hours combined over a two year
[SPEAKER_00]: period to create it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arguments, the wars over what we were
looking at and what's graded and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: noted and what's important and what's the
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hysterical because all of us were
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're blasting on each other constantly
to determine what's really something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can agree on that we believe is valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did is it gave us a really,
really thorough evaluation process,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows you to be able to compare
apples to apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal was to identify the best,
which I always know comes out of craft,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to identify the value which comes out
of commercial because the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: operation should be able to sell at a
cheaper price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two are the only two points I
really care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best quality flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the stuff that's affordable for
people who don't have the budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the masses need to know where the value
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those that want to experience really
premium cannabis need to know how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: come to that conclusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been a fantastic experience
because the industry is in such disarray,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the students have such hope for their
future that it's infectious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you get to be an instructor to
help people work on their goals of moving
[SPEAKER_00]: into this new industry, not so much from
the old industry, but the new industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're trying to bring such a
heartfelt drive, oh, fuck, it couldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: a better time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diversity of it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part that I'll be honest,
the part I like most is that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: probably right now with Gangea graduates,
I bet there's almost $2.8 billion in
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers sold under Gangea graduate lead
buyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the largest MSOs in the country
are graduates of the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that those people
who graduated that program and are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking aware of what good quality is,
and when you're controlling $2.8 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: in total sales in the United States,
because I added it all up myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you people are these heads of these
massive companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it allows them to be
able to start bringing forth smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, smaller producers,
and highlight them because they know that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the upper shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learned it at the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're able to do is we're able to
bring these people into the building,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're able to bring in, because it's
local, I can bring in local farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So season needs to get your ass over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get you in the room season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have you come by and meet the
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be awesome because that's what I do
is I just bring locals in that can speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we bring in all kinds of weird
herb that no one's ever consumed,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that's not on the market,
stuff that we like to fuck around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it lets people really get to
experience the fringes of cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way they normally don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows them to see the bigger
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also get to get the emotional
connection to the cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they get to meet them,
they get to travel to the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts to personalize that sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, the ganjie, it's about
cannabis evaluation and appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's always about move that
fucking weed, because if you're not moving
[SPEAKER_00]: it, we're all going broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to get, these people used to
bust my balls where they would talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the regen conference, but they
would say that I should be doing my own
[SPEAKER_00]: genitor of conference, because it's what I
focus on so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, listen, you want to work
doing what you do, you do what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis, we need to have
intelligent marketing, and we need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher level understanding of what makes
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to be able to be easily
explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And driven forward in a way that doesn't
go, they're bad, we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about you or I, it's about the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product has to stand on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that it can, it just needs to
be highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the ganjie is doing an
excellent job with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the quality of the
student that came through the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, you know how it is, you're going to
deal with a couple hundred people in your
[SPEAKER_00]: educational program, there's going to be a
couple of fucking wing nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were without question, some of the
nicest people I've met in fucking years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It couldn't have been nicer people who
were so about the new world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's the kind of stuff
that really just, it gets me moving
[SPEAKER_00]: because you need all the pieces together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have the development of the
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have the development of your
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have the development of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that has to be showcased and
marketed correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't have the ability to
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spending too much time doing your
craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, with the
ganjie, when we brought them all in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to see the diversity of who they
were, where it was people in every facet
[SPEAKER_00]: of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their desire was to build a new
industry that they could be part of,
[SPEAKER_00]: because most of them were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were definitely younger than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great program and the feedback's
been excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ramifications for cultivators that
got highlighted, it moved their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where you start to see the
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that they all fly into San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tell them where to go up and
down the state to buy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're coming up the hill,
I say, look, these are all the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries that sell craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some farms that have released
some really killer products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no money in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not like I'm trying to sell
my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pointing out people who have
really good product and where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did was it emptied out their
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, when all your gear is
being emptied out of the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have hundreds of people
highlighting your product and posting it
[SPEAKER_00]: and talking about it and consuming it,
it allows there to be that spotlight that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be the product that does the
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the product that people have the
relationship with ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people get to consume a
product from a regen farm, or I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: call it biologically driven, there's a
magic to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Gangea students allow that to be
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the students.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's similar to how I got to know you and
got to work with all these breeders that
[SPEAKER_10]: we were bringing
[SPEAKER_10]: in with Shango.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they put those videos up.
[SPEAKER_13]: All those guys went on and have sold tons
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure they were selling lots
before.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that really set a platform for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like you say, put a spotlight where I
could see that different people were doing
[SPEAKER_13]: different things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I could align with them for what my
needs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one thing that I see you bring
big time to the table in this conference
[SPEAKER_13]: is A, getting the genetics out there,
but B, bringing breeders that are getting
[SPEAKER_13]: their genetics out and making the
connection with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the breeders we dealt with,
I used them for years as partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would produce work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sift through the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find outliers and say,
hey, I want to push this into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would get full credit for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did is it allowed us to then
steer business back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the industry was changing,
I realized that maybe 2% of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to move forward because they didn't
have industrial assets, which is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have a license to do nursery work
to sell into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized that all these people
that I worked with were going to get nuke
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did is I publicity work for
the breeders because I wanted other people
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to see them on a platform and
hopefully be able to work with them in
[SPEAKER_00]: some combined projects where you could
bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to see them get knocked out
of existence because they didn't have what
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, which was infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I paid for all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those fucking things, all that stuff
was out of the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like I'm charging the breeder to
be on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid for all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a thank you for all the work we got to
do all the years together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I still do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're solid, I'll support you because
what I know is that all of us as a group
[SPEAKER_00]: make a healthy cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just grateful that I got to spend,
you know, shit since I was 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 43 years of my life I spent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could be positive in that,
then I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a full life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same with what we do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about, we used to be able to
just grow and move herb, but the game
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not really, really clear
about what you're doing, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm seeing is a decimation for
the small farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's shocking, especially in my area
where we have such a massive collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every single person I know is
basically on their hands and knees getting
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked in the fucking face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it doesn't have to continue like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, what we have to do is we have to
work in a way where we drive attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: the product, drive attention to the people
and create an attraction to the public
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes them want to play with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Tom Sawyer shit where I'm
painting fences and I'm getting people to
[SPEAKER_00]: paint the fucking things with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for me, but with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what gets people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to be part of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be involved in our lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of how do you expose
them to it and how do you frame it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just seem like I found out over
the years that I'm good at marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm trying to do is use the
skills that I have to drive attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got lucky that I was really
creative years ago and came up with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different things that we're able to use
today as those tools, those vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's an odd position
because it's not one that...
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to kind of introduce some of these
other guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Nicholas.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't expect, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a brief window and internet,
the wall open.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're on mute, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: But welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: He's still on mute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the window didn't work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I cursed the window.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but we'll see if you can come back
on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Chris, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you here with us?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, sir?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chris is the token natural farmer of the
group.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that weird dumb joke, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been with us pretty much every one
of these things, except for maybe the
[SPEAKER_13]: first one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Were you at the first one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I came into the second one.
[SPEAKER_13]: The second one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, out there in Redway.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's super, super exciting that you're
still back with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have been in a lot of transition in
the last couple years in your life and you
[SPEAKER_13]: want to just kind of share what you've
been up to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mainly been working with
farmers and food across a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different industries and some in
landscaping and golf turf management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big old farm in Iowa doing corn,
soy, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wine grapes in Napa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really for me, what I feel like is a
service, I think, to kind of the mission
[SPEAKER_01]: is just finding the parameters of what
makes financial sense for farmers in
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the tech works, but where are
those edges and those places where farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: making a living because this is
streamlined in their operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so farming that, finding that in,
you know, a thousand acres of corn and soy
[SPEAKER_01]: and alfalfa has been a interesting journey
and 700 acres of wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not just because natural
farming super cool doesn't mean that those
[SPEAKER_01]: industries already know how to plug it
into a massive operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so kind of with my background,
I've felt like that's been kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best use of moving this ball forward,
use of my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been a lot of fun and a lot of
challenges, but some really cool success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to interview some of those farmers
in the next several months and get that
[SPEAKER_01]: online so we can talk about a lot of those
things and just continue to get better at
[SPEAKER_01]: basically returning to tech we used to use
a few generations ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I was just, I was curious.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen a lot of Instagram photos of big
IMO piles and I was curious if you have a
[SPEAKER_13]: tally, maybe how many pounds you've done
in a year or, you know, like some sort of,
[SPEAKER_13]: cause they're pretty, pretty big ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truthfully, like before anybody was
hashtagging KNF is when I was probably
[SPEAKER_01]: making the most IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out in Hawaii making it for our
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were making 90,000 pound piles with
the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, it's been, I think last year
I made three,
[SPEAKER_01]: I made, yeah, four big old piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was 40,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was 20,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one ended up at 80,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever that adds up to 1500 pounds or
15, 150,000 pounds IMO by skid steer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was good fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worked really well for the
farmers has been the kind of the main
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to kind of put my head
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, we played with that project with
the, with the brinker hops out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like what's needed is a little
bit of finding those parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: What works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what didn't work, you know,
and here's, here's what's been played with
[SPEAKER_01]: and here's what's working well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just really talking about that super
publicly and, and letting, letting it be,
[SPEAKER_01]: that group discussion is I think maybe the
better, the best service for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Kevin said, you know,
what is, what is it that puts the
[SPEAKER_01]: spotlight to the product to move,
move the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something I'm looking
forward to learning about this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kevin appreciate the candid way in
which you talk about all things cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and wondering what kind of
Ganges we have out here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's, he's looking for the craft
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I've it was, it was a lot of,
a lot of moving parts last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as working with a bunch of
different industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a lot of work, a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year I'm hoping not to run around
quite as much, but yeah, still want to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of move the ball forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned a ton more than I knew a
year ago in natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's kind of the point
is that as a international community,
[SPEAKER_01]: we grow and being able to apply,
you know, this really basic technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people get into natural farming
and they want to get their microscope and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's super cool and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I applaud it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, like this technology
is about using like the, the really
[SPEAKER_01]: inexpensive and simple things to make the
food world and medicine world go round.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of just honing that in
personally, and hopefully for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to ask about liquid IMO.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of the focus of what you're
going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to drop any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Steve and I have been playing
with some of the parameters of producing
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of indigenous fungal predators for,
for carapace insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about how versatile that is anywhere
you are in the world is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: something we'll do this year, getting into
how do you cultivate fungi that will chew
[SPEAKER_01]: on all the your beetle pests and your,
your, you know, various bugs with
[SPEAKER_01]: carapaces and that's, that's fun because,
you know, whether you're in the US with a
[SPEAKER_01]: high value crop like cannabis or
struggling with, you know, different,
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, caterpillars in
Zimbabwe, like Steve was messing with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're able to use this technology
without a purchase, you know, really just
[SPEAKER_01]: by cultivating nature's tech, which has
been, that's been a blast because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that with that, with kind of an SOP with
that for the world, I think we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a pretty effective pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it IPMO, integrated pest
management organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're, you know, I think that's
something that could be further developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also I think is really ready for any,
you know, hobby farmer to apply a great
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's fun to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also just using the technology and
resources available to feed plants based
[SPEAKER_01]: on your growing style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's producing really amazing
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people that's a struggle,
you know, they, they, it's winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got no time to cultivate their soil
and they're just trying to go in with
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever raw materials they can bring
together and they need to feed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to feed their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so natural farming has tools for that,
but it's not all kind of laid out in some
[SPEAKER_01]: ready, you know, SOP for any different
scenario, especially in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the need to properly feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think talking about how, what ways
you can add to the, which is Bruce,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, to, to make it more ready for
your, your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is something we'll get into kind
of the versatility or the adaptability of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the base model and what do you need
for your farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'd be fun to get into and just,
you know, generally the technology isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: about chasing NPK, but at the same time,
some people want to use it to just push
[SPEAKER_01]: their, their needs through the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's not, that's not what this is
all about, but it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a right way and the wrong way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a way that can create some more
pest problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get an imbalance, then there's ways
that you can keep a balanced system.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're doing like, you know,
tissue sap, tissue sap, again,
[SPEAKER_13]: you're doing SAP analysis, you know,
then you can make a correction,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, really quickly with a foliar
feed or even a micro soil feed,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, type thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_13]: So super cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think we might want to keep going
down and get everyone in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have you, Nicholas?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm terrible at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down at the, our original farm turned
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was down here today, so I wanted to
chime in, but, but yeah, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, I'm excited for the conference and,
and I'm looking forward to sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_13]: What have you been up to the last two
years?
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I know you've been putting some
seeds out in the market.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen, I'm sure you're putting
cannabis still into the Oregon market and
[SPEAKER_13]: what's going on with you guys had a baby.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's been a huge transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's been, it's been, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, it's definitely a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and there's all this balance between
like passion and then feeling like it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're starting to get robbed of your
passion by just grinding away to try and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, try and stay in it for whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, the truth is, is,
is having the license and having the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to be in a public view has,
has given me a lot of opportunity and that
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to explore genetics through
the license is really, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really given me the office that I
needed in order to understand that process
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my background really like,
you know, when I, when I stop and reflect
[SPEAKER_02]: on everything right now, cause it's such a
crazy time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a, my background
has really been about being in the
[SPEAKER_02]: wilderness and, and exploring wild places
and understanding the earth and it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and, and that's really the,
the grounding component that connected me
[SPEAKER_02]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was, I was high as you could be in
all those places when I wasn't with
[SPEAKER_02]: students.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, having that ability to then
explore cannabis and all that it's given
[SPEAKER_02]: to me and all of my connections to those
places, like has just driven me further
[SPEAKER_02]: down the path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exploring the commercial side has been a
little bit like, it's been a kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: bummer to be realistic, you know,
it makes me wonder sometimes if I was
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe, you know, just got into something
that is just like, I'm not commercially
[SPEAKER_02]: driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my passion isn't about production
and, and per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what I really want to share
is, is passion for the earth and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and changing systems and not trying
to figure out how to squeeze some process
[SPEAKER_02]: into a commercial thing, but rather
changing systems, you know, from the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and understanding where true health
lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the last couple of years has been
quite a, an exploration into health and a
[SPEAKER_02]: reevaluation of what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and thank God for the genetic
explorations and, and the time devoted to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, observing how things respond to
environments and then asking ourselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do we want to relate to the
environment and in going forward in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in something such as a commercial
business?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I think kind of, you know,
has it's more downsides and upsides,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you're coming from a simple
existence is, is, you know, exploring that
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship and then, and then really,
you know, remembering the important things
[SPEAKER_02]: that got us to the places that we are,
at least for myself, which is nature and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and the way the cosmic, cosmic forces
display themselves on earth and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we receive that energy and,
and how to work with those energies and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and exploring the idea that energy is
actually a free resource that we have to,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to be able to interpret it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we think we got to take it,
transform it into something stored in a
[SPEAKER_02]: box and put it into a bunch of metal,
and then shoot it back out into the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: to me just seems a little bit like,
you know, at this point, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the right choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we need to keep scaling
our efforts up in in production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if we need to try and fit
into a commercial industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost think it's the commercialization
and the industry that has gotten us to
[SPEAKER_02]: these places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then you tack on all the kind of
bullshit stuff going on and in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in the government and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, it's just, it's, you know,
I'm not, I don't, I'm not sitting on any
[SPEAKER_02]: real clear direction except for
reconnecting to the natural processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: To better understand how we can create
something with less energy, at least
[SPEAKER_02]: through the perverted system of,
of industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I'm always like, you know,
the more things I package and sell to the
[SPEAKER_02]: market, the more dependent I am on a
manufacturing plant to make bags and
[SPEAKER_02]: stickers and, and, you know, and it's hard
to, it's hard to see myself wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep doing more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't know really what it
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to share perspective and,
and, and try to try to get to the heart
[SPEAKER_02]: and soul of what it means to be working in
relationship in a healthy way with our
[SPEAKER_02]: planet and our cosmos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to understand that the sun is
here to take care of us and that the water
[SPEAKER_02]: is the most important and complete essence
of life that we have to, we have to honor
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not control it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't want to play God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play participant in a much
bigger thing than I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to pretend I'm a creator of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to understand that we are just
shepherds of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and we, none of us created any
of these genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these genetics are just us
working with nature in a way that helps
[SPEAKER_02]: change things in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so yeah, you know, I'm, I'm kind of at
loss for words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a journey.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we both have that back,
that our bound background.
[SPEAKER_13]: We both worked for our bound and kind of
shared the similar experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and it was the, the, the,
my experience in nature that really
[SPEAKER_13]: changed me and, and enlightened me that I
wanted to farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I, you know, when I actually got
injured, that was like, all right,
[SPEAKER_13]: this is where I'm moving into.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just reflecting back on that,
that time, you know, the, the,
[SPEAKER_13]: the, we would always, we meet these stupid
crackers called Bickeys.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure you guys had them down in the
South and there were these highly caloric
[SPEAKER_13]: crackers that we'd eat with every meal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause you know, we could just pack them
in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we tell the story to the,
to the students, like on the first day and
[SPEAKER_13]: it was about the concept of leave no
trace.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you, you know, did you guys do the
same thing when the cookie crumbs or the
[SPEAKER_13]: cracker comes would come down,
you talk about the impacts and the
[SPEAKER_13]: environment of, you know, dropping micro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about micro trash and we talked
about leave no trace stuff, but I don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall the same crackers and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: We would use the story of the,
when the kids would eat the crackers and
[SPEAKER_13]: the crumbs would fall to the ground and
the kid would just dust off, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: these, you know, cracker crumbs all over.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're like, Hey, like, think about
this, what's going to happen to the,
[SPEAKER_13]: it was just like a teaching moment.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think happens to those cracker
crumbs?
[SPEAKER_13]: The mouse will probably eat it,
you know, and they're like, all right,
[SPEAKER_13]: cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what, what happens when mice have
more energy, you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: And like someone, well, they probably fuck
and they probably have some more mice
[SPEAKER_13]: like, cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just kind of follow that out until
we get to this like thing, like,
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa, my little micro litter here.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really does cause an impact.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it really just kind of sets the tone
for would set the tone for how we were to
[SPEAKER_13]: be respectfully moving through this,
to the wilderness, you know, and anyway,
[SPEAKER_13]: that kind of has really impacted the way I
view gardening too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the way I just view my impact on the
whole situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think that, you know,
a lot of the reasons I kind of left that
[SPEAKER_02]: space was I felt like there was a big
disconnection between food and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I thought it was always really weird
to be traveling around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you talk about that,
I think about like, Oh, the, the mouse
[SPEAKER_02]: probably is going to get cancer now
because of the glyphosate, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, well, it's probably not going
to do a whole lot more reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might actually render itself infertile.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I saw there, there was a big,
there was a big disconnect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my work has everything to do
with integration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to get back out into the
wilderness, but I don't want to carry bags
[SPEAKER_02]: of crap, you know, I don't want to carry
glyphosate drenched cookies and biscuit
[SPEAKER_02]: mix and junk, you know, I want to
understand, you know, the environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to, I want to go to these
places I want to integrate, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: camping or gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I guess it would be more of like,
you know, I'm not, I'm not a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: percent set that we need to be farmers and
production oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as an integration piece,
we all need to understand that in life,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get stuck doing one thing for too
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I always think it's important
that everybody knows how to grow food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean everybody has to farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means maybe for 10 years in your
life, you dedicate yourself to taking care
[SPEAKER_02]: of the community by growing food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that service pays you back later
because now your kids are doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get to eat that food from the
people who are farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, I don't wish upon anybody a
lifetime full of farming in this modern
[SPEAKER_02]: day, because you see it, especially from a
commercial perspective is that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: end up down a rabbit hole or, you know,
like what we got going on in Oregon is you
[SPEAKER_02]: got a bunch of hidden, you got companies
that are buying licenses and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not letting you know who's all
who, but they're all connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're creating really easy for the
dispensary one-stop shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they pull up, they, they've changed
some of the laws around manifests and
[SPEAKER_02]: making it easier for the big guy to come
in with everything that one dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: could need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The intake manager then buys everything
they need in that one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they no longer have a budget for
anybody else, but it was so much easier
[SPEAKER_02]: with this guy that showed up and he would
take all the product back that didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would, you know, provide you new
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so it's like competing with that
and being involved in the market helps you
[SPEAKER_02]: realize, wow, from a passionate,
without something like what Kevin was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about with is like somebody
spearheading an ability to kind of corral
[SPEAKER_02]: some really quality farmers in to a space
that just is like, Hey man, just do what
[SPEAKER_02]: you do and create what you create.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got a place for you, you know,
to play every component, to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketer, to be the, you know,
all this stuff that goes on in the chain
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it to the end point, even though we
have some advantages here in Oregon to
[SPEAKER_02]: being eaten up because we got other people
who are so competitive from a capitalist
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint that they're just making it
easier and easier and easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got the little people who are
like, well, I actually need to make more
[SPEAKER_02]: than, you know, $400 on a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how's this going to function when
they're offering $200 pounds at endless
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts at any testing result that you
could imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm not here to speak about
how great the market is and none of us
[SPEAKER_02]: really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all here to talk about our passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, the only reason
that our farm still exists has everything
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with our ability to produce without
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, you can measure
how regenerative you are by how many
[SPEAKER_02]: products you buy and the least amount that
you buy as a product from a store to make
[SPEAKER_10]: your operation exist
[SPEAKER_02]: out some indigenous microorganisms,
whatever you're doing, if you can do it
[SPEAKER_02]: with the resources from your space in
whatever ways, I think, wow, you're able
[SPEAKER_02]: to at least exist in that place if you
really want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we can drop our prices
to these places that even the corporate
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't really like, but it doesn't
serve us and it doesn't, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: get us where we want to get to,
which is essentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to, I'm not trying to like
get crazy rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to own land one day, you know,
I'm the owner of our farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's not like that doesn't come
with a whole slew of debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm thankful I have access
to land.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thankful and grateful for having the
experience of holding a license of working
[SPEAKER_02]: with genetics and being able to do the
things that I need to do in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, I don't know if any
farming pursuit is the one, if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: already own land, I don't know if you're
going to buy your land off of your
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because one, that to scale up the
infrastructure costs so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've thought about vertical
integration and taking on another half a
[SPEAKER_02]: million in debt and had opportunities and,
but, you know, it's like, I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: myself as I go further down this route,
ending up in Las Vegas and rubbing elbows
[SPEAKER_02]: with a bunch of people in hot tubs to hug
and sell some wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, it's not my,
it's not my gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I use this time as a way to bank a
whole lot of value in seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I'm just banking value
of what I believe has value, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that feeds the future,
which is seeds beyond anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that holds the most value is,
is our seed banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always has been and always will be at
least to anybody who cultivates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's a lot of hunter gatherers
that do an amazing job, hardly with having
[SPEAKER_10]: to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's the thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're working with the powers and the
forces that are way stronger than we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, again, the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we are holding some kind of
orbit around a sun is certainly what keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: us capable of breathing and living.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I want to connect with those strong
forces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we can stay alive through all the
craziness of this perverted reality that
[SPEAKER_02]: humans have created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it has to do with patriarchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it has to do with industrialism.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it has to do with capitalism and
economy and colonialism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, these are all the things that have
brought us to this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, we really got to look
at it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really have to change the systems
from the bottom up and change our
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation so we can not continue to feed
the system we don't believe in,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what I believe we do the further
into business we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know what the answers are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it feels good to watch a
sunset still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to always honor that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to go outside and watch
the birds with a little boy who's blown
[SPEAKER_02]: away by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I can remember the awe of the cosmos
and how it is incredible that we are here
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing and living.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to live in fear of the
natural world like it's coming out to kill
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe a lot of the common things
that are going around right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to represent the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: I share a lot of your sentiments,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're powerful in the way you share
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I appreciate you, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad you're coming down to
Humboldt's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to seeing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the Emerald Cup, and what a
blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was just not necessarily like a
blast of pure joy and fun, but like a
[SPEAKER_02]: blast of reality now post when I was doing
it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just like hanging out with people
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all the time, but I do enjoy
getting together with people and sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks for popping on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to introduce Season, the woman
behind the Humboldt Conference.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said earlier, she used to do all
the cooking for like two meals a day for
[SPEAKER_13]: three days for 200 people.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're an amazing season.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you also run a farm, and you have a
cooperative that you're working on,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you do a bunch of community work in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really impressed with all that you
do and the service that you do to your
[SPEAKER_13]: local and broader community.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it's been pretty cool to have a
front seat to watch all this develop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hearing Kevin speak about the Ganjier
program, I've been able to host a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: those students here on the farm through my
camping and hip camp.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hearing Nick say like having the
integration, I really feel lucky to just
[SPEAKER_08]: be able to serve this community with a
really tiny, tiny farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: I scaled down when all this happened,
and I got way, way, way, way smaller sold
[SPEAKER_08]: off a farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like, you know, I'm just really
lucky to be able to participate in this
[SPEAKER_08]: level and be on Aschurch with you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it is a great, great,
great experience and a great honor to be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to share my garden with so many
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this right now, I'm just going
through building a bathroom, the trellis
[SPEAKER_08]: program funds, and I've gotten equity
grants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, you know, for me, I feel really
supported by the planning department.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel supported by the county,
and it's like, that's way different than
[SPEAKER_08]: what most people are thinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just have to be really, really
grateful to be able to, as myself,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, just one person on the farm,
I have 3000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, Nick was saying,
you can measure your regenerative by the
[SPEAKER_08]: products you buy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, I really buy anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel pretty good about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, 100%.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a beautiful, beautiful garden.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and it's cool that the way you work
through and turn your shop into like,
[SPEAKER_13]: you're turning it into a community space.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she's right across the, you know,
two minute drive from the Richardson Grove
[SPEAKER_13]: RV park, where we have the conference
right by one log and, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: really close to Benbow and, and,
you know, kind of where like, like Kevin
[SPEAKER_13]: was saying, where he does the Gange,
but you're going to be able to do the,
[SPEAKER_13]: the goal is to do courses, like little
classes, mini classes and education.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you can also use that facility
for what else?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think farmers to do processing a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's, it's a model that's not really
accessible right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Steps, you know, for me to build this
bathroom, I have to get my old septic
[SPEAKER_08]: permit signed off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, yesterday I was digging
holes for five feet deep, just working on
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just a ton of tiny,
tiny steps.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do feel supported and it does give
me inspiration to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, how much more can I take on?
[SPEAKER_08]: It does take community support.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do feel like I'm in a really great
position, you know, and a great place and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm involved in the right thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just have to keep, you know,
taking the baby steps and not expecting
[SPEAKER_08]: too much to happen at once and just be
grateful for the opportunity and the space
[SPEAKER_08]: that I've created and the interest that
there is, you know, I wish more farmers
[SPEAKER_08]: had the community or the consumer outreach
that I have, because for me, I see that
[SPEAKER_08]: there are people valuing craft and they
don't know how to identify it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just having a place where they feel
comfortable with the vernacular and the
[SPEAKER_08]: language and, you know, other brands,
you know, there's not very many farms that
[SPEAKER_08]: are out there promoting multiple other
brands, you know, on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I feel really lucky to just have,
you know, that personal interaction and a
[SPEAKER_08]: place where people can have access to the
plant and it's such a natural way.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is more of a garden and less of a
production zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's really different on
what they see when they go on a cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: tour.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just feel lucky to be able to
offer something different and so sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people often tell me like,
you're the last person still having fun
[SPEAKER_08]: growing weed and it's because it is just
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a huge staff and it was like,
you know, the pressure that I had before
[SPEAKER_08]: that wasn't as fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was organic and it was in native soil,
but it was, it was high production and a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just feel really lucky.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I get to walk out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin was saying, if you have to drive to
work, I'm thinking, man, just walk out my
[SPEAKER_08]: door.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't even have to walk very
far.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you know, just a few hundred
feet away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, when I hear people speak about
it, I feel like, wow, I get to live that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just feel really lucky.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Feeling super good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge respect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone, everyone knows you guys,
you guys are hash church regulars and
[SPEAKER_13]: you've been on the tour with the regen
tour.
[SPEAKER_13]: And unfortunately that doesn't,
maybe if things change, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_13]: miss you guys this year, just the way the
laws are laying down and the government
[SPEAKER_13]: shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really sad about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you guys have been up to a lot of cool
stuff on your farm during this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been watching your Instagram and,
and I actually am so in awe of your guys's
[SPEAKER_13]: building.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know who's the main builder or if
it's all you guys that built together,
[SPEAKER_13]: but yeah, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your guys's buildings are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said to a couple of people,
I'm like, I got to get Josh to come do a
[SPEAKER_13]: building course, you know, and I would
just love to learn how to do that,
[SPEAKER_13]: man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, and you've been building a lot too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what I wanted to lead into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one of the things that we've been
able to do in our life is continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: follow our dreams and passions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by giving each other enough space,
you know, I've been able to, to really
[SPEAKER_04]: dive into what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kelly also has been able to dive into
what, you know, she does and supporting
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the human microbiome and the soil
microbiome and the connection of the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, but you know, the building is
part of what's really amazing on our farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, you know, natural building and
building from local materials and not even
[SPEAKER_04]: got going out to get commercial style
wood, you know, and figuring out how to
[SPEAKER_04]: gather it out of the lake or after a big
storm or instead of clearing codes,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Hey, there's a nice building.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're building log and keeping
it on the side or you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Branch is figuring out how to incorporate
them in the soil or make, or divert the
[SPEAKER_04]: groundwater in the winter during a big
rainstorm or how to use that material as
[SPEAKER_04]: fungal filters to filter the earth so that
our pot, our farm is a positive impact on
[SPEAKER_04]: the farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think some of the most powerful work
that we've been doing in the last two
[SPEAKER_04]: years is a lot of the work that Kelly's
been doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that a lot of the work that's been
going on has been what Josh has been
[SPEAKER_09]: doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, first of all, I just wanted to say
that we're really stoked about the
[SPEAKER_09]: regenerative conference because what we do
is we support regenerative lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_09]: We support regenerative small farmers,
the whole idea of them purely
[SPEAKER_09]: regenerative lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't just put out this idea that,
Oh, let's have them be called a small
[SPEAKER_09]: farmer, but let's them have access to all
of the licensing that all of the big
[SPEAKER_09]: corporate entities, all of the same fees,
all of the same fines.
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't make any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we've been working on is
sovereignty for small farmers,
[SPEAKER_09]: sovereignty for small farmers.
[SPEAKER_09]: sovereignty for our own human microbiome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the reason why we're not coming down
for the, for the regenerative conference
[SPEAKER_09]: is we've never aligned with any federal
government and we're not going to start
[SPEAKER_09]: now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just laying that out, like everything
that's going on, it's just not where we
[SPEAKER_09]: want to be aligned at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the ability to come down,
but we just don't want to partake in that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is also representative of our
life and where we're going, not just
[SPEAKER_09]: representative of this pandemic and
whatever bullshit is happening there,
[SPEAKER_09]: but representative of us becoming more and
more sovereign and, and really educating
[SPEAKER_09]: that out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how is it that we can truly change the
laws?
[SPEAKER_09]: So these big corporate entities in these
big political structures, basically lay
[SPEAKER_09]: the fuck off of the small farmer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is it that we can't grow many multiple
crops?
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why is because we have to spend
all of our money and all of our financing
[SPEAKER_09]: and all of our land and all of everything
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all of us in the regenerative
farming module and everybody in Dempure
[SPEAKER_09]: grows a tremendous amount of food and
flowers and they use their land for all
[SPEAKER_09]: different types of education components,
tourism.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we really need to be talking about what
is the next level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis has got us to this point,
but cannabis has always opened up doors
[SPEAKER_09]: and right now cannabis is opening up a
door of a myriad of plant medicine,
[SPEAKER_09]: a myriad of vegetable growing,
everything that Nick was saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nick, by the way, love you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You, I mean, everything about you and Liz
and who you are as family, as friends,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the support we love and cherish
Daniel, everything that you all have been
[SPEAKER_09]: going through.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just, just seeing here and
listening to you talk makes my heart
[SPEAKER_09]: expand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of you all seeing all of you all
after all of this time, we take a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: you realize what it is that we're doing
and, and, and why it is that we're so
[SPEAKER_09]: passionate about the work that we're doing
every single day.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wake up every single day and we're
thinking about the small farmer and the
[SPEAKER_09]: sovereignty of the small farmer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to be really blessed this
summer to have, even though we don't align
[SPEAKER_09]: with the federal government, the federal
department of agriculture is going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: coming to our farm with the premier again,
because they want to start talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: what it is that we're doing, because what
it is that we're doing represents every
[SPEAKER_09]: single one of you on this camera and so
many of you all who are listening.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is the next step in cannabis
cultivation is the sovereignty of the
[SPEAKER_09]: small farmers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have the ability to grow a myriad of
all of those plant medicines, because
[SPEAKER_09]: plant medicine is the next step to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Being able to be sovereign for us to be
able to have an independence and cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: came from a place of herbalism and a place
of the medicine man or the wise woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to keep cannabis sacred and
keep regenerative lifestyles alive,
[SPEAKER_04]: which the teachings are in the wilderness.
[SPEAKER_04]: The teachings are in nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: The teachings are within regenerative
family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like the plants that we ingest,
we want to become adaptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this time, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've laid out some of the things that are
hard, but like the microbiome eats
[SPEAKER_04]: pathogens, we need to eat oppression and
turn it into opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So through our adaptogenic ability and our
ability to connect like mycelium
[SPEAKER_04]: underground with these intelligent beings,
we're going to, we'll always be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to always be here because
we're strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have an alignment with nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're going to talk about water,
water pulses through our body at the
[SPEAKER_04]: highest percentage of anything in our
body.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water covers the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water surrounds the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may live in an amniotic fluid.
[SPEAKER_04]: The earth is probably covered in amniotic
fluid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what the Northern lights shine
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And glisten.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they show us the colors of the
infinite.
[SPEAKER_04]: They show us that we live in a
multi-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And water is the essence of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we ally with helping water
transform nutrients, we become smarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we drink water that's dumbed down
with toxicity, then it tells other water
[SPEAKER_04]: in our body to not be smart and not smart
enough to regenerate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want our water to regenerate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Masi Mota, the, you know, the,
the, the, the scientists, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: show us how water, you know, changes
through thoughts and through harmony and
[SPEAKER_04]: through wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're forming our land and texturing
our land to structure the water as it
[SPEAKER_04]: falls from the sky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And structure through some intricate
system to go into our body, to build our
[SPEAKER_04]: intelligence and to pulse the protoplasm
of every plant and every tree to create
[SPEAKER_04]: polypores and magical secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water is life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we choose to build our soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a sponge to grow fungi, waters are
our ultimate ally, our ultimate wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we eat it, we become more
intelligent.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it breathes with the plants,
we become more intelligent and water is
[SPEAKER_04]: something we all need to really look into
on how we can have a healthy source.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look for a piece of property,
try and find good water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, without good water,
it's hard to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So luckily our regenerative lifestyle,
we paid off our land.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the ability to, to, to ally with
nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the ability to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Live on the edge of wilderness and create
our own world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're going to create our own
world, it's going to be super magical.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also just speaking about secondary
metabolites, I just wanted to say that so
[SPEAKER_09]: much of us have been growing and this
regenerative conference is going to be the
[SPEAKER_09]: first time that a lot of people are coming
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the Emerald cup was as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, as we've been uptaking all
of this energy of what's been going on,
[SPEAKER_09]: in the last two years, it forms secondary
metabolites on how we integrate that
[SPEAKER_09]: knowledge and, and, and that nutrition or
that toxicity that we've been uptaking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, and I really want to encourage
people that, you know, that that uptake
[SPEAKER_09]: that we've all gotten that the secondary
metabolites that we're forming,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is going to be our communication and
coming together and communing is,
[SPEAKER_09]: is, is that of love is that of coming
together is that of, of, of us really
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding that we've all come from
incredible hardship at the last two years
[SPEAKER_09]: and that the secondary metabolites that
we're sharing with each other from our
[SPEAKER_09]: plants and also from our own internal
struggles and our own internal growth is
[SPEAKER_09]: that of love and connection and laying
down that ego and that dogma of what we
[SPEAKER_09]: might have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Picked up within the last two years so
that we can come together because the most
[SPEAKER_09]: important thing about all of this is that
small farmers and regenerative people and
[SPEAKER_09]: educators need to come together because
this is bigger than us.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is bigger than diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bigger than hip hop.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's way bigger than hip hop and hip hop
is big.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's even bigger than cannabis because
this is going to define small farmers into
[SPEAKER_09]: the next generation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to respect the poly culture,
you know, and the poly culture comes in
[SPEAKER_04]: the entourage effect of our, of our
medicine and the entourage effect of us
[SPEAKER_04]: coming together.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are the entourage and we didn't,
and we didn't pay off our land with just
[SPEAKER_09]: one single source of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have scrap.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have sold tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_09]: We hold strawberries.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done festivals.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've trimmed for other people for
seasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done everything that we possibly
could.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's part of the poly culture is what
Nick said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get caught up into believing that
you're just one thing because poly culture
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to give us a well rounded version
of our best selves.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, that stay on there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to ask you, I mean paying off
your farm, that has just, that that's my
[SPEAKER_13]: big dream is I just feel that's when my,
when my first step of real freedom is
[SPEAKER_13]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, getting, getting the property
and getting on and getting use of it and
[SPEAKER_13]: having the contract and the bank loan,
that was a big one.
[SPEAKER_13]: But as I started developing, it's been
like, this ain't my thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone can take it away from me really.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, especially now that I grow
cannabis, like they could literally take
[SPEAKER_13]: my, my loan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but I, I just, I just curious about
when that, not necessarily when,
[SPEAKER_13]: but when that happened, how that felt and
like how, you know, how that transformed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, originally we left, you know,
our area.
[SPEAKER_04]: As underground family, you know,
we were, uh, you know, refugees and it
[SPEAKER_04]: went for, so for years we were just,
you know, living at the herbalist,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the nature life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we figured out, Hey, we can,
we can transform this and, and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and bring this, you know,
and then get a piece of land.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just wanted to answer your
question is that we just paid it off last
[SPEAKER_09]: month.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the very last payment.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just made our last payment.
[SPEAKER_09]: January one, 2022.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how we came into this new year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're now in our fifties.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a, you know, a long journey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, and like Josh said,
we've been caretaking other land,
[SPEAKER_09]: renting places and all the while for 15
years now, and it's been a 15 years and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's been, you know, everything we do have
a feeling of freedom.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a feeling of, you know,
more than anything because we've always
[SPEAKER_09]: been outlaws and because the way that we
look at the world, I have this feeling of
[SPEAKER_09]: don't fuck with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that that sort of is silly,
but like given the world, it's just like,
[SPEAKER_09]: now I don't have to talk to anyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to, you know, it's just,
it's just now us and that feels really
[SPEAKER_09]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's empowering because,
you know, how we got, how we got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're here, you know, and we have
this land and we have all this
[SPEAKER_04]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the last two years, you know,
you say you've been on lockdown,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, uh, and there's so many places we
can't go, you know, like we're stuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're here making our land
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a perfect situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've made, we've turned this into a
spectacular opportunity to, for so many
[SPEAKER_04]: years, no one knew what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we came out and started teaching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're just back into our internal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do your craft.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what have you learned?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever anyone thinks about it,
do your craft.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the teaching.
[SPEAKER_09]: And did we celebrate?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we've been too busy working.
[SPEAKER_09]: So is the work done because we paid off
our land?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just totally begun because today is a
new day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the thing is in Canada,
you know, the family farm has never really
[SPEAKER_04]: been represented in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, it's been a very corporate
thing here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we, in this zone and other places
in Canada, we never really got to
[SPEAKER_04]: represent ourselves, you know,
in the way that people in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_04]: California, other places have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had to stick with that
compassionate medicine style, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that get, get the medicine to the
masses style.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, that's, that's timeless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and nature farming got us here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Nick says, it's, it's what you don't
spend that makes you money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and it's allying with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nature and nature farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that whole realization of,
wow, I don't need to spend thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars to farm every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just do it in the fall and let
nature take care of it over the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wow, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, it's, it's, uh,
we give thanks for every person here
[SPEAKER_04]: because they've all been part of our
journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eric greenhouse, amazing pro whole family,
incredible, you know, Kevin, Joe,
[SPEAKER_04]: Audrey, thank you for everything that
you've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're an inspiration to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like give thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin, Joe, Audrey, and season.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the work that you've done with
tourism is very inspirational to us here
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada, because we, and the Kootenays
would like to see a style like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you just as a bad-ass lady,
you know how I feel about you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you to the world and back because
of everything that you've been pushing
[SPEAKER_04]: forward for this plant and the community,
Steve with, you know, with aquaponics and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything beyond just incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got tricks up as Steve because he's
Steve tricks raisin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really appreciate his ability to,
you know, to think and everybody that
[SPEAKER_09]: Joshua you've chosen to come on and be a
part of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just really bringing it forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, and we really appreciate that
best friend farms out in Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already know how you feel about you,
Marcus most amazing person in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: holding space as always, and always
putting your best foot forward for
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative agriculture and natural
medicine, living soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, uh, we're doing a long intro,
but it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, so I want to, I want to move on
to Stevie tricks next, next potent ponics.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we talk actually often, so that's,
and this is a leading question,
[SPEAKER_13]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, what have you been up to for the last
two years?
[SPEAKER_07]: Been, uh, since I got back from Africa,
I caught one of the last planes out of
[SPEAKER_07]: Southern Africa in the middle of the
plague, which was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was mostly me and embassy workers,
uh, and then came back and I'm just
[SPEAKER_07]: working here in Oklahoma with a bunch of
different people on both living soil and
[SPEAKER_07]: aquaponics farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, for my talk, we're going to be talking
a lot about, uh, living aquatic soil and
[SPEAKER_07]: how it can compliment, um, your
terrestrial soils.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how to take, you know, different types
of aquatic inputs, aquatic IMO,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, kind of some different methodologies
and add it to your existing soil facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're doing regenerative soil and
you already got your stuff down,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, this is just going to help you
increase your biodiversity even more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also have some different
side-by-sides and some comparisons between
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes and some other things with one of
the groups I've been, uh, talking to and
[SPEAKER_07]: working with a little bit up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have some, some hard data on,
on those types of things with compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is compost with and without the
aquatic inputs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, very similar to what people
are doing to kind of give people more of
[SPEAKER_07]: an idea of, of a exact comparison to what
a lot of people are already doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're also going to be talking
about a new initiative that I've been
[SPEAKER_07]: helping try to put together called open
nutrient project, which is kind of a open
[SPEAKER_07]: source aggregated, um, uh, methodology
for, uh, having all of the information for
[SPEAKER_07]: different plant inputs in one place so
that people can know for organic inputs,
[SPEAKER_07]: what plants in their yard, they can
ferment or compost or make into teas or
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever their methodology that they
prefer is into one centralized open source
[SPEAKER_07]: database that anyone can get along with
all the different tests and whatever else
[SPEAKER_07]: they need to analyze that, uh,
and try to break it down to understand it
[SPEAKER_07]: in the same way that a lot of the salt
people do, but for specifically ferments
[SPEAKER_07]: and teas and organic inputs, the way that
all of us are so passionate about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, uh, some of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then talking about a little bit about
some of the more advanced K and F stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris was touching a little bit about the
IPMO, which is, um, utilizing some local
[SPEAKER_07]: pest control agents.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a lot of success with that and,
uh, in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, we're excited to talk about,
uh, that and share that methodology with
[SPEAKER_07]: people, um, as well as, um, just some of
the other different things I've been
[SPEAKER_07]: working on in terms of refinement,
um, on some of the other things we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to go over, um, the blue labs,
which is the phycocyanin isolates and some
[SPEAKER_07]: of the other really cool organic inputs
that we've been taking and anchoring with
[SPEAKER_07]: that are kind of building upon a lot of
the great work that, um, a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, the previous, uh, uh, people in the
organic space have helped us give us a
[SPEAKER_07]: wonderful foundation on kind of,
uh, and then iterating upon that and,
[SPEAKER_07]: and, uh, you know, adding a whole bunch of
new twists and turns to, uh, that
[SPEAKER_07]: methodology.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm super excited about that and super
excited to share a lot of this stuff for
[SPEAKER_07]: the first time with people.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just fucking like, boom, half of those
things I kind of understand.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, Steve goes deep.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's really deep into all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, uh, it's something that you're,
you're a very unique individual and how
[SPEAKER_13]: you deep dive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, he, he's, he's had a great talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: Steve has been at, uh, every one of these.
[SPEAKER_13]: What kind you missed?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um,
[SPEAKER_10]: the deep dive you take, like I said,
I'm just going to be myself, um,
[SPEAKER_13]: into all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm excited to hear your, your
iterations on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we've spent a lot of time talking
about terrestrial and aquatic microbes,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you've helped me figure out my system
and dial it in and, and kind of build,
[SPEAKER_13]: build upon it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's, it's been really,
really awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to introduce our best friend
Farms.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've, we've spoken, or at least
I've seen you on Ash Church before.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, maybe not officially we've met,
but what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to meet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I've seen you there a couple of
once or twice too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to just introduce yourself and
what you got going on?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in Maine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm up in Maine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cold here right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, got a, well, I have a larger acreage
farm, but I've got about 10 acres working.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a clear cut when we came in and
have actually the water conversation is
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause Maine has such good, such volume of
water and really good water.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's something that on this land was
like one of the key factors as Josh and
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelly were saying with, you know,
with, or as far as how important it is to
[SPEAKER_11]: the land and the whole conversation you
guys are having around water.
[SPEAKER_11]: So water was kind of a, a central focus
here where we have a good well and it goes
[SPEAKER_11]: deep.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've also dug a couple of ponds,
which, um, I don't know not to go on,
[SPEAKER_11]: but if it's on the water topic,
it's we've actually drawn some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: water away from the cannabis site where we
are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause Maine has so much ambient water.
[SPEAKER_11]: That I've drained off of the medical
cannabis portion, which is about a 10,000
[SPEAKER_11]: to 15,000 square foot portion.
[SPEAKER_11]: All in all, um, for the area and on each
North and South, I've pulled off the water
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of swaled in and drained off coming
into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, yeah, I've just wanted to let you
know, you know, we're, we're taking water
[SPEAKER_11]: importantly and trying to work with it
here where we actually have so much of it
[SPEAKER_11]: and are blessed by so much water.
[SPEAKER_11]: That I'm trying to kind of, you know,
collect it and drain off, but anyhow,
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that's the same thing I'm doing,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in a really wet space.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a, I have 10 acres and at least,
uh, two of those is, is wetlands,
[SPEAKER_13]: but where my cannabis facility is not,
but, um, it's still very wet and I've had
[SPEAKER_13]: to make, I've had to actually had to make
roads so that I can get through and with
[SPEAKER_13]: my tractor that I purchased and just
equipment so we can process.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it's like even the areas where I,
where I have to walk to my, towards my
[SPEAKER_13]: shipping container, it's all mud.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I can't wait to work, you know,
um, clogs or anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to, so it's, it's, I've really
learned about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've actually dug a couple of ponds and
I've built a filtration system where I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: filtering the water and collecting it off
all my greenhouse spaces in my house and
[SPEAKER_13]: every roof and everything drains all into
this pond system that I, that I'm now kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of my property is a hill and it's sloped.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to continue these ponds
uphill and I'll just kind of slowly
[SPEAKER_13]: trickle it through them all.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're all moving.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and I'm shooting for, um,
I think 500, some thousand gallons of
[SPEAKER_13]: water storage that I think it'll get me
through the four months of, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: it just kind of this big dream.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I maxed it all out and blew it all the
hell, wherever, you know, and I just kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of want to have this like super powerful,
uh, water system that I can rely on,
[SPEAKER_11]: but that's water.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got your dream for your water system.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was definitely, um, I was the last
five years before I moved back here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now for five, I was off the grid up in,
well, in Southern Humboldt and we were
[SPEAKER_11]: just, uh, pulling gravity fed water there
the whole time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So kind of got familiar with water from
the Hills without a system and then moved
[SPEAKER_11]: back to Maine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like this huge blessing besides the
peace and the freedom out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty isolated, but the water
blasting is just, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, water everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it became kind of one of those things
like move from back, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: back from west to east again, that we're
trying to, you know, work with the water
[SPEAKER_11]: and build the water dream here too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got this little, you know, kind of dream
going where I could actually pasture pump
[SPEAKER_11]: out with a solar, you know, uh,
inversion into even a little bank.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I've got enough drop of like 20
or 30 feet with this rock staircase
[SPEAKER_11]: waterfall already got that part in where
we're piped in and I'd like to feed
[SPEAKER_11]: turbine energy, even be able to kind of
get enough drop where maybe I could,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, run small turbines and talk to
someone who knows more, maybe yourself who
[SPEAKER_11]: knows if I could, you know, get some leads
on people that know what they're doing for
[SPEAKER_11]: more, you know, some of the off grid
stuff, even though we're on here and I'd
[SPEAKER_11]: like to aerate the pond, you know,
get some brook trout in there with some,
[SPEAKER_11]: we just put shiners in actually in the,
so trying to set the bait, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: to get the ecosystem in the pond too,
not just for use for agriculture,
[SPEAKER_11]: but where we have like a habitat and
ecosystem, even some food that could come
[SPEAKER_11]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was actually kind of wondering if
anyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to ask, I just heard that
you were recently Dempere certified.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was just going to ask about that
process and, uh, you know, who came out
[SPEAKER_10]: and yeah, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can the Josh and Kelly for, geez,
over a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this pandemic thing kind of
happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, I haven't got to show them the
land, which would be probably you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: what I would love to do the most is be
able to show those folks, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: what we got going here and get some
feedback and such.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, I've worked with ancient green
farm out here quite a bit and they've both
[SPEAKER_11]: been out here, Bobby, you know,
a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen him even in the last month or
so.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've been over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, he became pretty familiar with my
farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we talked about it there a lot
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, the last couple of years were
so fast that, uh, I just recently right
[SPEAKER_11]: into the winter, even as we came kind of
like shut down the outdoor portion,
[SPEAKER_11]: but, um, those friends blessed me with a
[SPEAKER_11]: hitting on and talking about is just like
how, how we're living.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, in Maine, um, definitely
trying to, trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: stick to that regenerative focus here too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And anyway, I could trail off,
but I remember now, uh, when you were on
[SPEAKER_13]: hash church at one point, you were showing
pictures of.
[SPEAKER_13]: Donuts, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that you that was making the hash
donuts?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I did some hash donuts, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just actually donated those for,
uh, for our veterans of VA is where the
[SPEAKER_11]: charity went to.
[SPEAKER_11]: We donated them for a raffle.
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are the originals are actually
sent out recently.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you, are you, are you pushing the hash
out in the, in the market there in Maine?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's kind of funny you say that man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, just today I came on a little late
because I'm meeting for the first time,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, the Helio friends here in the hidden
forest guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we were just kind of like doing a seed
meeting today anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, this brother's here right now,
you know, he's, we're talking the same
[SPEAKER_11]: type of shop that's going on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm, I'm doing some hash, but it's more
traditional.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know these guys are into the full
melt stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I have some raw.
[SPEAKER_10]: You look like you want to pop in.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, we can open it up to the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to introduce everybody and.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this, this kind of thing was,
was, is this somewhat intended to be a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit of a marketing for the
conference.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, I don't mind doing it because I
do feel that it is kind of a nonprofit
[SPEAKER_13]: thing that they were, the content is so
good.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'm not doing it to make a buck.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, so I kind of really just
appreciate, uh, you know, Marcus given the
[SPEAKER_13]: space and.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just, I will also kind of feel
guilty when I'm marketing, like I,
[SPEAKER_13]: I just so against it, but I, you know,
this I'm kind of justified anyways.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a bunch of people to go to these
conferences and, uh, these, these speakers
[SPEAKER_13]: are all fucking awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, I want to showcase that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because the thing really has been,
uh, you know, a powerful part of my life
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'm, I'm quite honored to,
to take part in the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad we're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really excited for this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I don't know, I just wanted to open it
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to say, you forgot the seed swap
on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone brings their seeds to share as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have not had the pleasure and
conference, um, you get, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone is sharing all kinds of amazing
genetics, um, not only cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: but vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there was a guy that gave me some
pre, um, civil war era, like okra seeds
[SPEAKER_07]: that are super amazing that I've been
keeping going and breeding out as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a whole bunch of other, just amazing
vegetable and herbal genetics that people
[SPEAKER_07]: are willing to share.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so it definitely brings seeds to share
if you are coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, and, you know, you'll get a whole
bunch of wonderful ones in return.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, just remember like a Ziplocs and
Sharpies, cause there never seems to be
[SPEAKER_07]: enough of those.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't write Sharpies on a Ziploc.
[SPEAKER_13]: You end up getting home and going,
what the fuck, hush.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'd like, I have boxes and boxes of
seeds that I don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_13]: I shit you not.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I've started my seed company off of
the gifts during these seed swaps.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got to look through a ton of stuff
and, um, but I do have a ton of stuff that
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, maybe someday I'll open it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if I don't know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just kind of one of those things so I
suggest writing on a card inside a Ziploc
[SPEAKER_13]: or, you know, just to kind of think
through how that works.
[SPEAKER_13]: But in that same, uh, notion, like I came
up with a concept talking with Kev one
[SPEAKER_13]: day, he had gifted me, um, some ChemDoc
special reserve root beer seeds or root
[SPEAKER_13]: beer ChemDoc special reserve seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, I opened them up and found a
couple killer females that were just,
[SPEAKER_13]: they, they held through the first or
second week in November here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had a gnarly wet year, a gnarly,
gnarly wet year, rain, all, all it was
[SPEAKER_13]: cold.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they, they hung through with,
with, you know, no mold issues.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they, they kind of represented the two
ends of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_13]: One, the ChemDoc, one, the root beer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I pulled a couple of males and I'm,
I'm open pollinating those right now in an
[SPEAKER_13]: indoor space.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, along with it, with the purchase
of the conference ticket, everyone's
[SPEAKER_13]: getting a pack of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and it's where the attempt is to do
kind of a regional group breeding project.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and so we, you know, we kind of have
the Humboldt California area.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got the Michigan, the Maine and the
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to, you know, I'm,
I'm working on organizing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, I've been very busy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I'd have it organized on by now,
but I want to get each of those regions
[SPEAKER_13]: into a social media area where we can do
group voting.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we'll grow all the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_13]: People will test.
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll make hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll do all the things that we do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and then around this time next year,
we'll get together on social media and
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of work through and say, okay,
in the Humboldt region, um, have kept
[SPEAKER_13]: pulled a couple of couple of killer males
and they got this and that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we all of a sudden want to use his
males and Eric found a cool female.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, Hey, you two guys do this project
and maybe, you know, maybe Nicholas will
[SPEAKER_13]: actually do the breeding and, you know,
and then we can even take that further and
[SPEAKER_13]: structure it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to incorporate technology in the
blockchain so that we can incorporate a
[SPEAKER_13]: payment structure so that people that do
the work can get paid as we end up selling
[SPEAKER_13]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then everyone that, that,
that took part in the conference,
[SPEAKER_13]: we'll also potentially get dividend back
down the line.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I kind of broke it out and,
uh, a very simple sales plan, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: two years from now, you can get paid back
your, your ticket purchase just through
[SPEAKER_13]: participating in this process.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, I think it's really cool and
it'll be really fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, you know, big thanks to Kev for
kind of helping inspire that, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: and getting the seeds that we get to do
this with, um, the, if you don't,
[SPEAKER_13]: if you guys don't know root beer is,
uh, from Minji and from Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and the ChemDoc special reserve is,
uh, from aficionado that Leo had.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so Leo gifted the pollen to Jean and
Jean made these seeds and gifted them to
[SPEAKER_13]: Kev and he held on to him for a while.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the ChemDoc, uh, you know,
Kev, you could probably talk about the
[SPEAKER_13]: ChemDoc a little bit more than I could,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the, the seeds are probably,
I don't know, eight years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it was back when they all rolled
together as a crew and they gave me the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock and I just put it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years later, when root beer gets
blistering hot, I went through my
[SPEAKER_00]: collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remembered I had something connected to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just thought, you know,
you and I, Josh and I were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how do we add value to the
region?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you connect people into a
collaborative project that allows many
[SPEAKER_00]: people to work together to find common
benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you tap into lines that have a
heavy traction, it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the main point is that you get to
have people work together, sifting stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing collaborative breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that root beer is the first gen root
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the subsequent generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nobody with that plant in seed
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's that old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything that's been released root beer
is a cross, a BX2, a BX3.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, and, and, and so, and Jean knows
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for me, you know, when I grab your
jeans, if you want me to put them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just really respect to the
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I moved jeans continuously,
but I don't step on anybody's toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with Jean, you know, he's about it
because it's a good project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that chem dog special was a project
they did up in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say star dog, like Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's controversial in all its little
permutations and how it all happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main point is that chem dog
special line with some really good herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the female that won that 2012
cup in hand and Ellie and Leo had the
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they took the pollen and threw it
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with the chem dog special
is it's so dominant in its profile that it
[SPEAKER_00]: masks a lot of the stuff you hit it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be able to make sure you do
a large enough population hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get what you want, which is that gas
tone, but with other nuances from the
[SPEAKER_00]: female present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the black lime reserved, if you look
through the population, you'll pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: the right ones that have the lime that's
intense, but still has that gaseous
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the same with the root beer is
that you just have to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that when you opened the
pack, you found some killers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said you got one that was
like, like vanilla soda.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, one that was total vanilla soda.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just trying to, you got to tie the
people together in a way to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: really, you form community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community is a fucking great word,
but what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means collaborative effort and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what a community is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where people put effort in and
support each other and do your best you
[SPEAKER_00]: can to be a human race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea of like letting the Regen
Conference be a place where people can get
[SPEAKER_00]: together to do projects that transcend
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in two years, you'll see the
ramifications of that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did another one too,
where I was able to access a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stock out of Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to the group in Afghanistan
and said, Hey, what I want to do is I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to give the seeds out for
free in limited quantities so that people
[SPEAKER_00]: can access the stock and what it does,
it drives attention to farmers and
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, but I got hit up by an
Afghani guy that was telling me I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking a colonialist and I was screwing
the Afghanis by giving these seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, but it was Afghanis that
sent me the seed and it was Afghanis that
[SPEAKER_00]: told me to give them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a question of how do you send
value back to the farmers because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same situation we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to figure out,
you know, how do you really drive
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to people who are struggling?
[SPEAKER_00]: And allow there to be benefit in a world
that's really difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least what we'll do is we'll take
these Zani Afghani lines and I'll give
[SPEAKER_00]: packs of them out at the four different
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just lets people access stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 200 bucks a pack if you bought
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to give out, you know,
like 20 packs at each event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it'll do is it'll allow people to
get really good stock that you can access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should allow people to do two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should allow you to do preservation
where you keep the line pure so that what
[SPEAKER_00]: you have is you have the connection to the
past and then out cross it, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing around with in addition
to bring some of those unique profiles and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid ratios into modern cultivars
so that you get rid of some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: blandness that's happening in the quality
of the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're driving cannabis for morphological
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive it for numerical traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive it for a lot of shit,
but I really don't care about any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do for the market, but in terms
of what I want for cannabis, what I want
[SPEAKER_00]: is I want really good cannabis that lifts
me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, the ability
for all of us to work together in this
[SPEAKER_00]: form is just awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say really quick that one
of the most potent strains we grew this
[SPEAKER_04]: year was a Tangieland chem special reserve
number four and the chem special reserve
[SPEAKER_04]: number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure where it came from,
but it came from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the male I put in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's true that every we grew a bunch
of different chem special reserve number
[SPEAKER_04]: four because we had there was a person in
Eugene up in Oregon who grew it and made
[SPEAKER_04]: some seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does dominate the profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way Tangie dominates the profile,
it was this amazing union and it had like
[SPEAKER_04]: dark blue tones to the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was super interesting and just fire
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought it to the unicorn cup in the
area here and we didn't enter it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was a wow moment, you know,
to putting it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, knowing your terpene profiles and
how dominant they can be and bringing two
[SPEAKER_04]: together, two dominant ones can be really
obviously pretty powerful.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number four, Kevin really is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got the resistance in it,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I had it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So right next to it, I had the mean mug,
which is a GMO root beer BX cross root
[SPEAKER_13]: beer BX, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They couldn't handle it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They grew well.
[SPEAKER_13]: They looked good.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when the pressure came, they folded at
the end.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they do get in the greenhouse,
but it just kind of was very clear to see
[SPEAKER_13]: what the chem dye was throwing in there,
you know, in that instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when it first popped out,
we dug through it and we just at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you know, we would just release some
material into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people had access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started releasing mails into the
system that I had used that really threw
[SPEAKER_00]: some interesting traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just I was releasing it all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't selling the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really so that people had
access to some stuff that they gave them
[SPEAKER_00]: some value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just funny because all the
years down the road, you still see all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff popping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that that's the whole
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why I love being,
you know, to be invited to be part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative crew is that it's just really
a healthy human group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's just really refreshing
because it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets you feel like you're alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is just basically you just
keep your head down and move your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get to do work with other
people in a in a in a genuine way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's enriching.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to ask you, Kev, did you ever
find any perennial genetics in the small?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you've grown quite a bit of it or
worked with people that have worked with
[SPEAKER_07]: quite a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I I started to tap into it,
but then I ran out of space and so I never
[SPEAKER_00]: got to dive deep into the small
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran some hybrids, but they had been
hybridized down to where they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable finish time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've I've never got a chance to run
the two year cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where it's going to grow for a
year, then flower the next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a biennial.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it, and it's it's just really a
matter of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have so much space and time to
chase all your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I end up chasing so much shit that I I
end up cutting most of my personal life
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have kids and try to make sure that
my kids get priority and then everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else comes after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it you you can only take on so much
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm fascinated with the small work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wanted to go to the.
[SPEAKER_07]: From out there, we didn't find any there,
but there is I still have 12 seeds left
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting in Zimbabwe, which is very close
in latitude, which I thought if I if I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: going to have that expression,
that's where I'm going to have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are going to once we get fired back
up again, we're going to pop those.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just we're working on CBD early on,
but everything is still kind of on pause
[SPEAKER_07]: due to the virus and basically the
inability to export stuff through South
[SPEAKER_07]: Africa right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the last year and a half,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate being on here with
everybody here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect everybody that's here and and
and really appreciate everybody's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like hearing about people talking about
the turbines and the gather, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: as those come.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you as you develop that and then you
cross them back against something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this comes back to what Josh,
you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh and Kelly Dragonfly just getting to
that blend really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it seems like if you've got one
polyhybrid and you've got one inbred line
[SPEAKER_02]: and you cross them to get a dominated
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got two really solid,
predictable, at least in one level traits
[SPEAKER_02]: and in this case, maybe terpenes and you
go back and put them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens, it seems, based on COAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've done is it brings both of
those terpene groups in and complexifies
[SPEAKER_02]: the end result and gives you, say,
if you have a terpene dominant and you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a mere seen dominant and you make a
real F1 with two F6s or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you end up seeing is a collaborative
joining and strengthening and overall
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene numbers, which, you know,
this is the kind of stuff that I've just
[SPEAKER_02]: been kind of one season at a time just
looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm stoked that other people are as
interested in that stuff and looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: it, because I think when we all come
together and start to share these
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, we really can further the
potential of really nuanced stuff within
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I have to get going because I
got a little one who's going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: take over the space and get a nap here
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how to use this thing
that well as I can't even tell who's on
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have my wife set it up and I don't
know how to write, say goodbye and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just wanted to say that it was a
pleasure being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to be in a room with you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make a little more sense to me,
but thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good seeing some faces that I
haven't seen in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to the conference.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheers, homie.
[SPEAKER_13]: I look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_13]: Eric, Eric, what's going on with you and
genetics?
[SPEAKER_13]: You got anything that you're you're
excited about these days?
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you're a big cash head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I'm excited about all kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I feel like whenever I run into
someone, there's something exciting going
[SPEAKER_06]: on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, for right now, a genetic
acquisition is really a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like for small farms and big farms,
just because things get watered down
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty easy out there in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not all cuts are the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's, you know, you know,
people are talking about this stuff on
[SPEAKER_06]: LinkedIn and social other social media
platforms on the fact that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of the genetics out there are really
hyped up by the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, the selection process from
nursery to nursery or farm to farm is
[SPEAKER_06]: quite different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so some of these things get turned
into means when, in fact, they are,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, quite fascinating when you have
the right cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think it's really going to be up
to farms and and people in general to
[SPEAKER_06]: really get this selection process figured
out because you can have a hype name and
[SPEAKER_06]: be a complete winner in some cases.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, you can,
you know, have some of these great names.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a complete shitter at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the shitters of what's gotten
propelled in California through a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: these nurseries just by maybe it's just
been by accident.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it looked like a winner at first,
but it didn't turn out to stay that way or
[SPEAKER_06]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But and because of the hoplite and viroid,
the nursery side of the things are really
[SPEAKER_06]: getting difficult, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, people are turning the
seeds more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's why I say the selection
process is really, you know, the next key
[SPEAKER_06]: strategy and learning how to do that
properly from farm to farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the interpretation is different
from person to person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Place to place, but sourcing the right
seeds, picking the right winner out of
[SPEAKER_06]: those and trying to circumnavigate some of
this nursery stuff while this,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, hop situation gets dealt with.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, tissue culture is definitely an
option, too, as long as the SOPs are
[SPEAKER_06]: followed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just see it's kind of a difficult
time right now for certain farms to
[SPEAKER_06]: navigate things when when, you know,
we've got, you know, brands to kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: fulfill or names to fill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also are trying to get healthy
plants passed around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it even makes it hard to pass things
around like we used to.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are more reluctant to pass around
to cut any more than they are sharing some
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and it's.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just lost my train of thought,
damn stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there is there an OG cut still an
original OG cut rolling around grass grass
[SPEAKER_04]: valley zone, because I know that you're a
huge lover of the original OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude, it's so fucking hard to find
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it used to be just, you know,
everything was OG gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, man, and I buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple of people around here
that have the original one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I talked to somebody the other day
just about getting the sack to smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't you know, I'm not worried about
exactly getting the cut and growing it
[SPEAKER_06]: myself anymore just because of where I'm
at these days and my traveling and ability
[SPEAKER_06]: to, you know, you know, farm at the same
time, especially keeping some cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plants around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I just like to smoke it,
you know, like the beta cariophylline
[SPEAKER_06]: things cool and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's definitely some tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, when you want
to sit down and smoke your gas,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a little bit harder to get to.
[SPEAKER_06]: But seeing the genetics out there is
amazing because I was just actually in
[SPEAKER_06]: Florida at a farm that's, you know,
trying to deal with genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of bushy plants and
things that are called OG and pushed and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they really just in the in as far as
looking at a plant as a teen even don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have the characteristics that the real OG
had.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all of a sudden, when you do see
it, it's like, wow, it's almost like
[SPEAKER_06]: something you haven't seen in a long time,
stretches really far, not a lot of sites
[SPEAKER_06]: just, you know, starts to want to lean
over.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like a plant that you see in
the wintertime that doesn't get enough
[SPEAKER_06]: light.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just elongate and stretch.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, under the right conditions
with the right light, everything's doing
[SPEAKER_06]: fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you look over and see those OGs just
stretch out like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go, wow, that's something I
haven't seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's no wonder in some cases that it's
not in production as much just as,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, some of those original ones
aren't the biggest producers in this day
[SPEAKER_06]: and age.
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially the price of cannabis and
Cali, you got to get the most bang for
[SPEAKER_06]: your buck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting that the sour diesel
mother clone has still really kind of you
[SPEAKER_04]: can find it, you know, and it's
interesting how that one stayed pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: steady is just like, bam, we got the sour
diesel, you know, and I love that that's
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I'm just a little curious about
how Kang and water is used in the nursery.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have already talked about that,
but it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a sack for you, Eric, when you come
in, when you come in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know me, I still have all the original
shit and I still grow for myself because I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to smoke OG and I'll bring you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to come up for the region.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I signed up for the fucking
gonjie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it took me a minute to get signed up,
but I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've been a big fan ever since you
developed the concept and getting the
[SPEAKER_06]: community together and going to the spring
kickoff was a big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, going to the golden tarp awards.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember speaking at the one of the
first golden tarp awards and I'm not
[SPEAKER_06]: really a public speaker by any accounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of just had to do with something I
felt like I had to do in the business side
[SPEAKER_06]: of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when I was at the golden tarp
awards, they didn't have a projector.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was the first time that I did a
presentation without a slide screen
[SPEAKER_06]: because I kind of use that to move me
along.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was more off the cuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember using my hands so much that
I banged into the microphone and knocked
[SPEAKER_06]: it over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a nervous fucking wreck,
but yeah, man, it's going to be good to
[SPEAKER_06]: hang out and go through the process.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited and impressed with what you
guys have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, the beauty of the ganjie
is that, you know, we use those four
[SPEAKER_00]: categories of perception as the
classifications and a woman named Ellen
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland just released a really good book
called Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first 90 pages of it are the four
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next section is all the craft
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't you in that season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in Weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I in Weed?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in that book, Weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of craft farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she brought in to talk about all the
different production methodologies which
[SPEAKER_00]: drive quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first third of the book is all
based off of my four categorical
[SPEAKER_00]: divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it does is it starts just to
allow us to be able to use some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified but accurate methods of
explanation so that what you get is you
[SPEAKER_00]: get an ability to have conversations with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you start taking them into
you, you start take down the metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: route, you lose people too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you want to be able to do is get
enthused, not wow them with your
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible fucking memory of recollection
of what profiles are present, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like a banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot easier to say than it has
osmine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you when you put it all
together, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a matter of of, you know,
trying to work together where we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different skill sets from all of
us to present information that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: people to make better choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more better for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just better, better choices in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really like the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the location, we're going to shift it
from my spot at the one log because the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies equity program goes in this
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get an equity program where you
got Chris Webber out of Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put together a huge facility in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're having people that qualify as
equity participants from around the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: fly up to us to spend a couple of months
at the one log so they can get an
[SPEAKER_00]: education on basically what's the new
industry and also how do you use your
[SPEAKER_00]: equity situation to your best potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the issue that you have
these individuals with equity ability,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they end up getting fucked because you
kind of use it as a door to get into a
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is what they get is a
stipend, not generational wealth,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what you should get from these
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have an ability to create
something fucking long term that benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: for time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we run that program at the one
log, it'll take over the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Derek has a beautiful location up
in Salmon Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got like a 200 acre location in
Salmon Creek where we're going to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: events and it'll be killer because we'll
be able to bring farmers in and it'll be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot easier for people to come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been a really good program and
the feedback's been excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main point is just trying to be
able to get the public to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: better what it is they buy and why they
buy it so that you empower them to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the right choices, be it whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the smaller farmer, the quality of
product is where we shine because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bring cultivars forward that are
not on the five pounds per 25 square foot
[SPEAKER_00]: metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going for quality of experience
more than I'm getting X amount out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that can happen is if the
price is above $400 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have some really cool shit I'm
working on, but I'll break all that out at
[SPEAKER_00]: the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your boy been busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, it sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've always loved the fact that we
qualify the weed based on the smells,
[SPEAKER_06]: like not all these other reports and THC
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, I mean, the hemp people
had to do that, you know, with the
[SPEAKER_06]: phytology and the phyto facts and,
you know, some of that stuff is based on
[SPEAKER_06]: smokable flower being terpene driven
because you're not looking for how much
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD it has.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, combining some of these
things with what you've done and what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're talking about to educate people on
this terpene aspect of a qualitative,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, way of looking at cannabis is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to get the chain of
distribution, not to fuck it up in
[SPEAKER_06]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the issue is, I mean,
that's the issue we go into is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how do you approach the business
you're in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the issue is that you take this
beautiful product at the farm and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: do a supply chain that's as fucking broken
as could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time the end person consumes
it, it's trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like for me, when I'm doing
breeding projects right now, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I'm working on is we're doing
holdability testing to find out what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation when it's not held in
refrigerated stasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it actually retain any qualities?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does the plant have an ability to
handle the vibration and movement through
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply chain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've never seen a container that
wasn't kicked and pushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, like they just get beat
to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we create plants that fit that
reality so that what you have is you have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that can make it through the
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of the fine product,
I would say, like, what's a good example?
[SPEAKER_00]: That white thorn rose that Casale does,
it makes some of the best I've smoked in
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of the profile is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flowers are gorgeous, but they
don't hold up to supply chain movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem is if he puts that
flower in the system and it doesn't move
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly, it gets destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up making Johnny look like
he's an inferior farmer with an inferior
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it couldn't be any further from the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great farmer and he's got a great
product, but the system screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the best you can to fix
problems in the short term so that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: marketability and movement of product for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, you're developing,
it's almost like a duality of what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is Epicurean and the other one
is just dealing with the fact that the
[SPEAKER_00]: system's fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't get paid, you're not
staying alive as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have something that can
make it through the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to have hot numbers, has to have
agronomic abilities, and it has to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other product that you can
release in limited form that really allows
[SPEAKER_00]: you to have an identity as a craft
producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's important to note that this
week in California, a lot of small family
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers and craft farmers went to
Sacramento to lobby at the Capitol
[SPEAKER_04]: building.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of love to every person that
showed up to Capitol building.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Supernova Woman on Instagram,
I think, is one woman that, or one group
[SPEAKER_04]: that covered the event, Alp and Glow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really important to note that as
we talk about regenerative farming,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have to continue, like season does,
so many people just work actively with
[SPEAKER_04]: creating the environment to embody what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of people in California,
they can't even make products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to be an amazing grower with
products that embody what you're doing on
[SPEAKER_04]: the land, because you ultimately have to
give it to a whole other entity and hope
[SPEAKER_04]: that they represent you in the right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a global issue with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just make everyone in the world feel-
It's a global issue with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's just feel represented.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everywhere in the world that people
are fighting corporate entities.
[SPEAKER_04]: India, it's huge in India at this moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thailand, you say, oh, it's legal in
Thailand, but a lot of our friends in
[SPEAKER_04]: Thailand are having a really hard time
finding something authentic that
[SPEAKER_04]: represents Thai cannabis in their market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very university driven and very
corporate driven.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very important to us as a global
community to continue to work on when we
[SPEAKER_04]: say support the small farmer, it's
supporting farm gate sales and the ability
[SPEAKER_04]: for farmers to create their own products
and get it to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can still have requirements that
make the products up to standards and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But having to be separate from your retail
chain, it kills the consumer too,
[SPEAKER_04]: because then you get limited amount of
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the end, you're trying to find a lot
of products to fit an ailment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the recreational or legalization,
it's very limited on what you can get.
[SPEAKER_10]: And farms would be amazingly
[SPEAKER_10]: set of herbs to work with, along with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be nice to see that
represented as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to throw a toss in.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're right in Washington.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're nine years in and they threw up a
bill.
[SPEAKER_13]: I posted earlier in this week to do direct
farm sales.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the way we're structured, a little
different than California.
[SPEAKER_13]: In order for me to get product to store,
I have a processor license and that
[SPEAKER_13]: license lets me do anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could make food if I was able to put in
a septic system.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't, but I wanted to put them in the
septic system and have a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do that on my property.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could make whatever products I wanted,
period.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could even add in blasting and whatever
sort of processing I wanted under the sun,
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would maybe require some additional fire
stuff, but with this direct farm thing,
[SPEAKER_13]: it really gives me the ability to do craft
things.
[SPEAKER_13]: My testimony when I got on the public
thing Friday was, hey, I want to do maybe
[SPEAKER_13]: one event a month tops, like maybe
quarterly, maybe twice a year have an
[SPEAKER_13]: event where I sell some products direct,
have an educational event and have some of
[SPEAKER_13]: my products available on the side type
thing and make it real low in the maybe
[SPEAKER_13]: sell to my neighbors as they came by.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it would be huge for our family
because even though I have the ability and
[SPEAKER_13]: all those licenses in order for me to take
it on, I can't do it personally by myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: I need a whole processing facility.
[SPEAKER_13]: I need a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: I need employees to even to get herb into
the store.
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of started down this paths and then
I realized and learned how challenging it
[SPEAKER_13]: is similar to what Nick was saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like, this isn't what I want to
do when I signed up for this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't want to learn how to run a
sticker printer and do graphic design and
[SPEAKER_13]: test this cannabis for all this shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to grow and farm and those laws.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just backing it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're in Washington, please
support.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_13]: In Washington, I've watched and been a
little bit a part of this stuff for a
[SPEAKER_13]: decade now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the legislators really do hear the
voice of the people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Email in or just taking the time to send
in a written testimony does a lot,
[SPEAKER_13]: at least in our state and in our state
support small farmers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so as they hear that, what a big
impact.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's my little plug on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: What you were going to say, Kev?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have an issue that because the
United States is the destination sale for
[SPEAKER_00]: most of these countries that I work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having this incredible conundrum
about how do they get the products that
[SPEAKER_00]: are from their area into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market and be accepted because we're
obsessed with morphology, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Americans are obsessed with looks of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the tie are trying to reclassify
how cannabis is viewed so that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: use as one of the criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm trying to help the groups
that I work with understand that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: really the two markets you create the
internal market in your country where you
[SPEAKER_00]: specialize and focus on what is
indigenous, what is your base form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you can create other
things that are hybrids to move globally
[SPEAKER_00]: that will work in supply chain shipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is the destination, it's almost like
everyone wants to throw everything they're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating out and come after what sells
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it couldn't be a worse decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, whoa, if I went to Thailand,
I want to smoke Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in Laos, I want to smoke Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sold me a fucking bag of white
runs, I'd be pissed because I can buy that
[SPEAKER_00]: in anywhere in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't buy Thai in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grow it, but it's not Thai because I
don't have the sun in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the I don't have the
combination to make it what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an it's an Americanized,
bastardized, diminished form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that because I get I get to
fuck around with all these things in real
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what's tough is that
we're all we're all so busy trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to sell weed that you're
you're creating the square tomato so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it boxes easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ships easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're losing is we're losing this
diversity and we're losing the ability for
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of these places to have their own
individual identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so same thing with Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're developing lines in Colombia,
but there has to be hybrids that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: sold other places that desire American
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you develop the internal
markets within the country to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: what is their cultural smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like these these
conversations are huge and it there has to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the farmers have to be able to get
together and communicate so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw your population away to become
a runs farmer, because when runs goes
[SPEAKER_00]: away, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've you've lost your
identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're just basically your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grab whatever the industry sells and
you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling people, I'm like, listen,
they sell about 18 different plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow any of those, you're going out
of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't you can't compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Eric, Eric is similar to me,
where he and I both go to the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: operations in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go to ones out of the country
that are fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets you get a really good idea of what
your competition is and what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you can't compete with these
guys because they can get the product to
[SPEAKER_00]: the table cheaper than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get out of their realm and you
have to go into things that they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce, won't produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue with that is how do we
market it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is you can't go and
chase large producers as a technique when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not a large producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's that's where I love the
idea of the Root Bear Chem Dog Special
[SPEAKER_00]: Project is that what it does, it allows a
tremendous number of people that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: brought together through the region
conference to be able to get access to a
[SPEAKER_00]: common breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of a year or two,
what you come out of with all those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: is really the true outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're doing is you're having
people from around the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully global participate in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have is communication,
participation and movement of product that
[SPEAKER_00]: starts that chain of events to occur where
what you're doing is you're using many
[SPEAKER_00]: people to create things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think any of us are so
uniquely bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of that, I don't know
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have a hundred of us,
we seem to have a far better picture on
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do and how to go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we really go after the market
in the way we need so that the small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer has some ability to survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nobody's living on four hundred
bucks a pound winning Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's running you almost like by the time
you're done with tax and trimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're already at fucking three fifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in the you're in this range,
of course, that's a nickel below what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to sell it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do business like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's killing the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globally, I don't care what country I'm
in, it's the same issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Selling flowers is the lowest price that
you'll get for your, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: for your product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so making products from your flower
value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where hash and rosin,
you know, come in, because that's that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: product at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in some cases, you can't make it
or maybe you don't want to because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: too much infrastructure and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's that's the idea of
there is there's places in Ontario right
[SPEAKER_04]: now where there are pounds or twenty five
dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just talking to people out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the big up to the families
out there that are doing that hash and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything, because that still has value,
you know, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And taking away the ability for the farmer
to have a value added product with their
[SPEAKER_09]: own, you know, product with their own
produce is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like telling the tomato farmer,
hey, you know what, tomato farmer,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can't make tomato sauce when really,
you know, maybe for small tomato farmers,
[SPEAKER_09]: the only way that they can actually stay a
small farmer, feed their family,
[SPEAKER_09]: pay their taxes is to make a value added
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think that it's, again,
another restrictive policy that's put onto
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis farmers is if we're growing
something other than produce or another
[SPEAKER_09]: crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that that's the stigma that
needs to be lifted.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the direction that we all need
to move into is the ability for us to work
[SPEAKER_09]: with our sentient beings that we're
talking talking about from the very
[SPEAKER_09]: beginning to the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if Kevin is growing something that he
knows that what's being put out to the
[SPEAKER_09]: market is what he originally grew,
what he intended to put out to the market
[SPEAKER_09]: to consumers.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's incredibly important for farmers
because we want that essence, that energy
[SPEAKER_09]: of the good tasting, good nutritional
tomato to be able to be shown to community
[SPEAKER_09]: in the way that, you know, you encompassed
your energy and your intention into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to take important
medicine, especially take time in
[SPEAKER_04]: Thailand, for example, like if they
started making products out of Thai spices
[SPEAKER_04]: and Thai roots and the Ayurvedic Chinese
medicine mashup that happens in Thailand,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I mean, you'd find incredible
products coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or let's say Yoruba in Nigeria,
West Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's really important roots and
tonics that come from from these areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be able to compound medicine,
even compound compounding cannabis is
[SPEAKER_04]: banned in some areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the ability to compound
cannabis with other products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what he means by compounding is
literally just taking two herbs and
[SPEAKER_09]: putting them together.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how restrictive this has gotten.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, come on, silliness.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to compare us putting
spearmint into cannabis leaves for a
[SPEAKER_09]: smoking blend as to that of mixing two
pharmaceutical drugs to go together.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have now created loops that we can no
longer fit into.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so stupid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Humans are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are always creating these systems that
we can't even work in.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that if we've learned anything
through these last two years is we need to
[SPEAKER_09]: simplify and we need to humanize more
things so that it makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why they've complicated a
system is so that we have to pay somebody
[SPEAKER_09]: else not only to translate it,
but then to be able to carry out the work
[SPEAKER_09]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what it does is it just takes us
further and further away from the work and
[SPEAKER_09]: empowerment of us becoming, again,
sovereign, independent beings.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is where we need to move not just
in cannabis, not just in farming,
[SPEAKER_13]: but in every single occupant in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that you're using that vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really strikes me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I identify with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_13]: When we were talking about hash and stuff,
I would just really agree with the direct
[SPEAKER_13]: sale and you taking it beyond hash because
right now in Washington, California is
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of almost like its own country in a
way.
[SPEAKER_13]: The cannabis industry can operate because
it's so huge, but we only have 600,
[SPEAKER_13]: 700 farmer producers, processors,
and there's a ton of folks in the hash
[SPEAKER_13]: game.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone that used to be doing a small
home grow convinced the guy who was having
[SPEAKER_13]: a hard time to let him spend 10 grand and
put up a hash lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in the market, we have really high
quality rosin, especially hash rosin,
[SPEAKER_13]: available for 60 bucks, 50 bucks a gram.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty decent stuff all the way up
to $75 a gram.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're in that $60 range,
$65 range, it's some $800 a pound to the
[SPEAKER_13]: farmer is my point.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you break it down, it's not much and
you have to have that expensive lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to do this extra thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have to still package it and put
it all out into one gram units.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've really delved into it this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to make a lot of hash back in the
medical days and I took a break from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I hop back in this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I broke down the economics and I
have a friend who owns a store here and
[SPEAKER_13]: he's really cool and he'll sell anything I
give him.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when I start working through the
volume that I have to do, it's just kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of like a non-starter.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just keep coming back to like,
I need to reduce this down to a real
[SPEAKER_13]: neighborhood nursery that people can come
by.
[SPEAKER_13]: My neighbors can come by and they can buy
some clones, some seedlings, a couple
[SPEAKER_13]: ounces of herb, maybe some honey infused
honey.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like these basic products that I've sold,
these things that I'm already doing that
[SPEAKER_13]: are just simple healing things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it can be like once a month or
whatever, like a couple of people,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm cool enough that I'll let them drop by
whenever, just how we would normally do
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to big up LOS Gardens out in
Ontario, Sean and Subsidium Secreto and
[SPEAKER_04]: the crew that came together.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won an award off of Sun Grown
Medicine, Sun Grown Roger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in Toronto recently and Toronto,
that was a big beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all working out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people that we're working
in the DEM Pure Network that are creating
[SPEAKER_04]: like that farm gate, food network,
even conscious meats, regenerative meat
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some cases, in some places in the
world, you can't even get like say meat or
[SPEAKER_04]: raw milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be able to provide that for the
community is also a microbial rich entity
[SPEAKER_04]: that you'd like to get into your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, mix and matching the food
sovereignty along with the medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: sovereignty is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is happening in different parts of
the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, give thanks to the people that
are creating networks in their area to
[SPEAKER_04]: provide their community with intentional
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because processed food is, not very good
for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And processed medicine is not the best for
us as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know where we're at.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been going for a while, two and a
half hours.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you talking to Josh?
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead, Josh.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but anyway, and that's the spirit of
the regenerative conference and everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: coming together is that you're
highlighting each bio region and what they
[SPEAKER_04]: can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on this panel right now, you already
have people in every different area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Canada, we can't make new licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not the way the law works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, we can make a new license,
but we can't alter the licenses that are
[SPEAKER_04]: there currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that's the kind of work that we're
looking and moving forward is,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, can we create a new addendum?
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to the laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in Canada is a good representation
of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a federally legalized country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how does regenerative farming and
lifestyles fit into that federally
[SPEAKER_04]: legalized markup?
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this moment, it really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't match.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just sort of wanted to remind
everybody out there that Health Canada is
[SPEAKER_09]: what handles our license here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's like our health and medical
system.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not our agricultural system.
[SPEAKER_09]: That Canada Ag has nothing to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that can really tell you the wormholes
of where cannabis is going, which is
[SPEAKER_09]: pharmaceutical drug involved, because
that's what they know.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going with what it is that they
know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can see how incredibly detrimental
this is that Canada being one of the main
[SPEAKER_09]: big countries that's federally legalized
cannabis has taken it into a federally
[SPEAKER_09]: legalized faction of the pharmaceutical
trickle down, if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think that that's the wrong way
to go if we're talking about small
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for us to be able to have a
conversation with the government of Canada
[SPEAKER_09]: and say, hey, there's a whole other
faction of cannabis that's going on that
[SPEAKER_09]: isn't just pharmaceutical grade,
that isn't just talking about drug mixing
[SPEAKER_09]: and isolation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about farming and this being
used as a product that small farmers can
[SPEAKER_09]: have in addition to their multi-crop,
their multi-products on their properties.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that these conversations are
incredibly important, and especially
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada, because if we're able to get
Canada to make that movement, then the
[SPEAKER_09]: rest of the world looks at it,
oh, we're going to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, hey, there is a small area for
farmers to be able to bring up different
[SPEAKER_09]: parts of maybe what they're trying to
accomplish in the federal government,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is basically they're not even making
any money in cannabis, at least in the way
[SPEAKER_09]: that they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the promises that these big
corporate entities made with Health
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada, they're not necessarily getting
that percentage back.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was promised out to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even that's not working.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's still a network there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're thankful that Canada has federally
legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It opens a door.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are intentional businesses out there
coming online.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is good medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Marcus knows and works with a lot
of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whistler Technologies works with a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: More and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of regenerative farmers
that are entering the licensed producer
[SPEAKER_04]: market here in Canada that are continuing
to lobby every day for certain
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients, even nets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to lobby to put nettles in their
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it becomes really crazy when you're
talking about sacred herbalist
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative farming, and then you look at
the actual system you're trying to work
[SPEAKER_04]: with and you're like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they create a hoop that's this
big, and then only they isolate
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe too soon.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're thankful.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot to be thankful for.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I put that post up, there's a handful
of folks that are like, yeah, but this
[SPEAKER_13]: type of person can take advantage of it or
this type of, you know what I'm like.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one step at a time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I literally had a recreational license for
nine years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one step at a time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been saying I need this thing
like I used to sell direct my products in
[SPEAKER_13]: Minnesota walk into chefs and with buy it
and they buy it for not what I can do
[SPEAKER_13]: right no I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just go and the reason why that's not
only is it suppor but it's supporting the
[SPEAKER_09]: that's fresh food that you have to offer
right at that time these terpenes of what
[SPEAKER_09]: the farmer has created off their farm and
the way that they want to cure it is very
[SPEAKER_09]: different in the end which is exactly very
different than you know dare I say a
[SPEAKER_09]: rotten tomato so much of the fresh flowers
or that people are putting out creates a
[SPEAKER_09]: certain type of entourage medicine and
then when it's on the shelves it's not
[SPEAKER_09]: treated properly or it's gone through
another process or darn if it's even
[SPEAKER_09]: contaminated with another farm that isn't
using organic things at the very least it
[SPEAKER_09]: can cause so many problems and to me
that's really just the same as going to a
[SPEAKER_09]: market with a bunch of rotten tomatoes and
saying this is what I have to offer them
[SPEAKER_09]: market it isn't representative of the
small farmer and it is only harming us to
[SPEAKER_09]: be able to have value in you know the
history I mean into the future of what
[SPEAKER_09]: small farming should even have it isn't
representing how dare I
[SPEAKER_13]: honestly will not eat tomatoes that are
store-bought like even at the we at the we
[SPEAKER_13]: shop the co-op and that good food and I
know most of farmers but the tomatoes that
[SPEAKER_13]: they have to grow for them to sit for a
week don't fucking dive with my mouth you
[SPEAKER_13]: know I'll only buy the stuff at the
farmers market or grow my own you know and
[SPEAKER_13]: it's and I basically don't eat tomatoes
unless I've grown because up here folks
[SPEAKER_09]: you know they have all sorts of green and
how many of us would say that as
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivators of cannabis we really only
smoke what's super close to us and ingest
[SPEAKER_09]: what's super close to us because we know
you know it that we know it has the value
[SPEAKER_09]: it has the flavor that we're all looking
for for us to want to smoke somebody
[SPEAKER_09]: else's product you know it it's to me the
same as that tomato that even though it
[SPEAKER_09]: may be good it's been on the shelf for a
really long time to finally get to the
[SPEAKER_09]: consumer so we need to have a lot of
compassion for consumers in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: market especially in Canada not receiving
what it is that the producers or the
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivators even wanted to put out and to
shout up the tomato a little bit our
[SPEAKER_04]: friends at peace seedlings uh grew 200
different strains of tomatoes so wow
[SPEAKER_04]: seedlings 200 yeah yeah peace seedlings
.blogspot.com you can find incredible food
[SPEAKER_09]: seeds and they've been growing 200
different varietals of tomatoes for about
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 years along with incredible flower
varietals where's their farm corvallis
[SPEAKER_04]: corvallis nice I'll definitely check it
out yeah and they're yeah their father
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Capular we had on on hash church one
time uh he's a genetic biologist uh in his
[SPEAKER_04]: 70s and peace seeds was his company and
his kids run peace seedlings so everyone
[SPEAKER_09]: should know about Alan Capular and just
the as if we're talking about all these
[SPEAKER_09]: incredible varietals of cannabis because
we can because it's still here because
[SPEAKER_09]: it's still relevant to consumers you know
fast forward us talking about you know 70
[SPEAKER_09]: different varietals of broccoli we would
lose all of the people who are listening
[SPEAKER_09]: right now and they're just the same as if
20 years down the road we're talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: all these different varietals that have
now been CRISPR technology in Israel right
[SPEAKER_09]: now and they're going to put out four
different varietals of cannabis where all
[SPEAKER_09]: of these 70 different varietals that we're
talking about right now have no value in
[SPEAKER_09]: people's minds they have no idea what
we're talking about but yet this is what's
[SPEAKER_09]: going to bring us to the future so that's
why it's so important that we continue to
[SPEAKER_09]: bring this forward because we know the
degradation that has happened to the food
[SPEAKER_09]: industry for us to only have four
different varietals of broccoli and we
[SPEAKER_04]: don't believe in editing the genome of
foods through CRISPR technology we believe
[SPEAKER_04]: in bigging up the genome through
regenerative polyculture seed saving
[SPEAKER_04]: that's our future our future is in the
unknown the soil microbiome and how
[SPEAKER_04]: endophytic bacteria and fungi store
themselves in seeds to create a new you
[SPEAKER_09]: know plant the following year and yes we
do believe that it's a short track to
[SPEAKER_09]: health and well-being of the cannabis
plant in the same way that antibiotics is
[SPEAKER_09]: a short track to the health and well-being
of our microbiology I said it I'm sorry I
[SPEAKER_09]: know that humans love to go down these
long roads of science but when we start
[SPEAKER_09]: CRISPR technology you know all of the
varietals that have taken our ancestry
[SPEAKER_09]: thousands of years to get here and we just
maybe ruin it with some great idea that
[SPEAKER_09]: the human has when we really have no idea
what's going to happen to the future of
[SPEAKER_09]: those seeds so even though we can look
into you know a very small picture of what
[SPEAKER_09]: this may do it's awesome to have questions
about it but what we continue seeing is
[SPEAKER_09]: that those questions now are taking over
industry right left and center it's not
[SPEAKER_09]: just oh let us question because we have
these ideas but when it then takes over an
[SPEAKER_09]: entire industry then you realize it's not
just us questioning it the how what and
[SPEAKER_09]: why because we are curious it's because
it's there to take over the world and and
[SPEAKER_13]: we really need to
[SPEAKER_13]: take it down those lines and hold it and
remake it year after year because it in my
[SPEAKER_13]: experience it takes two or three seasons
or rows for a genetic to really jive with
[SPEAKER_13]: the biology you know and like you know
that that's true of human beings too and
[SPEAKER_13]: when we move and move into different
environments different places it takes
[SPEAKER_13]: people get sick often you know in the
first while it takes their biome
[SPEAKER_13]: especially if you drastically move to a
different part of the world you know you
[SPEAKER_13]: could really fuck you up you know so it's
just us to consider like to not get rid of
[SPEAKER_13]: that machismo thing or whatever the fuck
it is and like make seeds you know like
[SPEAKER_13]: and that's why I always I appreciate
hearing about peace seedlings because I've
[SPEAKER_13]: always bought like from uprising seeds
here in Bellingham area and they grow only
[SPEAKER_13]: open pollinated seeds and I've been
growing those seeds for so many years I
[SPEAKER_13]: can't remember you know making the
umpteenth generations and you know it's
[SPEAKER_13]: it's something of significant value to me
because it it's it's embodied with almost
[SPEAKER_13]: not only within me and the food tastes
good to me but it's it does well with my
[SPEAKER_13]: environment and it's something that I can
pass on you know that maybe improve this
[SPEAKER_13]: just for this region and just for this
technique that's all that's enough you
[SPEAKER_13]: know or kept it alive and kept it around
go ahead josh I also agree that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: climatizing you know to an area so it's
not to say that you know it's you
[SPEAKER_04]: shouldn't grow someone else's seeds of
course you should because that's the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: entire point of making seeds you can say
hey the origins of this came from pacific
[SPEAKER_04]: northwest roots ross kaia paul you know or
nick or you know whoever it came from and
[SPEAKER_04]: then that's that's that's nice because
then you're being gracious and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: giving you know maybe it's kevin jodri you
know or whatever and then you can continue
[SPEAKER_04]: you know the right the representation of
where it came from but being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: climatize the sea like you said is really
powerful and it makes it you know even
[SPEAKER_04]: taste a little different for the zone and
that's that gives us own value i think
[SPEAKER_04]: kevin brings that up a lot you know you
know you got to find value and and value
[SPEAKER_04]: is not homogenization value is is
uniqueness um and and climatization brings
[SPEAKER_04]: on the uniqueness of of any given flavor
so yes we encourage anyone to always grow
[SPEAKER_04]: out the seeds um and and and and of course
you know like you know do something with
[SPEAKER_04]: them if you feel called to it you know
that's it that's a beautiful thing so sad
[SPEAKER_09]: that's why seed swaps are powerful and
that's part of us as human beings sifting
[SPEAKER_09]: through these seeds to create incredibly
beautiful varietals in the same way that a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of these scientists with this crisper
technology are trying to create something
[SPEAKER_09]: so our ability is community to breathe
through some really fire genetics that may
[SPEAKER_09]: have you know a lot of tendencies towards
powdery mildew or other leaf-feeding fungi
[SPEAKER_09]: you know if we continue to trade them and
we put them in different areas and regions
[SPEAKER_09]: then we're going to find an area in a
region and a farmer that grows it out
[SPEAKER_09]: really well to be able to keep that you
know varietal present because just like
[SPEAKER_09]: you were saying joshua you know like
nobody's talking about the tomato we need
[SPEAKER_09]: to talk about the plant as an entity too a
lot of us are talking about the
[SPEAKER_09]: manipulation of the plant and all of the
different varietals that we can create
[SPEAKER_09]: with the plant but we need to always pull
up a chair for the plant that the plant is
[SPEAKER_09]: is is what's important and moving forward
highlight all of her potentialities in the
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine that we ingest then all we're
doing is doing her a favor and we're true
[SPEAKER_09]: stewards of the plant and that's and
that's what we really need to be doing
[SPEAKER_09]: stewards of every single seed that we
create because that's creating that's
[SPEAKER_09]: that's completing the whole cycle of what
regeneration even means the other the
[SPEAKER_07]: other thing i wanted to add to the the
regenerative talk too was i learned more
[SPEAKER_07]: the first year and back in i was a 2018
was the first year of the region
[SPEAKER_07]: conference uh josh um i learned more at
that first meeting in portland than i did
[SPEAKER_07]: and probably the previous five to ten
years of going to other cannabis and
[SPEAKER_07]: agricultural conventions and listening to
talks it was just this wholly different
[SPEAKER_07]: level and people are hanging out at dinner
talking science talking you know all these
[SPEAKER_07]: different methodologies it's a completely
different kind of experience than any
[SPEAKER_07]: other kind of conference you're going to
go to and you'll learn more about more
[SPEAKER_07]: different things that you didn't know
exist that will help you have insight into
[SPEAKER_07]: why your plants are doing that weird thing
that you can't quite figure out or why
[SPEAKER_07]: you're you know x y and z and it certainly
will open a whole lot of new doors for you
[SPEAKER_07]: and help you figure out some stuff that
you you're struggling with before for sure
[SPEAKER_13]: i there's been a lot of folks that it's
that came to the first couple years that
[SPEAKER_13]: are now like in career you know
consultants running big bros when they
[SPEAKER_13]: first came in and not the connections and
the and the kind of lead off and the base
[SPEAKER_13]: really did lead does lead you know like i
think if i was going to advise someone
[SPEAKER_13]: that was 20 20 whatever trying to figure
out i want to be in the career i'd say hit
[SPEAKER_13]: the ganja hit all the regen conferences
try to figure out how to get them you're
[SPEAKER_13]: certified and fucking you know you'll have
all that you need right there to go figure
[SPEAKER_00]: it out you know hey i got a split guys my
uh my my human seed is demanding some
[SPEAKER_00]: attention so i want to say thanks marcus
for letting me be on your platform i
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you josh for inviting me on to
speak and it's like i said it's always an
[SPEAKER_00]: honor to hang out with all of you you're

really looking forward to those times and
[SPEAKER_09]: thanks again marcus you know you continue
to host these things it's just it's it's
[SPEAKER_09]: everything it's everything it truly is if
we're not sharing like this then it's all
[SPEAKER_09]: meaningless so it gives meaning to
everything that we do and i just
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciate you for continuously giving
meaning to everything that we do and
[SPEAKER_09]: everything that we are and joshua thinks
you know same thing and potent ponics
[SPEAKER_09]: tricks love you brian you know say hey to
the helios guys eric everything you you
[SPEAKER_09]: guys all in season you you all give
meaning to what it is that we all do and
[SPEAKER_09]: when we come and we talk about it it makes
us get get more energy for going out and
[SPEAKER_09]: doing and being better people being better
representations for this plant which is
[SPEAKER_09]: really what this is all about the more
that we can dress her up and put her into
[SPEAKER_09]: better circles with uh you know a more
refined uh voice and the more doors that
[SPEAKER_09]: we can push her through and and the more
conversations that people want to have
[SPEAKER_09]: about this plant and and want to ingest it
we just know that it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_09]: better world for humanity so i just
appreciate you guys to the inst of
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever that means so much love thanks
you guys thank you for coming on you will
[SPEAKER_13]: you will be big time missed uh the
conferences and should anything come up at
[SPEAKER_13]: the last minute you're welcome to come
crash our party please do you know i don't
[SPEAKER_13]: i we don't know anything could happen in
this world maybe we'll have a tunnel set
[SPEAKER_12]: up a projector and invite them on zoom
that's what someone suggested in the chat
[SPEAKER_12]: they should make an appearance yeah we can
definitely we can definitely try to do
[SPEAKER_13]: that at humble is is is impossible but
maybe we can do it at the other ones and
[SPEAKER_13]: try to get you guys in and if you're down
and we can make that happen that would be
[SPEAKER_13]: great actually i thought about that
earlier i was going to bring it up awesome
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome they haven't mandated um astral
travel yet so we still so we're still
[SPEAKER_09]: astral traveling almost every day so we
look forward to seeing you all in that
[SPEAKER_13]: space well thank you very much everybody
for tuning in and thanks to all the eric
[SPEAKER_13]: and steve and dragonfly and season and
brian and and you know i should have added
[SPEAKER_13]: to my list if you really want education in
the cannabis industry start uh episode one
[SPEAKER_13]: season one past church and um i have
learned a ton from watching these things
[SPEAKER_13]: i've learned a ton from the panelists it's
it is uh the highest classed show um in
[SPEAKER_13]: terms of education um and and that i've
you know been around in the industry hands
[SPEAKER_13]: down marcus you you've done an awesome
service to the world in this and uh really
[SPEAKER_13]: appreciate you giving space for the thing
that we do and and and uh really gracious
[SPEAKER_12]: man early thanks for the kind words
brother always happy to play my part it's
[SPEAKER_12]: great to listen today steve was helping me
in the background uh with some uh sort of
[SPEAKER_12]: zoom co-hosting thing so we're going to be
able to figure out maybe so hash church
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't have to change links when it goes
live it's going to help me figure that out
[SPEAKER_12]: so shout out to him for that and yeah
thank you guys for you know doing this
[SPEAKER_12]: today on here it was really really nice to
listen to everyone it was neat to hear a
[SPEAKER_12]: group of people who seemingly you know
have this great information and knowledge
[SPEAKER_12]: but even some of the things like when
kevin spoke and what he spoke about and
[SPEAKER_12]: how honest he was about how he's spoken
and then nicolas really kind of quite
[SPEAKER_12]: different it was uh it was nice to see
people not necessarily agreeing but
[SPEAKER_12]: sharing different points of perspective
without like getting on one another and
[SPEAKER_12]: just staying true to the topics i it was
really refreshing i appreciated it it's
[SPEAKER_13]: something that we we've we've strived for
and like because there is a lot of there
[SPEAKER_13]: can be a lot of little micro nitpicky
stuff within within subcultures and um you
[SPEAKER_13]: know even in our conference there's
there's there's conflict between k and f
[SPEAKER_13]: and soil food web and but we we really
just do a good job of talking it through
[SPEAKER_13]: and i think we'll kind of move past that
at this point but that was a thing uh
[SPEAKER_13]: there from you know it's things like that
and i you know i just really appreciate
[SPEAKER_13]: all the speakers even you know just just
willing to hold space with each other and
[SPEAKER_13]: learn from each other and um that's been a
you know one of the biggest blessings is
[SPEAKER_13]: being able to take everybody out to dinner
afterwards and just uh drink a beer and
[SPEAKER_13]: listen to people learn and from each other
you know and and discuss and there's
[SPEAKER_13]: there's contradictions and understanding
and it's it's been powerful how we how we
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of figure it out together you know um
i i know for sure every speaker has
[SPEAKER_13]: changed their vocabulary and their
understanding from those from those
[SPEAKER_12]: meetings and it's been really powerful so
awesome well if that's it thanks everybody
[SPEAKER_12]: and uh i guess i'll i'll stop the
recording and shut down youtube and uh
[SPEAKER_12]: houghton ponix hit me up you need to
finish off helping me uh not this minute
[SPEAKER_12]: by any means but eventually um thanks
everybody thanks josh i can't wait to uh
[SPEAKER_12]: you know hopefully become a part of
another regenerative uh conference here in
[SPEAKER_12]: in canada one day soon when this COVID-19
shit is done peace everybody nice to see
[SPEAKER_04]: tomatoes show up today have a great day
everyone love you peace brother you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah thanks again you
