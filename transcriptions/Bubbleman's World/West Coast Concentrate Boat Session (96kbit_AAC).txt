[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am sitting here with the West Coast
Concentrate crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to meet you guys finally,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey man, good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful day, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some young bubble ambassadors
living in the city of Vancouver these days
[SPEAKER_04]: and we've been trying to hook up through
sort of the Instagram, social media thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing you guys making some nice product
and I guess you guys watch church and are
[SPEAKER_04]: a part of the Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, they gave me a little gift here,
the West Coast Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me a little bit about this hash,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some, I believe it's purple candy,
full melt bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ran it probably two and a half,
three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some really nice frosty material,
fresh frozen, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, made from fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 73 micron of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got the 73 shirt on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, that's why we brought it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how perfect is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll take some pictures for you guys
so we give you the close up on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get my macro lens rocking on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the Dabinator is sitting
here on the boat as is the mothership.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful drop down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's time to do a little dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, shout out to Flav421 and Corey
Cottonum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flav had Corey make it as a gift and what
a kind, kind individual that Flav.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go, hitting the bobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low temp tabs, 511.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get to see Bowlman smoke your
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're down on a 500 temperature,
a carb cap like this is almost essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose half your hit if you don't have
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying you got like 13 hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like 420 or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling like I'm going to get a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like smoking a bubble joint or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the flavor on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's purple candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe it's candy kush cross purple
kush as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I taste the purple kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit more on the gassy side
for turps, would you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice for a midday fiesta on the lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to hit one of those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a dabber for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hold the carb cap for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, tell us a little bit about what's
going on with the West Coast Concentrate
[SPEAKER_04]: crew in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys up to these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically we're running all kinds of
solventless products now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do do hydrocarbon extraction as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically right now we're starting up
to do really good size production on the
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless level as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do bubble rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do sift rosin or key frozen as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually just got a brand new
press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start to flower rosin on
a bigger scale as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we get any flavors and everything
like that, we can start to run some really
[SPEAKER_01]: tasty stuff and get the real profile of it
instead of having to change it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that sounds great, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you guys are on the right
path.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn from the greatest and we
definitely, we can't take all the credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a really great team as well that's
helping us do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without them, you wouldn't have even
ever been able to see us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome to be able to share some
really nice hash with you and just come
[SPEAKER_01]: out and be on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, so nice out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been out on the boat for what has to
be about four or five, maybe six hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what time it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it came out at 10 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw the periscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's three 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So three, four, five, I've been out for
about five hours and I've only went to the
[SPEAKER_04]: dock really to grab you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been an absolute pleasure on the
water today.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water has just been so buttery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some bald eagles we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably just, just about 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the back of the head with the black
shirt, you're definitely feeling it on
[SPEAKER_04]: your shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a little sun tan today for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also almost, very little wind,
although even as I say that the water is
[SPEAKER_04]: moving a little bit, there's still very,
very little wind in the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful day to be puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably eight hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at 460 now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our D-nail is like, our D-nail,
our Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Dabinator is dropping in temp and we
are, our number of hits is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get that full flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you do that if you like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gassy.
Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: that camera doesn't auto focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but what I will do is I'll make a
point on photograph.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get some pictures of it in that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need the low tab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like space it out with the carb here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See 437.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got you guys introduced.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do some videos with these
guys in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see some fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe coming up in the next couple
of weeks, we'll maybe whip off a batch of
[SPEAKER_04]: hash or do some rosin or some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or all of the above maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be an honor for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got an Instagram they can check
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: At West Coast Melts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the West Coast Connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can follow the rest of the team at
West Coast Collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: No E on the end of Collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the West Coast Concentrate as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And True Genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget True Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Phil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have seen him on the channel
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my buddy from up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up moving out of town just a
little bit and is doing great things.
[SPEAKER_04]: He comes on to Hash Church every once in a
while and shares his personal information
[SPEAKER_04]: in regards to his cluster migraine
headaches that he suffers from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to Phil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks, everyone, for watching Bubble
Man's World.
