[SPEAKER_13]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're live.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: A mild conniption, a morning conniption is
never a bad thing on a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you might stub your toe on the
way to the shower or hash church might not
[SPEAKER_13]: work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck, fuck, shit, fuck.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pardon my French if there's children in
the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really don't like when it works,
but hey, we're live and I'm going to send
[SPEAKER_13]: out the links here right away to my
friends.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's see if we can't get that going.
[SPEAKER_13]: Apologies, everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: For my sketchy balledness here,
I'm operating on a few different
[SPEAKER_13]: computers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's see if we can make it work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see if it's going to go live.
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't go on live yet as far as I can
see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me reflip that up.
[SPEAKER_13]: The stream was definitely not stable.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: A bit of technical difficulties there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, we're going to definitely have
to keep our mics muted today when we're
[SPEAKER_13]: not talking because I don't have my
headphones, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Row lent me his computer, so I'm on a
nice computer that works.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this little piece of poo, I'm just
going to give that a toss that over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just joking.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we're back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just start right over.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to Hash Church episode 151.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here over at High Integrity Glass Art
today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're with the Sasquatch team.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, we're squashing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are still washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You going to show us that sexy glass?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sexy glass.
[SPEAKER_13]: What glass do I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're at High Integrity Glass,
I know you're in glass land.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's hitting it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come get that shit over here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Dosa banger hanger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, pertain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and vibrant, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that dichro work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful line work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dosa's just stacking them on top of one
another.
[SPEAKER_13]: How many layers of lines is that?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Double layers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Double layers, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: So sorry about that technical difficulties
and me mildly losing my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say to the Jesse,
the hippo pipe.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think that's kind of banger hanger
style.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit different, but definitely it
is a pipe, and it is glass, and you can
[SPEAKER_13]: smoke hash through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how are you guys doing here today?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sunday morning, we're going to press some
hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: This little M1 is awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Little unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what flavor are you squishing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yesterday we squished some What was
the MedMan cultivar?
[SPEAKER_11]: Headstache?
[SPEAKER_13]: Headstache, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: Squished pretty nice, but the one we
really liked, which was from Karma
[SPEAKER_13]: Genetics, and it was a biker hash,
or biker whatever, crossed with amnesia
[SPEAKER_13]: haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: Biker Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we called it here in BC,
it's been called biker Bob, it's been
[SPEAKER_13]: called a few different things.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, biker Kush crossed with amnesia
haze, and that thing spit out 29% return
[SPEAKER_13]: in a single press.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got 2.3 grams from 8 grams.
[SPEAKER_13]: What temp?
[SPEAKER_13]: What were we at, 200?
[SPEAKER_05]: 220.
[SPEAKER_13]: Were we up that high for the bike?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: 220.
[SPEAKER_13]: 220 degrees.
[SPEAKER_13]: I pressed it at 230, that sounds awesome
going down to 220.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, 230 is like you're – that's like
you're maybe dabbing at 800, 900 degrees.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just a little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to – I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you do, but you also love hot dabs,
800, 900 degree dabs.
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm not making fun of – But you just
sleep.
[SPEAKER_23]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_13]: You like hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he uses cannabis for pain relief,
and I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're using cannabis as pain relief,
and you're hitting super wasted to taste
[SPEAKER_13]: it, you're wasting it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not efficient to waste it to taste
the position that you want to leave.
[SPEAKER_13]: I puffed with him, and I've hit hot dabs
with Johnny B, and dude, I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_13]: we get ripped.
[SPEAKER_15]: He'll look over at me, he'll be like,
you want a hot dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: These low temp dabs, they're tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like in the morning when I'm
feeling pretty good, but as the day
[SPEAKER_03]: progresses, I like to turn the heat up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the 620.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I'm in a lot of pain, yeah,
710 and up for me, I've hit dabs at 900 by
[SPEAKER_03]: accident, and I'm like, dude, that just
rocked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends on the person and how
and what they're going to determine how
[SPEAKER_13]: they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone gets to do it differently.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on, Sub?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool story.
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't get to say hi to you the other
day, and you're driving.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like he's taking us to a field.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's like, let's go, bubble man,
I'm fucking taking you and your hash
[SPEAKER_15]: church crew.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll show you what Sub Cool does.
[SPEAKER_15]: Weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a big red Muppet right next to
him, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I love the Muppet.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_14]: Sub's in the house.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to come by and listen to squishy
talk.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my new hobby of smashing things.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got Matt right here from Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love my V2, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a slow start because there's about 8
million opinions on how to do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Last night, I actually cranked it up to
about 10 tons with low heat on my flowers.
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw it run for the first time.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had shit dripping down oil slick paper.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was very excited for somebody.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, look at this shit,
it's running down the paper.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: What temperature are you running,
Sub?
[SPEAKER_18]: 195 on my bottom plate, 200 on my top
plate.
[SPEAKER_18]: The mistake I was making, and I won't shut
up after I say this, but I was trying to
[SPEAKER_18]: warm it up and then press it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was trying to finesse it.
[SPEAKER_18]: What I learned last night was once you see
it bubble, smash the shit out of it and
[SPEAKER_18]: wait until it stops bubbling.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can correct me, but I was opening it
before it quit percolating.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was wasting shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, guess who else is here, Sub?
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_18]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's too much, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was talking about you.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know we just released Scarlet Queen
again, don't you, bad boy?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, it's such a long life.
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot it was in the book.
[SPEAKER_18]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_18]: We were down in the seed room,
and I was like, didn't we?
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't some friends of mine make this one
time?
[SPEAKER_18]: I opened up the book, and there it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he was just mentioning it before we
went live.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, yeah, I saw Sub releasing some
of the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, wicked, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, people want it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go get it out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, go pack some bags and press some
goddamn bubbles, for god's sakes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Smash some shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to talk a little bit about,
because I have some Keith, some really
[SPEAKER_18]: nice wedding cake, Keith, that a friend of
mine gave me.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's white.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't really love the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I still have it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he pressed some once when he was at
the house and got a good result.
[SPEAKER_18]: So my next venture into this game is going
to be smashing some Keith, some hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, do we lower the temperature?
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we lower the pressure?
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we kind of talk about how that works?
[SPEAKER_13]: You can even go a little bit warmer with
hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're getting up to 200, 220 degrees for
hash, sift, and bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does depend on the melt factor for
sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's always a sweet spot in all
of these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I like to tell everyone, when they're
asking me my opinion, like I'm an expert
[SPEAKER_13]: or something, and I just say, you know,
it's like whether you're making water hash
[SPEAKER_13]: or dry sift or rosin, there's a sweet spot
where you're going to get the majority of
[SPEAKER_13]: your yield with all of your flavor.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you don't, you know, when people are
[SPEAKER_11]: getting too long, you just don't want to
lose any.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to find a sweet spot,
like get most of your yields just in one
[SPEAKER_11]: shot.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're pressing right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of bubble hash there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like really sifty.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is very sifty.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost a fluffy bubble compared to
that 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a mixed bag or is that one
particular flavor?
[SPEAKER_14]: One flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a green crack God.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you listen to this one on the
table, the other one just sounds like a
[SPEAKER_13]: bag going down, but this one's like,
this one has some, some beef cake to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's definitely like feels self-pressed
and I think it's going to squish really
[SPEAKER_13]: nice, but I want to film that on the 4k
camera, but we'll, we'll maybe film a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit with, with what, what tempo you
squished that at or attempt to squish it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably 200.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's, I'm, I'm letting the
Sasquatch crew do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's their machine.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's their sort of level of expertise.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're following their numbers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's working great.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's always going to be people who say
they do 160, 150, 170, 180.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it all depends on what you're,
you're hitting to and what your level and
[SPEAKER_13]: your bar is of what you're anticipating to
get as an end result.
[SPEAKER_13]: And trust me, when we squish the stuff
that we squish, it is so terpy.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is so tasty and it's very, very strong,
you know, 80% THC easy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I learned, I learned last night that even
like even folding the collector can be an
[SPEAKER_18]: art form and can either assist your squish
or buck your squish up the way you,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, the way you direct the hash,
where you, some guy was squishing expert
[SPEAKER_18]: joint roller was mashing little pieces of
old hash last night, just little pieces.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you could see where he put it on the
press made a difference.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you put it too far back, it can cause a
problem if you put it too far forward.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just, I'm amazed by the pressing a
hash, but I want to tell a quick story.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been dying to tell to this and I'm
not, I want to start a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_18]: shit storm with you guys, but Frenchy came
out a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I make the joke that Frenchy is one of the
few men on the earth that I'll allow kiss
[SPEAKER_18]: me on the mouth.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not a gay thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, Frenchy gets you on the mouth
and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_18]: So Frenchy came over and brought some
really nice hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was low on hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: The hash makers here in my area are all
busy as shit making juice or whatever the
[SPEAKER_18]: shit they make nowadays.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Frenchy came over and he brought me
three containers, some black, really nice
[SPEAKER_18]: hash, some master Yoda and a little
container wrapped up that he said,
[SPEAKER_18]: this is my best goo.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is two years old.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is, this is brist.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's black African gunji looking
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you guys know I love bubble,
white bubble, clear bubble, the stuff that
[SPEAKER_18]: basically Mark taught me to make 20 damn
years ago that I've been making in his
[SPEAKER_18]: bags forever.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we enjoyed the time with Frenchy and I
smoked Frenchy's hash, especially the
[SPEAKER_18]: special hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: I get really fucking trashed.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can talk about the high of it later,
but the point of this story and shorten it
[SPEAKER_18]: up is I told you I was a little low on
hash and Frenchy left my house with a
[SPEAKER_18]: bunch of containers and I still felt like
I was low on hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a personal choice for me,
but I don't understand why I like the
[SPEAKER_18]: white fresh stuff so much better than what
someone takes it and rolls it around and
[SPEAKER_18]: smashes the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted your take on this Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't think it's a shit storm.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think you're going to find it an
interesting take because my take these
[SPEAKER_13]: days, you know, I saw recently here in
Vancouver, we had a big debate and it was
[SPEAKER_13]: with Dana Larson and Dan Sutton.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dana Larson owns dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan Sutton owns labs.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Dana was saying dispensaries are the
best.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan was saying, you know, lab tested LPs
are the best.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's kind of like where I'm coming
from now is that the more options we have,
[SPEAKER_13]: the better is the best.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no best because it's a quiver.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have all of these different options and
why would we then, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, when I first came out,
it was like I was very staunch and it had
[SPEAKER_13]: to be this and this and this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now I'm like, hey, whatever you want
to do, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't fight against oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't fight against access, you know,
the same way dispensary LP world of
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do we debate about which one is best
when clearly they both are necessary gap
[SPEAKER_13]: that needs to be filled.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so Frenchies hash fills a gap.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your fresh, beautiful white bubble that
you make fills a gap.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, shitty hardcore pressed bunk
third world import swag fucking
[SPEAKER_13]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even know how bad another bad word
to call it, but that's another person.
[SPEAKER_13]: They like rolling a big tobacco spliff
right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like they love it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think that what you love is
what you love and you should have access
[SPEAKER_13]: to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for you, you know, listen, the funniest
story ever was when Cuban told me he met
[SPEAKER_13]: Frenchie, this Frenchie guy, my dry sift
and, yo, man, he's like finger fucking it
[SPEAKER_13]: on my hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, you know, when you were
giving him your hash, he was going to
[SPEAKER_13]: press that shit up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, here's another one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one thing I don't like about
pressed hash versus the unpressed dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it has less surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, when you put it into the
mold, it doesn't bust or vape or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has less surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put in dry sift and you're using
like a flame, then you instantly are
[SPEAKER_00]: coating all of the resin heads with the
flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what I'm talking about,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking about especially the way to
press up the hash like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You end up with more of a smolder than
this blasting combustion that you can get
[SPEAKER_13]: with the full melt bubble or dry sift when
it has that surface area.
[SPEAKER_13]: You blast it and it's just like,
whew.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I find the same thing with white
bubble.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the white bubble dust,
it burns differently in a bowl than the
[SPEAKER_18]: stuff that crunches up on the side.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, when you carry it in your pocket
or something for a while, it also does the
[SPEAKER_18]: smoldering you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course it melts, but it's a different
feel in your mouth and on your tongue and
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you, Marcus, different smokes
for different folks, whatever people like
[SPEAKER_00]: the best is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have my preferences and I think
you and I are pretty much in agreement on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make resin present the finest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what you're talking about is
there's a sense to be a degradation of the
[SPEAKER_02]: product that he has.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate his stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely old school hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way that he takes it and he
processes it and squishes it the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: he does, it somehow also removes a lot of
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and so a lot of the flavonoids and
etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: are destroyed somewhere along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you had something that was two
years old, I mean, you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: on top of that, oxygenation and
degradation just in the containers as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as, you know, there isn't, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you store buds for two years in a
cardboard box in a cool, dark room,
[SPEAKER_00]: after two years, most of the turps are
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the THC is still there and most of
it's still THCA also.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why freshly cured buds smush
better.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry I cut you off.
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that, that's why like for me,
we've been smushing buds that are dry,
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe a week, two weeks in the jar,
dry, but I wouldn't call them cured.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, definitely smokable, delicious,
all that.
[SPEAKER_18]: But if I was going to call it cured,
they'd have to stay in the jar a few more
[SPEAKER_18]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see how much CBN is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, if it were tested,
because I guarantee you there's got to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a high level of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: After two years, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say after two years, no, Sam?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was little, very little CBN,
surprisingly little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we tested it fresh, there was
none.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to press some of his master Yoda
today, because again, I didn't,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_18]: It smolders too much.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little blondie in color.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was going to put some in a small bag
and try pressing it this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll take some pictures.
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be interesting to see,
you know, what kind of yield I get out of
[SPEAKER_18]: this hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause it was trichomes at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Swish away Montferrat and let us know when
actually transpires.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see what actually comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pressing flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What humidity?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, looking at the humidity levels for
pressing flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I think it plays a key factor
in your rosin.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I pressed some black cherry soda I
had.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a strain we breed with.
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't necessarily love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's red, maroon, purple, and it smashes
this ready resin out.
[SPEAKER_18]: We did some about a week ago that was
fairly fresh and the rosin had a nice
[SPEAKER_18]: color to it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I did some last night after
leaving the jar open a week and letting it
[SPEAKER_18]: dry more and the yield went down.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just learning this stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: The yield went down and it's darker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is darker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find the stuff that's fresher when I
come off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys see it in my pictures and as
things progress, I'm caring for a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked all different humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause of course I'm pressing all my own
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking all those resin chips that I've
been saving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try and process that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's got to be, we already know
there's at least 10% left in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but yeah, the humidity for me plays a
big difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw with the lower humidity,
less yield to the between 62 to 65.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a better yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably means the rosin you're
pressing from the damper buds also has a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher moisture content.
[SPEAKER_14]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I would just say that humidity plays
an important part for everyone because
[SPEAKER_13]: humidity is exactly how this process
works.
[SPEAKER_13]: Without moisture, this process does not
work.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a steam distillation process where
you steam the moisture out of the bud and
[SPEAKER_13]: it carries the oil out with the pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: So humidity is basically the most
important thing when it comes to pressing
[SPEAKER_13]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_18]: What is the benefit of whipping it?
[SPEAKER_18]: Last time.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've just been, okay, back up.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll talk real quick.
[SPEAKER_18]: So when I started, I couldn't make more
than I could smoke in a few hours.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then as I got better, I could make
enough to maybe last the day.
[SPEAKER_18]: And now I actually have a store of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've been pressing it, putting it oil
slicks, putting it in the refrigerator,
[SPEAKER_18]: but I noticed people with it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I whipped some last night.
[SPEAKER_18]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Just looks?
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it do anything to it?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that all of the textures are for
people to have it be the texture they
[SPEAKER_13]: like, maybe to make it easier to pick up
with a dabber or to dab or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when you're changing the texture of
change, the quality of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's, you can't make your resin better
because you whip it or because you,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, maybe you're whipping it and
adding turps so you can fit it into a pen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you're, you know, keeping it up to a
hotter temperature so you get it more
[SPEAKER_13]: tacky.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and you know, a lot of times when you
go lower, you end up with this cake
[SPEAKER_13]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you whip it real good, it is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, when I whip my ice cream up,
it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I did it last night and you know,
the new thing is the whipping it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's, it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_18]: I, I can't believe.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you guys that know me for a while,
like when I found Mark's bubble bags,
[SPEAKER_18]: I left the planet.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I, I was in my kitchen with a fucking
steel spoon and a bag of ice for two
[SPEAKER_18]: years.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, for real.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then hash makers came along and I got
my life back and then I developed again.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I got a damn Sasquatch resin press in
my basement.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have more rosin than I need and I want
to go home and play with the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our toys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We getting ready to do another press over
there or what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's check out and show you guys this
little thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fucking pimp.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a, this is one of their,
I guess, latest models, would you not say?
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting the freeze.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to definitely say check
out your communities when you're pressing
[SPEAKER_03]: that rosin and the flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely plays a key role.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I really realized that
for me is when I was just being lazy and I
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted the bud that was sitting in the
room because it wasn't cured yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like looking at my humidium at
72%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I grabbed some buds went inside
and squished it and I was like,
[SPEAKER_20]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then no more contaminants in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not pulling out all the little pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when it's dryer, when we squish it,
you get all the contaminants, what we used
[SPEAKER_03]: to do in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're definitely advancing.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's going to tell a little.
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's my muscle story.
[SPEAKER_18]: So not that I have any.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I, uh, this, I got the whole kit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got the compressor, the foot pedal,
and I got a jack.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've been using the jack to learn
because of finessing, turn the compressor
[SPEAKER_18]: on once you sit.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, all right, well that's
fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_18]: That thing goes 10,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I didn't understand why you would
really need that until the other day.
[SPEAKER_18]: I spent about three hours in the basement
with the car jack pressing.
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course that night I was like,
what is wrong with my shoulders?
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you press a car jack for about two
and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll wear you out.
[SPEAKER_18]: So obviously long-term, you know,
pressing bag after bag after bag,
[SPEAKER_18]: you get your numbers down, you know,
your, your, your heat and your pressure.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, then you can use that foot pedal and
that compressor to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, I do think you can finesse with it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Once you know your numbers, the whole
thing trial and error.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we got the Sasquatch guys here.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we're pressing it up today.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: We pressed it up yesterday and we're going
to press it up today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, hopefully all my Sasquatches,
the V1, the V2 and the M1 are going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: going into full rosin production.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, why not?
[SPEAKER_13]: Just let's get some rosin made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like people have some pressing
issues.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's pressing issues for certain.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder where the rest of the crew is
today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tony said he was going to come in and drop
some knowledge today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Natasha said she was going to be
in around nine 30.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think she said she was going to also be
inviting Selena.
[SPEAKER_08]: Selena was willing to come in and have a
visit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, I think I need a bong
rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's D420K?
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder, did he not get the link or
something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bong rip in his absence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've done this little, Meti Kush first
bounce and that took a little bit of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Crystal has been put into a powder on
top of this for a morning little bong rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess, uh, we'll wait for,
oh, there is no pipe here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is service.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nathan Morrison being at the head shop and
not having a bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the Abbotsford air show happening
out here in Abbotsford, this beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: town of mine today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in about 20 minutes, we're going to
start hearing fighter jets flying over me
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I might have to sign off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get really loud out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we'll take that into account.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you got going on here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Strawberry Nana.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love that shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's a good cultivar when,
when it tastes so good and you didn't hit
[SPEAKER_13]: it, you're like, you hit it three rips ago
and you're hitting different shit through
[SPEAKER_13]: your pipe and you're like, oh,
that smell, it tastes like the strawberry
[SPEAKER_13]: banana.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, no, dude, that was the such and
such in the pipe.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, a place to hang the banger.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just hang it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are you heading?
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going up to the, to the garden.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll probably lose signal a little while
you see my 14 foot monsters.
[SPEAKER_18]: Look, last night we figured out I don't
have enough room to cure and draw plants
[SPEAKER_18]: bigger.
All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's tripping out because I didn't
bring a hat.
[SPEAKER_13]: I woke up at six in the morning and split
to catch a ferry to get over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't have a hat.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is what I look like without a hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question for you guys over
there at high integrity glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you prefer just your standard bangers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do like the, the new thermal
bangers?
[SPEAKER_03]: No,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen, uh, I think Pukin Beagles got
one and others are making them now,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are double walled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I haven't tried one yet, but I've
heard people say, that those tend to have
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more flavor than the standard,
uh, quave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just tried one the other day at a
cannabis culture and I was pretty like
[SPEAKER_03]: tripped out about it at first and there's
heat in the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can Ro answer?
[SPEAKER_16]: I just picked mine up and, uh,
I haven't got to try it yet, but they look
[SPEAKER_16]: like they worked, uh, amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're hard to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is yours from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whose is it made by Ro?
[SPEAKER_13]: Pukin Beagles.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just ordered one.
[SPEAKER_13]: One from Harmony, Whitney Harmony,
the one with the colored glass in the
[SPEAKER_13]: bottom of it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, they seem to be hard to come
by because it seems a lot of the hardcore
[SPEAKER_02]: heads are definitely snatching them up
because of her.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is exceptional flavor, but it's going
to say the flavor was amazing when I hit
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was pretty cool.
That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_23]: Delicious on that strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_14]: You ever get any of that strawberry
banana?
[SPEAKER_14]: In Amsterdam, Sam?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it, but it's probably here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably so good that nobody showed
it to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just crazy to think that that cultivar
isn't in Amsterdam where DNA like was
[SPEAKER_13]: like, you know, housed for the last,
what, 12 years, 13 years now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that how long they've been in Amsterdam
for?
[SPEAKER_13]: 13 years?
[SPEAKER_13]: For 2004, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure of the first year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think it was 2004.
[SPEAKER_13]: They showed up with the white lab coats.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw them at the milk bag.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, who are these guys?
[SPEAKER_13]: They had the melty hash, the mean Martian,
green Martian or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get along with these guys
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I always liked it was everybody
thought it was DNA seeds, but it was Don
[SPEAKER_00]: and Aaron seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys killing it out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Amsterdam started getting weird.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, Amsterdam's kind of a trippy
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: For smoking, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be involved in commerce,
it's a fine line to walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't supply wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, yeah, you could have a coffee
shop, but there's only however many of
[SPEAKER_00]: those there are in the country,
and they're constantly trying to thin them
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Greetings from the Netherlands,
Hugo.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you in the chat there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not hear back from Toro.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got a call from Wendy, and then I
called her back and left messages.
[SPEAKER_13]: Never heard back from her, but Toro also
has a really cool reactor core banger that
[SPEAKER_13]: they've got.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's got a little chunk of quartz
right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_13]: Works a little bit different from the
thermal, but even that little chunk of
[SPEAKER_13]: quartz is warmer and holding and retaining
heat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially when you put a big dab down on
the quartz, you're obviously cooling the
[SPEAKER_13]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what is the best temperature to drop
the dab, depending on the size of the dab
[SPEAKER_13]: and the surface area of the quartz?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that ratio is a very important
ratio when you're looking for that sweet,
[SPEAKER_13]: sweet, perfect hit every time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody really showed up today.
[SPEAKER_13]: The panel, I think, at this point is like
10, 1030.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're good to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what we should start doing is when
we have slow hash churches, just stop at
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 o'clock, and then I'll get all these
messages from Tony and people being like,
[SPEAKER_13]: what happened?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's hash church?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, oh, we're already done,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell them it was our best ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the best ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were fireworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were fireworks and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had strippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireworks?
[SPEAKER_13]: The restaurant emptied out as we were
sitting there eating, and it got later and
[SPEAKER_13]: later.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we looked to the city.
[SPEAKER_13]: The restaurant was completely empty.
[SPEAKER_13]: We looked to Vancouver, and all of a
sudden these beautiful fireworks start
[SPEAKER_13]: going off like it's for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big, huge explosions.
[SPEAKER_13]: My wife's like, the fireworks are over
because we have all these different
[SPEAKER_13]: countries represented in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a barge of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fireworks got set off every third night or
something for a week or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a big competition.
[SPEAKER_13]: Team Japan won this year, for instance,
but this wasn't that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We asked one of the waiters, and he was
just like, it could be one of the four
[SPEAKER_13]: huge movies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny Depp's filming a movie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan Reynolds is filming Deadpool 2.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Rock is filming some movie about
skyscrapers.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it was one of the movies setting
off all these fireworks, but what a
[SPEAKER_13]: fucking sweet bonus at the end of our
Salmon House on the Hill meal last night
[SPEAKER_13]: to have 200 grand worth of fireworks go
off.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's wicked.
[SPEAKER_13]: 500 viewer rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I'll do a 500 viewer rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bingo bong.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bong rip for 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salmon House on the Hill, is that where we
went, Nate?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we definitely went to the Salmon
House on the Hill, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it is really, really good food.
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_13]: What did we have?
[SPEAKER_13]: We had the Arctic Sablefish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what it was?
[SPEAKER_09]: What was this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sablefish.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_13]: So good.
[SPEAKER_13]: How is Concentrated X Products?
[SPEAKER_13]: His stuff looks so fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: Concentrated X Products are so fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some strawberry banana here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a little of the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I have them all right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I ran away because I just
brought up my sift that I was in the
[SPEAKER_03]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I set it down on the thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half an hour later, I went to do another
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just turning into goo, so I ran to
put it back in the fridge.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, get her back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get her in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is all out of the fridge,
but that's okay because it's rosin and
[SPEAKER_13]: it's Oatay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_13]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_13]: We should have a Skunkman Sam movie.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, do you have the movie rights yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go watch the movie instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go watch the movie in the theaters
instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just be like, I don't want to be in the
movie.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just go watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need a good actor like Brad Pitt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he puffs.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he's good to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a couple of key events in your life
to do in a movie.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that your movie would be pretty
legit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, stop animation with the Dr. Seustal.
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll be his movie.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll just be that Dr. Seustal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what will it be named?
[SPEAKER_02]: By a skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: By any other name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smellas?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if there's smoke, there's fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have named it, I patented that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did patent it for smoke, there's fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be 220, and the smaller amount
produced more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you weigh it?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is like a gram, and this is
probably like three grams.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Hustle King, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Subsplit before I got to say hi for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did have it on the back of my mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't forgetting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apologies for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just take a hot dab?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you just take a Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_13]: I just did a hot dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: I might have to hit the turpsugars here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got the turpsugars here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hit this?
[SPEAKER_23]: No, you eat it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put it in water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stir it into some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have definitely stirred it into
water, but I also, well, that's how I
[SPEAKER_13]: showed you when you first did it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I put a little in of water, and then I
added a little bit of the turp syrups,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's also nice to just take a little
mouthful of Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's wicked, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to try this Jack Frost actually in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: That turp stuff, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to try it at Tony's lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very strange sensation to have
something granular dissipate, but yet have
[SPEAKER_02]: the full flavor of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very strange sensation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and no cannabinoids there or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of expected to pop rock though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those should be made into pop rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for the pop rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit it right on the head when I ate
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, where's the pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called pot rocks, and they're a
chunky version.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're tasty.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you have some?
[SPEAKER_13]: Explosions of turps in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just so nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Never got a link from Tony.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Minnesota Dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, he's going to hook up with you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was talking to me about you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're definitely talking about you,
bro, with your purple and blue,
[SPEAKER_13]: red, and heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know what's up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've linked with two people recently,
and you're one of the pharmacy bros.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to link up with those guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: They seem like they know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're excited so far.
[SPEAKER_13]: We never like to jump the gun.
[SPEAKER_13]: We always like to do the testing first,
but once the pesticide testing is free and
[SPEAKER_13]: clear, that's when we can really develop a
relationship.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're like, we have a prenup.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't sign the prenup, we can't get
into a relationship together.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Xylitol toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did that pen come out yet?
[SPEAKER_13]: That pen is coming out very soon,
bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very, very soon.
[SPEAKER_13]: I still can't believe what a small little
group we have in here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like I have forgotten to send the
link to a bunch of people or something,
[SPEAKER_13]: but now I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they got the link, and they'll
have to come in when they want to come in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you guys pressing over there?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because we're pressing the lowest
quality, because we're saving the highest
[SPEAKER_13]: quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is this, the mix?
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you end up mixing them, bro?
[SPEAKER_13]: Try the 45.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always oilier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which strain are they squishing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the green crack, God.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, it's like the stuff they want to
squish, the stuff that's going to return
[SPEAKER_13]: and be beautiful and be exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, please don't squish that right
away, because I want to film it,
[SPEAKER_13]: and I still want to run and operate Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it'll be better for us to film
with the 4K camera and do a nice little
[SPEAKER_13]: video, so I guarantee us grams of oil in
that bag of hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to have solventless mine done.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't connect with them, and I think
Natasha and Selena are coming on,
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really talked to Natasha,
but I think, well, she said she was coming
[SPEAKER_13]: on at 9.30 or so, so I think we'll see her
in the next little bit, but we'll have to
[SPEAKER_13]: see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes things happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: My God, his IG is awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whose IG is awesome?
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to go check out an awesome IG.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to look at an awesome IG,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where have you been, my friend,
Dr. Mock?
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you been fishing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was in a fishing hole for a couple
weeks, sorry.
Really?
[SPEAKER_13]: Fish in a barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just surface and fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a Baker's Dozen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm wearing my Baker's Dozen shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did 13 nights with no repeats,
and at the end, they had a banner hoisted
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass at Square Garden memorizing or
memorializing this 13 nights.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw one of the friends of family or
whatever took a picture of the band on the
[SPEAKER_13]: stage, the classic Cypress Hill does it
all the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of bands do it, but Fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Dan Clinch who does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's noted for that photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: The band with the audience in the
background, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: This wasn't taken by him.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually taken by a chick.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's a friend of the band.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an awesome picture because she took
it in a way.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I saw it, I thought, this is so Fish.
[SPEAKER_13]: She took it in a way so you couldn't
really see the audience.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just Fish standing on the stage.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can kind of see a bit in the
background, but generally, it'll be taken
[SPEAKER_13]: by a professional photographer who will go
up on a fucking ladder, shoot down in a
[SPEAKER_13]: way that gets the band, but with the whole
audience because you want to show off and
[SPEAKER_13]: flex how powerful you are.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking, what an amazing picture.
[SPEAKER_13]: Madison Square Garden and you can't even
see the audience.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just Fish standing there with their
little leg.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each night was a different donut,
so there was a different theme to every
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the Boston Flame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and everyone thought that for the
lemon poppy donut, they'd play Led
[SPEAKER_01]: Zeppelin's Lemon Song.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the obvious, squeeze my lemon till
the juice runs down your leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They played some obscure Radiohead song
that I guess mentions lemon in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they also written by Blind Lemon
Jefferson, so an old blues song.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really creative how they used each
night's flavor of donut to dig into a
[SPEAKER_01]: repertoire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on, Tony?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in your car, you're cruising,
you're driving, you're hustling.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm not driving, my man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got count of concentrates driving.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, he just said something to me in the
room.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was like, dude, did you see my question
or something?
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not see your question.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no, I sent the link to, I just sent
a link to Minnesota Dabs.
[SPEAKER_19]: We are, I was heading to, I was actually
heading to the Barberry Coast Lounge to do
[SPEAKER_19]: a little barrage.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty cool vibe.
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a dispensary then attached to it
as a giant like a dab bar.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there's like 10 different rigs
and like a solventless rig only.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they have a whole nother room for
like tables with plugs in the middle of
[SPEAKER_19]: them.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can just kind of show up and puff
or bring your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I thought it was a cool, cool place to
go hang out.
[SPEAKER_19]: So sorry about being a little late.
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard all the comments though about
starting later.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you and Mark showed up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, damn, it's like, it's a quiet
church.
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, I got 12 minutes into church
today and I had to close it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is church two right now we're on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mark's like, if no one's here at 9 15,
it's over like school.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like if the teacher doesn't show up at 9
15, everyone's dismissed.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just split.
[SPEAKER_13]: I tell the whole class, just go all of
you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to get this guy on because
it'll be an interesting topic for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause he is the guy that has been
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's the only guy that cultivates and also
washes his own resin and it comes out like
[SPEAKER_19]: a plum blue.
[SPEAKER_19]: And at first you think, okay, maybe the
resin has like anthocyanin that's kind of
[SPEAKER_19]: staining the resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: But potentially it's, that's why I wanted
to kind of have him come in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause it'd be interesting to hear Mark's
theory and Skunkman's theory because the
[SPEAKER_19]: only thing blue that I know is Azulene,
which is a blue colored terpene.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we had this conversation before
over terpenes in the way they express
[SPEAKER_19]: color.
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's definitely, there's definitely
a blue terpene out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has he analyzed it Tony?
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I sent him a link.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's probably trying to, I sent it to him
on a go straight left, left, left.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go straight there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were almost like going the wrong
direction.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you do that in California, you're done
for like hours.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I talk to you all the time on the
phone and you're like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_15]: oh shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Take it right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_19]: But he's probably trying to figure out
the, he's probably trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_19]: the link.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause the first time you get that link,
you're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a hangout.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you got to download the hangout.
[SPEAKER_13]: He says he's trying to get in now.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's in the YouTube chat, Minnesota dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, I'm trying to get in now.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, have you gotten one of these yet?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm still waiting.
[SPEAKER_13]: They went to deliver them and it was to
the PO box.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have to get it on Monday.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we're here pressing Ross and
dude, we're going to get ready.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the one thing I would say when you
get it though.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I know there's a lot of people like
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Back into the website.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when they release, this is not like a
normal tank where they'll thing,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, prolong the longevity and allow you to
keep reusing and reusing the tank.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but you know, I, I actually spent the
last, uh, week or two weeks just,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, you know, playing like the average
public would, where I loaded the tank and
[SPEAKER_19]: then load the tank again and try to load
it again for the third time without
[SPEAKER_19]: cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I've done it cleaning it,
uh, you know, dropping it in an ice oh,
[SPEAKER_19]: and then drop it in water.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and then I've done it like short and
then I've done it long.
[SPEAKER_19]: I boiled like semi-boiled it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I try to do all kinds of things just
to, uh, mess around with it to see like
[SPEAKER_19]: the best use of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But ultimately I'm going to get a t-shirt
that says pull, press and pull.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Press and pull, press and pull because,
uh, and it's hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really hard to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not like you get reprimanded too
bad because, uh, you can still continue
[SPEAKER_19]: forward.
[SPEAKER_19]: But what I mean by that is this is a
different kind of, uh, when you're
[SPEAKER_19]: putting, when you're making different
kinds of rosin and rosin sauces.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you look like in here, there's a
hole all the way through it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if you could see it because
I'm in the car.
[SPEAKER_19]: See if I can get this.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: See the hole.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a little different than other
tanks.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's four, four holes in here that
bring in the oil to the element.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, the elements kind of like got a lot of
little, uh, it's like a pumice stone
[SPEAKER_19]: almost, if you will.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that kind of concept that's in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so you have to pull, then press,
then pull.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when you pull that, you get zero,
zero on the battery, zero discharge out of
[SPEAKER_19]: the card.
[SPEAKER_19]: But even if you don't remember to do that,
cause you hit it hard, like Preston and I
[SPEAKER_19]: yesterday, you just take a little Q-tip to
the, to the end of the battery and you
[SPEAKER_19]: move on.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not even, it's not a big deal,
but there's little things like this that
[SPEAKER_19]: have to be explored.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when people get them, they understand
how to use them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause everybody, they hit the button first
that I've given it to and wait as if
[SPEAKER_19]: they're like trying to warm up the oil and
then hit it, which would be normal for a
[SPEAKER_19]: coil type of pen or it would be normal for
other kinds of like, uh, pens that you
[SPEAKER_19]: might've got for Omicron.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were like, Oh, I need to warm up the
oil first.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not how this works.
[SPEAKER_19]: The oil is always in the, the element and
you just, you pull, then you press.
[SPEAKER_19]: So let me show you, you can pull,
press, and then, and you get 12 seconds.
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't seen anyone go three times,
but I'll try it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the original Omicron that you
always, you had to hit it kind of heated
[SPEAKER_02]: up for a second so that the, the mechanism
heated up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I look forward to trying one,
Tony, so that, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, get used to the new type of mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I did Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: What flavor are you hitting?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why everyone forgets the Paul
because after you're hit, you're like,
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so good.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you forget the Paul, but just
pull some cool air through it because
[SPEAKER_19]: it'll bring the oil back into the element.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got one for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got your, uh, I probably could come.
[SPEAKER_02]: What flavor are you hitting currently?
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the lemon remedy three to one CBD.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, this is an Afghan blueberry that,
that happens to be, this is the one that
[SPEAKER_19]: we won with the Emerald cup with.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long has that lasted you so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many hits you are you getting out of a
cartridge filling?
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I don't know, but the battery lasted
the whole tank, so I'm not having to fill.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not having to recharge this,
this battery.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was part of the design.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would say that, uh, I mean,
how many hits?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, does it have a five battery,
uh, five press on and off so that the
[SPEAKER_02]: button doesn't trigger?
[SPEAKER_19]: No.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so it has an auto.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we built these with auto shut off.
[SPEAKER_19]: So after two minutes, it automatically
shuts off.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you put it in your pocket,
it won't go off.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have times to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, uh, so many people have like
wanted to, oh, does it have temperature
[SPEAKER_19]: control?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, and I kind of like Preston got
his yesterday.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, when you, it's just a different
setup.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a 14 watt sub home battery that
works on a five, 10, um, red, but the
[SPEAKER_19]: battery is powerful enough that you could
do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like you don't really need to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You just go, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_19]: You just go like this,
[SPEAKER_19]: but you still get a great low time dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you wanted to rip it, you could rip
this three times.
[SPEAKER_15]: They can dabs while on the go medicine on
the go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been waiting for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carrying a torch and a banger and a glass
with me every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got really small and I have micro
rigs, but I'd rather have something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: more on the go that was more properly
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm taking it to a level that,
you know, cause the most depends that I
[SPEAKER_02]: know are cheap and are, I mean,
they're improving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, over the design and the current
design is better, but I'm still not a fan
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one I could see becoming a fan of.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: What they do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, Tony.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I was going to say what everybody else
is doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just slapping their name on certain
parts.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you mean when Gary came on past
church before bubble man, if I sat around
[SPEAKER_19]: many times, I was making this like very
rich terpene oil with rosin and,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, and basically, uh, didn't have a place
for it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause we couldn't put it in a,
like we put it in a vial and then you saw
[SPEAKER_19]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had those little droppers before,
and that doesn't really make best use of a
[SPEAKER_19]: high grade oil like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's something that's like,
it's just, you don't get every last drop
[SPEAKER_19]: out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, you know, we kind of sat around
like, man, it'd be nice to have,
[SPEAKER_19]: and this won't be the first one.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, just, you know, obviously we've
got other, uh, hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: See what happened here.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: Speaker phone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you could turn it off.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're still there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're listening.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're, we're, uh, we're attentive.
[SPEAKER_13]: These guys are pressing over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking for another bong rip soon.
[SPEAKER_13]: Might have to request D420k.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you buddy?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_19]: Shit just drippy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, see how like viscous this oil is.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there was like really no, there's like
really no other thing to put this in,
[SPEAKER_19]: but we sat around.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember Marcus was like, oh yeah,
I wish I could have a mobile dab,
[SPEAKER_19]: something that like low maintenance and
didn't have to clean it, but it delivered.
[SPEAKER_19]: The taste.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, what do you think about them?
[SPEAKER_12]: They work great.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even when I'm pressing, it's a little,
uh, we just put rosin in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Preston.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it works pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: What'd you think of the taste among other
things is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the, the flavor comes through unreal,
just like a low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even when you try to blast it for two or
three.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe I don't have them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's why I didn't want to like
show it off too much.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chalice chugger.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I mean, so that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you go really light with it,
or if you just go three pulls on it,
[SPEAKER_19]: um, I mean, you can get a tearjerker,
but the taste isn't going to change all
[SPEAKER_19]: the way through the tank.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would say there's, I mean,
look at the rip on that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you say tearjerker?
[SPEAKER_12]: It can't be.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can easily overdo it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could actually, it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just like, I call it the Preston
Sean 8033.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was his joke.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to check it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm rolling into, uh, I'm rolling into my
facility real quick to get a couple,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, ball or bubble man jars to,
uh, lay out at this barberry.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, I'm going to come right back in
like, uh, less than 10.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be back.
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at that cloud.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Gary talked, Gary talked about like
the parts eight months on this thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, you know, I got to just like
shout out Gary.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause it's like, um, a lot of people like
don't even, they don't go like deep,
[SPEAKER_19]: deep, deep into what goes behind the pen.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I always loved Omnicron and the,
um, samurai Sam's in the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: You, you mentioned earlier when Gary was
on hash church, he's like, what episode
[SPEAKER_13]: did Gary appear on?
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to watch it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was samurai Sam on the episode,
not Gary.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's who turned us on to Gary.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was the guy.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just saw Sam is in the room and he's
like, Hey, what episode did Gary appear
[SPEAKER_13]: on?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, that's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't had Gary on.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have Gary on one day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: He exposed like what was behind in pens
and then Garrett, and then you had
[SPEAKER_19]: mentioned, I wish we could get a tank that
was reusable, that we, uh, was more like
[SPEAKER_19]: eco-friendly, but mainly delivered the
same low temp dabs of for rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, just a solventless pen,
a real one that we can count on.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, and then you're like, if you could
make that, I'll put my name on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, okay, well, and then we
got, and then I was like, well,
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we did.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_19]: Your name's on it before you ever got to
try it, but hopefully you trust me and,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, you'll be super satisfied.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you get it, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, these things are only going to
retail for six.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they're retailing for $64,
like 62 or $64 retail.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not even in the car and the tanks
are like, I think 14.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, it's not even, it's not like
an outlandish amount.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, I think it's a fucking great
value personally.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I finally get to, I haven't really hit
my rig that much to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I was telling you, like, it's kind
of, it's so convenient that it's like,
[SPEAKER_19]: you're watching TV and you're like,
well, I could lean over and take a dab or
[SPEAKER_19]: I can just, you know, um, but I'll,
I'm going to, I'm going to jump off real
[SPEAKER_19]: quick and then come back.
[SPEAKER_19]: But hopefully Minnesota dabs comes in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I have, I want him to, uh,
explain this resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think he's got some macros.
[SPEAKER_19]: He could probably screen share that he was
talking about, but I wonder if it's,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, Azaleen or some other kind of like
terpene.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause remember if it's in the resin head,
I've never seen resin actual heads.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're talking about the heads actually
have a blue color like this.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was very unusual, um, to see.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you don't know Minnesota dabs,
you know, go to his Instagram and,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, you will see what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like Smurf, Smurf resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've seen some pretty wild colors
over the years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, if you shoot it with a flash or
without a flash, sometimes it can look
[SPEAKER_13]: pretty wild, but, uh, yeah, he's got some
unique color there for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be, I don't know what the name of
the terpene is, so I don't want to say it,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I for sure know that Jim Frayer has a
fraction.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll see that in fractionations like
people that do subcritical CO2 or they do
[SPEAKER_19]: distillation or fractional or anything
like you could pull off Azaleen in that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen blue terpenes that way.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but never in the resin head.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, cause there's chemical reactions that
Mark, uh, could probably Skulldome could
[SPEAKER_19]: probably talk about, but I was,
I just really like to see him come on
[SPEAKER_19]: because I think it will be a good start of
a question that, uh, love to see what
[SPEAKER_19]: people think, like how the colors are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would need to run an NMR and also LCMS
would be useful because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these LCMS systems draw against the
library of standards and there's literally
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of compounds that are known and
things like Azaleen are known.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, that's an easy thing to
solve if he's got a sample, about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what's really cool, you know,
we talked about, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: remember, um, uh, Intra's green terpene as
being sort of like a diluted down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, did you ever test it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause that was like, you guys talked about
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You said you were going to test it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of knew no test would ever happen,
but at the same time, I didn't want to say
[SPEAKER_13]: it when it was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The test results I saw did not look very,
I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know what, uh, the stuff that
he had brought to the cup, which I saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: test results of the not show any Azaleen
or not show any, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw any results from the,
from the green terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: From his green fraction, but his clear
terpene fraction, I did see the results
[SPEAKER_01]: of, and there's nothing remarkable there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like nothing remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just terpenes, you know,
just like you would see in a, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, he said it was a mixture
or something like that, but I think I seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to remember it had train wreck in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we know train wreck is
immersing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of mercy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it also had karyophylline and
look like it had oxidized a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was karyophylline oxide in
there too as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you actually seen, uh, Indra's
machine yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, I've seen, oh, sorry,
Mark, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was he talking to you or me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, from what I understand, there's one
that's being shipped right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to hear the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero zero zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Machine zero zero zero one is being
shipped from its factory to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's going to be set up in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be set up in a couple of weeks
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how one of those extractors
works in a commercial cannabis setting and
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to hopefully report back on some
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll get Danny from, uh,
Kerova to come on in the future and share
[SPEAKER_01]: with us some data and some key learnings
on using Indra's extractor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it'd be interesting to hear about
that for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, you guys are extracting
as I'm hash-churching.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm telling you, for those of you that
want a great cultivar for pressing rosin
[SPEAKER_13]: with or making hash with, check out Karma
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I'm definitely guessing is a play on
the amnesia haze potency of it and the
[SPEAKER_13]: getting lost in Amsterdam and not being
able to find where you parked your bike,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is also, if you've ever been to
Amsterdam and you've ever rented cars and
[SPEAKER_13]: lost those, but, uh, it does happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: The cultivar is a, you know, solid 28 to
30% yielder.
[SPEAKER_13]: And more importantly than that,
it has this beautiful terpenaline-like,
[SPEAKER_13]: haze-like rip to it that is so lemony at
first.
[SPEAKER_13]: It comes out as just straight lemons and
then turns into this hazy, really,
[SPEAKER_13]: really beautiful taste.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I got to give a shout out to Karma for
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Karma Genetics, great job, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was impressive.
[SPEAKER_13]: To see Bud squish like it was hash was
kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put a smile on my face, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_13]: The first acid trip was on a bike ride.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Andy Bravo.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the magical world that Albert
Hoffman entered.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you ever look at the interview,
he's like, I, I, I on April 19th,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: I entered a sort of dream world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, yeah, bro, you took like a fucking
heroic dose.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to be tripping balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you don't take your acid at
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like I entered, I entered the Madison
square gardens and the fish were on the
[SPEAKER_14]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was, that was me a couple of
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: You were doing chemistry.
[SPEAKER_13]: You were doing chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried two CB for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what'd you think of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, and, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very visual.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very visual.
[SPEAKER_13]: Take a small amount.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you take too much, I'll tell you the
visuals.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I saw my buddy, he took some two CB
at my house and basically for like three
[SPEAKER_13]: hours was sitting on my front lawn,
the mountain on the back wall.
[SPEAKER_13]: And later when I asked him what he was
doing, he said, bro, he said, I was doing
[SPEAKER_13]: some music and then it's like my forehead
opened up and this fucking projector came
[SPEAKER_13]: out of my skull.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I basically was like projecting a
movie, but I couldn't see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I found this spot here and I looked at
the mountain across the way and I watched
[SPEAKER_13]: this incredible, like he was in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was in the experience that he was
watching on the fucking mountain
[SPEAKER_13]: projecting out of his forehead.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, two CB is no joke.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it sounds like you needed to take a
little bit more because if he was still
[SPEAKER_00]: there, then he wasn't high enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a bit and you're only supposed to
take a very small amount of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I got back, it was all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I recommend doing it in a quiet place
with, with your lover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's, that's what I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say, it's an amazing
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't do it at a concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer it one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, Chris Corota, the lighting
director for fish has got an incredible,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, mechanized lighting rig that moves and
the whole lighting rig moves up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, first of all, the lights are
incredible and there's like laser beams
[SPEAKER_01]: and lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually there's lights installed in
Madison square garden that are only used
[SPEAKER_01]: for the New York Rangers and the New York
Knicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chris was the lighting director who
actually had those installed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for all other musical acts that come to
Madison square garden, only fish gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: use these lights and their lights all
throughout the arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole arena is a light show and the
rig moving up and down on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, yeah, it was pretty,
pretty incredible in terms of a
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's, I guess where you want to
be when you're, when you're doing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It definitely takes you on a journey.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the journeys that I have been
taken on by Chris Corota and, and,
[SPEAKER_13]: and fish and, uh, um, sound man there,
what's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Paul Langwood doc is no longer the
sound guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's yeah, it's back when I was still
sitting in the band.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was that those were the guys and
between those guys, the four, the one in
[SPEAKER_13]: the one, it was just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mark, you should go see him now if
you get a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if they're coming.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't come to Canada too much.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, Trey's got charges down there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got charges up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I, am I, am I the only one that doses
and goes to metal shows or hardcore shows?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember dosing and going to gangrene
and social distortion, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all go to these jam bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, eh, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls it slaycation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on a slayer tour across the
country.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been watching his slayer tour.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hilarious, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls it slaycation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_15]: Driving Ferraris in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, his hemp plants are roaring
back in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure we're doing well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Sean, 8033 said he took acid and
went and saw a bar.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope he didn't stand in the first five
rows.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't want to get any of that fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seamen on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabby Hayes and showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the name of that band from Texas?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they actually had a squirt
bottle and squirted people with acid in
[SPEAKER_02]: the, in the water of the actual thing from
the stage, which I don't recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He shouldn't dose people without their
knowing that's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was like one of the two commandments.
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't Tim Leary come up with that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Never dose someone without their knowledge
and never try to keep someone from dosing
[SPEAKER_13]: if they want to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those were the two psychedelic
commandments that he came up with.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then he also came up with the worst
idea ever, which was to record his voice
[SPEAKER_13]: while he was reciting the book,
the Tibetan book of the dead.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then to tell people it's a good idea
to take acid and then listen to me
[SPEAKER_00]: reciting the great, the book of the dead,
which was like, the worst thing I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst thing he did was he told
everybody to tune in, turn it on and drop
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he showed, he should have preached
was tune in, turn it on and take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were they going to take over and
then drop out everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the bankers, the lawyers and
the accountants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they needed dosing more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doc,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're a nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to inject a little bit of
humor every now and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can't stand is humor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you don't have the patent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Touche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I have the idea though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideas are cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow through is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doc, what was the first time you got
turned on to psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at a, I remember we used to have
drive-ins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the places where we drive a car
full of teenagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Driving theater, you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooler full of beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went and saw the Pink Floyd movie
followed by the Grateful Dead movie at
[SPEAKER_01]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was like two psychedelic rock
movies back to back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had lawn chairs and I don't know if
we had a keg of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly we had a big box of Budweiser,
probably cases of beer and just drank like
[SPEAKER_01]: fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, I remember late night,
you know, when most drugs have worn off
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're still high on acid and you're
just realizing that this is unlike
[SPEAKER_01]: anything you've ever done before,
that this is a portal that you've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through now that is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think this was maybe like 1976,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when the dead movie came out,
maybe 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was it liquid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a sugar cube?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it was a piece of paper,
a blotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had the imprint was Mr. Clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like you, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bald guy with the earring holding the
orb that was shiny, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, if you have to do acid, Mr. Clean,
it's probably a good brand, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mine was Little Woodstocks from
Snoopy and Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Little Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after, like the first time we
acquired some and we had something in
[SPEAKER_01]: mass, it was Steve Miller Book of Dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the horse on the front of the
cover of Steve Miller?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was the album cover acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, and then since then on Dead
Tour, I saw just about everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: could possibly imagine in terms of just,
you know, blotter design, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: just such a fucking cool happenstance art.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a poster of... You have some
blotter designs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Cure of Souls from the
first exhibition of acid art, which
[SPEAKER_02]: actually has the acid that you're talking
about, the Steve Miller band, and it had
[SPEAKER_02]: the old Journey covers, et cetera,
et cetera, the Japanese symbols,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, what was the first acid you ever did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Purple Hossley in 1965.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When was your first bond group,
son?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same year, it was not legal,
but I didn't smoke a bong until probably
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I smoked was a joint that I
bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't bum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually bought three joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that, three joints?
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 cents each from a Russian girl at
Hollywood High School, where I went,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I didn't really smoke a bong or
anything, so I took them home,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I lit it, and I took a breath,
inhaled it, blew it out, and immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: inhaled another hit, and smoked the whole
joint like that, lit the second one,
[SPEAKER_00]: lit the third one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got totally fried.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the day your life changed,
and now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking down the street,
and it was like living color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, I know that they first
smoked, they didn't have any effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had all the effects that they
didn't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one you did was that,
what was the, have you ever done blotter
[SPEAKER_02]: acid, paper acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the first one you did?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rice paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no design stamped onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rice paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire piece of paper had been soaked,
and then they tore it up into little
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets or cut it up with paper cutters or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, bubble man, I know you're doing a
bong rip, but the questions come in your
[SPEAKER_02]: way now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the first LSD that you did?
[SPEAKER_02]: How old were you, and what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it paper, barrel, liquid,
[SPEAKER_02]: gel?
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome Minnesota Dabs who just came into
the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been trying to get in for,
I'd say about a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_13]: My first psychedelic experience was
actually not LSD.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got turned on at a very young age to
Terrence McKenna back in the early 90s,
[SPEAKER_13]: late 80s.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was these talks that he would do at the
SLM Institute in California all about
[SPEAKER_13]: psychedelic mushrooms and these little DMT
elves and self-reflecting machine elves
[SPEAKER_13]: and all this crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were reading about it, listening about
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were like, we got to get this going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our first trips was really like a
therapeutic dose, let's just say,
[SPEAKER_13]: like fried grams in the semi-dark kind of
room where you have shadow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a heroic dose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, it's like a heroic dose or
whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We always like to call it therapeutic
because when you do a dose that you're
[SPEAKER_13]: blowing your ego right out the door,
it's heroic before you do it while you
[SPEAKER_13]: have your ego, but once your ego is gone,
it really just becomes therapeutic because
[SPEAKER_13]: there is no heroism when you have no ego.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the SLM Institute in Big Sur?
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, real beautiful sight.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear us, Minnesota?
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh oh, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes there's a few little things that
can go wrong with the sound.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes you might have to redo your
whole, because I'm not showing you muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not coming in as someone who's
muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be in his settings right up top
there on the settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a little gear, so click on the
settings and make sure that your mic is
[SPEAKER_02]: tuned into the right one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can sometimes be triggered by a
different one if you plug in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that most of us have these blue
other types of microphones, so it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: separate USB plug in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, that mushroom trip led me
to take many, many more mushroom trips.
[SPEAKER_13]: It led me to grow my own psychedelic
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: It led me to ordering spores from Terrence
and his wife Kat at the time had a company
[SPEAKER_13]: out of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was called Sygeny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sygeny was a spore company that Terrence
sold the spores for the stropharia
[SPEAKER_13]: cubensis that him and his brother Dennis
collected while they were in Central
[SPEAKER_13]: America in the 70s, which led to them
writing the book, which is Psilocybin
[SPEAKER_13]: Mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember the name of the book.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the first grower's guide,
How to Grow Indoor Mushrooms by O.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: Eric and O.T.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those were pen names for Terrence and
Dennis McKenna.
[SPEAKER_13]: This was in like 76 or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't come into it until almost 12
years later in the late 80s and then
[SPEAKER_13]: eventually got led into Paul Stamets,
which is also, he's been a huge
[SPEAKER_13]: inspiration in the mushroom world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, you guys can Google him and
find out anything you want about O.T.
[SPEAKER_11]: and O.T.
[SPEAKER_04]: Psychedelics the other day where he's
like, I had a lot of fun on psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_13]: I never killed anyone, never hurt anyone,
where he's kind of going through how
[SPEAKER_13]: psychedelics aren't so bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, they're pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you love the cannabis community,
the psychedelic community is even smaller.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you go to these little gatherings,
you can literally meet anyone in that
[SPEAKER_13]: community that you want by going to one of
the larger psychedelic gatherings that
[SPEAKER_13]: happen on the West Coast and in parts of
Europe.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're definitely worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't been to one in a while,
but it's where I met Paul.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where I met Finn McKenna,
Terrence's son.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cool spot to meet people.
[SPEAKER_13]: We still can't hear you, Minnesota Dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: You might have to shut your browser,
like shut your computer down and restart
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That does work sometimes, just restarting
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: This Google Chat can just give people a
real hard time sometimes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Subcool, he's probably at his garden now.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's probably trying to get the internet
working.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well enough so he can show us some plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that he came in last week and we
weren't able to acknowledge him.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome back, Sub.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like you're relaxed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, there you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at those bushes, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got, six of them over there?
[SPEAKER_18]: 12.
[SPEAKER_13]: 12, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like I'm not fucking around.
[SPEAKER_13]: These things are only 10 pounds each,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: The limit, maybe California, we can do 12
right now, so that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, those things are going to yield
some resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no size on the 12 plants that I
like to have there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can grow six plants per adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just says plants.
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Battery, 90%.
[SPEAKER_17]: Connected to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh good, our battery's at 92%.
[SPEAKER_13]: Connected to your D now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Press heating up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be sorry, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm chill, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, the hustle king says what's up,
Sub.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey dude, how you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a really good fan.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's saying that's a charity program.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you know, the pressing, we just press
the lower quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: With the high quality, I really want to
press kind of, I want to film it with my
[SPEAKER_13]: 4K camera, so we can't both do Hash Church
and me film, because I'm hosting Hash
[SPEAKER_13]: Church for gosh sakes and I'm still my own
cameraman.
[SPEAKER_13]: I still do all my own editing and I still
take all my own pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we get the quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just find some other quality people doing
quality shit, but I'm too busy just doing
[SPEAKER_13]: shit to even go look for them.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they're out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some very, very capable people out
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you got there, Tony?
[SPEAKER_13]: That looks ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I need some of that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a banana right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strawberry banana turf sauce.
[SPEAKER_09]: That looked greasy.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is strawberry banana goo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the goo.
[SPEAKER_19]: This was a rejected label, because I
thought it looked too kiddy, so we got
[SPEAKER_19]: different bubble man labels, but I figured
for this special jar today, I made some
[SPEAKER_19]: strawberry banana goo, like soft.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is like pretty saucy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Use the restricted label.
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost the consistency of what I put in
the pan.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to make it even saucier.
[SPEAKER_19]: And one thing when mixing the terpenes,
wait four or five days.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's hard, but once you mix them
in, like actually mix them in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Things happen when you wait.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good things come to those who wait.
[SPEAKER_19]: This was some 73 first pull from the
Greenhams.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was washed, that was white,
and then pressed, and then turped.
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes people think, oh,
well, it's a different color.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, all I can tell you is that it's not
a heat thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: This has to do with the age of the resin,
or the maturity of the resin, and or when
[SPEAKER_19]: the terpenes mix.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's five days in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not like the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: That other stuff was fresh.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is from Greenhams.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's another strawberry banana goo.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's from full melt that's been
pressed with turps.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this consistency could go in the pan,
too.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have Etienne.
[SPEAKER_19]: Etienne, I will come to you today,
wherever you're at, after I'm done at this
[SPEAKER_19]: lounge.
[SPEAKER_19]: I will bring you your kit.
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one is... Turn this thing
around.
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one has lemon remedy,
but then I'll have strawberry banana goo.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I want you to try it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's unusual.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have like a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just kind of like limited runs of
them, because there's just not a lot of
[SPEAKER_19]: material of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it is an unbelievable, different,
unique variety that I think you'll enjoy
[SPEAKER_19]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_19]: So after today, at some point,
I will come find you and give you one of
[SPEAKER_19]: these.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to have a nice thing
brought by and gifted to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check out this Barbary Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a really cool place.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bro, if you could come meet.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're, we're gassing up.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're about... No, I'm not going to be
able to make it today, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I want to, it sounds like a
place I want to check out for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always wrong with my rigs.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say that, I mean, it's just,
you know, first of all, they have the bar
[SPEAKER_19]: there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was really professional.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had people that cleaned your
mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_19]: They Q-tipped for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had six or seven rigs all plugged in,
all cords, all different, different types
[SPEAKER_19]: of rigs.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had just solventless.
[SPEAKER_19]: So only solventless would ever touch the
rig.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then they have, then they have like one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[SPEAKER_19]: eight.
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably 11 or 12 going off the memory.
[SPEAKER_19]: Square tables that had long, long lounges
and chairs, but every table has a plug
[SPEAKER_19]: that comes through the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can take your rig, plug in your own
nail and you can order from their menu in
[SPEAKER_19]: the other room and hang out in a lounge.
[SPEAKER_19]: The smoking from the dab bar was
separated.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it wasn't like smoky at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been a lot of places, Spain and
Amsterdam and different places.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was, I was there to do
[SPEAKER_19]: some Prana training and information.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, Oh, I need to come back
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a cool place.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was a cool place to hang out,
which I don't, I don't see that anywhere.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see, I mean, maybe there's a
couple of them around, but I don't really
[SPEAKER_19]: see a legal spot to like do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just sounds like he's puffing.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's coughing.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's moving shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's putting things in the cup holders.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh no, there's nobody in the car.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's completely silent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's not coming through silent.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll send you the recording.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy loud.
[SPEAKER_13]: It must be you doing a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the phone mic is super sensitive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then maybe it's someone else in the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Minnesota, you're in.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, finally.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that was, that was a job and a half.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not, I'm working on a video right now,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll just take a second, but uh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's coming through a little scratchy.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a plugin camera.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to get my shit together eventually
and start doing this like the week or the
[SPEAKER_13]: day before, because this is, it happens to
every single person I invite in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or that my friends invite in that it's,
there's always a technical difficulty.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we just did it the night before,
we could avoid all this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause you've been trying for over a half
an hour to get into the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but your mic's not coming in through
good.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's scratchy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like it's a Minnesota go with a headset,
plug in your headset and don't go through
[SPEAKER_19]: your computer.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say that's one of the worst.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes that's the, the, the camera.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the USB, you kind of have to unplug
it and plug it in or something,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I don't know what kind of camera he
has.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if he's coming in on a phone.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that I was hearing a lot of stuff
through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I need an assistant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many different people.
[SPEAKER_13]: What you really need to do is just the
Saturday is just run the, the go through
[SPEAKER_13]: the chat, but it's not as easy as you
think people.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm busy on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_13]: So are people.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't always get to the computer at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, my stuff runs fine, but this morning
my mic wouldn't trigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to restart it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just happened.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm experienced.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it just 140 times and he came in
today's like, I'm like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on my whole computer was messed
up today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, it took me 20 minutes to start a hash
church today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to stop it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I came back.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I definitely know you're paying
Minnesota dabs because I've experienced it
[SPEAKER_13]: today.
[SPEAKER_13]: My personal self.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would like to hear from you though.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it gets working.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard to be on the tech tricone
farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_19]: One other thing, one other thing,
Minnesota turn off the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, just if you were watching hash charts,
turn it off in the background,
[SPEAKER_19]: put your headphones in or muted in the
background, then put your headphones in.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the only other thing that could
possibly cause that would be, um,
[SPEAKER_19]: if your, if your, um, if your internal mic
was like, dirty or something was laying on
[SPEAKER_19]: it, but if you use the headphones,
you should be, you should be all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you guys, I'm going to go check out
this air show.
[SPEAKER_03]: The planes are flying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go smoke some fatties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope everyone has a hashish Sunday.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: No John, you don't get to leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: My back's killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to sit there longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to like watch you guys,
but I just got to stand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm moving so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for coming in, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to take a long rip for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see you soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I
[SPEAKER_13]: can't wait to, uh, squish this wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause right after hash charts for me,
it's like, the pressing of 140 grams of
[SPEAKER_13]: hash on this new little, uh, M one that
just, uh, I pressed up a couple of photos,
[SPEAKER_13]: a couple of, uh, took a couple of photos
of what I pressed up yesterday,
[SPEAKER_13]: which I guess I, I think I uploaded on my
Instagram, but, uh, see if I can share one
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: What lens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the MP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason all those bubbles are in it
is because he used BHL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is unpurged rosin.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on, I didn't purge it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, I'm still learning how to purge
my rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, dude, if you're not purging it,
it's pretty dirty at this point.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just boil it on a hot plate.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can turn the hot plate up as hot as
possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just filter after you boil it,
you'll get, you'll, you'll clean it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to stay right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just put it on the griddle until
it starts to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Put a cup over it, put a straw under it,
inhale it while you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a blanket with your head inside the
blanket.
[SPEAKER_11]: So bomb though, like the quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I learned that on Ashtridge.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really hope he can get in because I
wanted to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_19]: So while he's sitting there, do you think
about color in the resin though?
[SPEAKER_19]: Like what would promote, you know,
that particular color, a plum or a blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: I presume it's a terpene, but it could be
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's why, it would really be
nice is to have it analyzed so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see what unusual has a high peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a must.
[SPEAKER_19]: We could see if there was a spike there,
right?
Something.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could also potentially be a mutant form
of anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not all anthocyanin is like purple purple.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe the anthocyanin goes from the stem
to the head.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, yeah, like a mutated form.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just like continues forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen a lot of varieties that
were light pinkish, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've seen that much more common,
but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, especially you also see, uh,
where the white hairs turn, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of turning red orange with old
age, uh, they at a young age start turning
[SPEAKER_00]: pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know for sure what's causing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think you guys have listed a couple
of the likely suspects, but drug guy says
[SPEAKER_13]: it's not a mutant form.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthocyanins appear different colors at
different P H's.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's why there's some different
color anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_13]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish he would click the link and come
talk with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're here for you when you need us,
drug guy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I have another subject that I wanted
to bring up because we were kind of
[SPEAKER_19]: talking about this the other day and,
uh, because it came up with the two
[SPEAKER_19]: different types of, uh, things that you
would put into tanks.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, it started with the kind of the
base of what's inside this.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, we're talking about
different defining the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_19]: experience because it's kind of lumped
into a category.
[SPEAKER_19]: But within that category, there's really,
there's a couple of pathways that we're
[SPEAKER_19]: talking about THC in a sense that all of
the rosin, live rosin sauces and things
[SPEAKER_19]: that we put into this tank are high
terpene paired with THCA and it's not
[SPEAKER_19]: having, it's not being decarbonized.
[SPEAKER_19]: They are boxulated first, like a
distillate.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the, uh, we're talking about in the
one, uh, project with Gold Drop and Blue
[SPEAKER_19]: River, we have distillate in turps and
that gives you a type of psychoactive
[SPEAKER_19]: experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now when you have, uh, hash or rosin,
you know, the same terpene profile or what
[SPEAKER_19]: have you, uh, side by side, you have then
B experience of that psychoactive
[SPEAKER_19]: experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what's the significant difference
in vaporizing the same variety with the
[SPEAKER_19]: same terpene profile and it's raw form
THCA versus trying to deliver that when
[SPEAKER_19]: they fully activated, you know,
THC and the same terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going on mechanically there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, first of all, Tony, I doubt that it
does have the exact same terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one is decarboxylated and one is not,
then, uh, that must have had some effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we've removed, remember in those,
so we removed the terpenes first and then
[SPEAKER_19]: we get to the oil and then we,
uh, do like a triple molecular
[SPEAKER_19]: distillation on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that process gives you a 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: One difference is when you're returning
the terpenes, uh, how many is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10?
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 20, 30, 50, uh, uh, 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many terpenes are you
returning to a variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it would have been analyzed,
how many terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's what, what, which SC labs
test for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to 36.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we only get, so out of all of them that
are, there's always, I would say with,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, these terpene profiles,
you get a hit on almost all of them that
[SPEAKER_19]: they show, but I agree.
[SPEAKER_19]: So.
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_19]: The terpene profile is not the same,
but my, my more question, let's say
[SPEAKER_19]: relatively, let's say you're relatively
dominant in the 10 terpenes for each one
[SPEAKER_19]: of those types.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm more focused on the THCA versus the
THC in the actual vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, how is it being consumed by the
people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it being vaporized, smoked or oral?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they take it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's say, let's say they're either both
dabbed or they're both in a vapor in a
[SPEAKER_19]: tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you vape or you smoke THCA,
you converted to THC bang, bang,
[SPEAKER_00]: wham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_19]: Immediately right at the, right.
[SPEAKER_19]: All the, all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting in five seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not smoking any THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smoking THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, so what you're saying, just so we're,
so I'm clear because this is where I
[SPEAKER_19]: wanted the discussion to go.
[SPEAKER_19]: Was you're saying that in the,
in the 10 seconds that that hash or rosin
[SPEAKER_19]: hits a quartz banger, you're saying that's
enough time and enough temperature to
[SPEAKER_19]: fully decarboxylate that THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it takes several hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phase is decarboxylated THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no vapor phase component of THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you don't see THCA in a GC,
GC trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you're going to see is THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, say that a little louder,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you don't see THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, before that, before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no vapor phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no vapor phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vapor phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of when he hits the nail and, and now the,
the, the resin, which is a semi-solid or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar, if it's a, if it's THCA,
it's crystalline THCA immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's in the vapor phase above that
is now vapor phase, you know, THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: not THCA.
[SPEAKER_19]: But, but you have to keep, keep in mind
there's, this is going to be a hash rosin
[SPEAKER_19]: or a flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not just THCA.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's 70% THCA and 30% of other,
uh, terpenes and fats or what have you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the presence of that, but we were
talking about the THC versus THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the presence converts it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I know smoking converts it,
but if we're dapping something,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, or vaporizing something in the 350 dot
50 range to 500 range for a short period
[SPEAKER_19]: of time, is that enough time to convert
the THCA?
[SPEAKER_19]: And you just said that there's no vapor
for THCA.
[SPEAKER_19]: So has that been thoroughly discovered,
uh, all the way?
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, or is that just because.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just studied and been the kinetics are
known and you can't keep this from
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decarboxylation is instantaneous at that
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and now what you're doing also
is there are kinetically, once
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylation happens, you can start
hydrogenating the methyl cyclohexene ring
[SPEAKER_01]: up to CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will start to happen in the
presence of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but for the most part, THC is
vaporized from the decarboxylation of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, thermal decarboxylation of THCA and
it's irreversible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reaction once it's entropically flip
favored because they're splitting off a
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule of CO2 that can never,
no way recombine with the THC to make
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the arrow is a one way arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it's a one way trip from THCA to THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what's the temperature point for that
to instantaneously happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the temperature just very slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all depends on the rate,
the reaction rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is directly proportional to the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this has been studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different temperatures, you have
different reaction rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think after like a 110 degrees
centigrade, 90% of decarboxylation has
[SPEAKER_01]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's just, you know,
there is a chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember reading a report about the,
uh, volcano pipe and they said a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of the THCA is delivered
undecarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I don't know how that fits in with
what you're talking about vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if their, uh,
uh, research was correct or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I did read that a very tiny amount of
it was delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was always wondering, are
vaporizers as good as a regular pipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was years and years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I realized was at the time,
most of the vaporizers were not delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: as big of a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if you put one gram of
marijuana or one gram of extract or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever in it, the vaporizer would make
10, five or 10 inhalations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you could do it in a bong,
in a pipe, in one hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it was different comparing apples
to oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a real difference between why I
couldn't find bongs that were,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I mean, uh, vaporizers that were
satisfying like the volcano.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I find, um, uh, it's hard to explain
the difference when I'm hitting these,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, these types of tanks that are more in
the, more of like the raw or a live rosin
[SPEAKER_19]: that has all of these other organic
components and compounds and other things
[SPEAKER_19]: in there versus super refined,
clean 90 something percent distillate with
[SPEAKER_19]: a terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're two completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like all those little things,
then there's no way the distillates going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be as good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, different.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I would say like the distillate with
the terms comes on much stronger.
[SPEAKER_19]: Or faster right away.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it's, um, very kind of almost
like a precise, um, uh, like kind of a
[SPEAKER_19]: precise, like if I compared the two
together, I would say like the distillate
[SPEAKER_19]: was more like precise.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I was more center focused with my
experience there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then in this type of, uh, in the raw
form with all of its, uh, other compounds,
[SPEAKER_19]: it's more of a more of like, um,
you know, out the ears, more expanding,
[SPEAKER_19]: more expansive than it's a slower effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that that's specific to,
you know, whether you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylation or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think decarboxylation is how you get the
compounds into where the CB1 receptors are
[SPEAKER_01]: in your brain and crossing the blood brain
barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think decarboxylation is required for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's people who are looking at
the delivery of the acid itself and how
[SPEAKER_01]: the acid can be delivered across the
membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, the cannabinoid acids just
have a different, a different
[SPEAKER_01]: translocation, uh, than, uh, through the
cell wall than, than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylated analogs because of the acid
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so exactly sure, Tony, I think that,
you know, again, this goes back to if you
[SPEAKER_01]: purified that THCA by subsequent
recrystallizations and you can do that in
[SPEAKER_01]: pentane is a good recrystallization
solvent and just recrystallize it over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over and over again to where you
have pure THCA, you again may not have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same effect because the entourage or the
ensemble effect of, of those five to 15%
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff that's in, in your sugar is
probably causing that effect and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not necessarily due to whether
decarboxyl, decarboxylation I think has to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in order for you to feel the high
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, so just, so if we had a delivery
device that can deliver this without any
[SPEAKER_19]: heat and no decarboxyl it would be,
it would be, it would be something that
[SPEAKER_19]: would be, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think delivery and, uh,
there's a guy who's studying this right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: His first name is Guillermo and his last
name escapes me, but I think he's a
[SPEAKER_01]: professor in San Diego and he's studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the guy who, he's the guy who
published a paper, can you pass the acid
[SPEAKER_01]: test?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was referring to THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I think delivering THCA
across the blood brain barrier is a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant achievement if it could,
if it could happen, like if it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow like solubilized and, you know,
with oil or something like that to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it delivered, you know,
across the blood brain barrier with
[SPEAKER_00]: ultrasonics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that gets it across the blood
brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it'll deliver it to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the blood brain barrier is a
really delicate dance of hydrophobicity
[SPEAKER_01]: and sterics to be able to get through and
not all compounds get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, and again, this is sort of a
general theory is that terpenes kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: loosen up the locks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So terpenes kind of let stuff flow in and
out of the membrane a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: More so than if they weren't there at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of the ensemble effect,
part of that effect just might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, an enhanced exchange between the
interior and exterior portion of the cell.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been getting this incredible
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm mixing crack cocaine in with my
bubble.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that would be a really bad joke.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, welcome to D420K.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on, buddy?
[SPEAKER_14]: Bon rep, everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Minnesota Dabs back in the house.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you guys hear me at all this time?
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, sorry, Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, there it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot of the background noises
coming from Tony's car.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's quiet now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can hear you, Preston.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_21]: You can hear me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, how's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about time I got in.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm on a crappy webcam, so I really can't
show the color of it too much,
[SPEAKER_21]: but.
[SPEAKER_21]: The perps.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think it has any, it might
have something to do with the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_21]: but actual trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_21]: These are really interesting themselves,
where all of ice with, like, it's all
[SPEAKER_21]: inkblot, and every trichome head is
individual with its own style inkblot when
[SPEAKER_21]: you look underneath the scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the plants when they're
growing, is there this color coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem, the resin stem underneath the
head?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm actually, are you talking the stalk of
the resin head?
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not like most of the other strains,
like cookies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've noticed has a solid purple stalk,
and then the resin heads are clear amber.
[SPEAKER_21]: But this one doesn't really have that.
[SPEAKER_21]: This one to me looks like it's an inkblot,
like inside of the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not super melty.
[SPEAKER_21]: So what it is is I'm thinking it has a
really thick shell on the trichome.
[SPEAKER_21]: The trichome head with just a little bit
of that goodness in there, each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make a rosin out of it,
what color is the rosin?
[SPEAKER_21]: The rosin actually comes out like this
little bit of a pinkish color,
[SPEAKER_21]: purple to it.
[SPEAKER_21]: But you got to hold it a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pressing blue and you're getting
pink or purple.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not really blue.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll go get a big jar out of the freezer
to show you.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like it was a little more like
normal rosin, though.
[SPEAKER_19]: It didn't look that blue or purple.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it doesn't carry over the rosin at
all, really.
[SPEAKER_21]: It just has a slight tinge to it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll grab you the big jar and show you the
big jar.
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds like what he's saying is there
is a thicker wall of this head,
[SPEAKER_19]: and in it has some form of ink block
impression.
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe when he's pressing it,
the skins of the walls of the trichomes
[SPEAKER_19]: are being caught in the 25.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so hold that a little wheeze
away from your camera.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit further.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can really see the purple hue for
certain right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell him to talk so Mark can see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: What was that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm holding the camera on his … Oh,
I see.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's got his camera set up so you have to
talk for him to see it on his computer.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually got some dry sift I'm going to
go grab for Sam right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I made some dry sift of this last night.
[SPEAKER_21]: It didn't come out as purple.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's half of this purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Purple resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what these kids are doing these days.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope you appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I tried to seek out a unique guest because
I think that's pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw that going around and I was like,
hmm.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was like a little
photography.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I look closer and I'm like,
it seems very rare and unusual of what's
[SPEAKER_19]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_21]: The turf profile on this is like no other
I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing comes close to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to figure out what it is?
[SPEAKER_21]: What is?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is making the color?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, what compound is found in
it that's not found in other varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have that color?
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear you totally.
[SPEAKER_21]: The thing with me is I'm a single source
farmer.
[SPEAKER_21]: In the state of Michigan, our plant
rights, I can have 72 plants, but I'm only
[SPEAKER_21]: allowed two and a half ounces per patient.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's me and five other patients.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he's talking about he wants to get
it tested, my man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you had it?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't had it tested yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it purple?
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have enough material to do that
yet.
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally, my whole garden is going to this.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a single guy.
[SPEAKER_21]: I do everything from gardening to making
the hash to packaging the hash.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm super single source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it only takes like a quarter of a
gram for the test.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be totally down for that.
[SPEAKER_21]: In Michigan, they hit us for a gram.
[SPEAKER_21]: They want a gram to test anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's because they're doing a bioassay.
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to have something to smoke.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're doing both the chemistry test and
the bioassay.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like, we're going to need to smoke
three quarters of a gram.
[SPEAKER_19]: With two grams, you could find out a whole
world of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they send me five grams, I'll tell them
exactly what I think.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm going to be at the Nine Times
Cup down in Michigan again the 9th and
[SPEAKER_21]: 10th of September and 40 grams of this
down there.
[SPEAKER_21]: If anybody's from out in the Cali area,
make sure they stop by my booth.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll make sure I get some aside so some
can go to the hash church, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit, 9th and 10th.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm up in Toronto at the Karma Cup on the
exact same days.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we're both going to be at a booth,
both at an event, and both dabbing people
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see if you can.
[SPEAKER_19]: Does Michigan test for serpents and such?
[SPEAKER_19]: You can take a gram and a half and get
your potency and your terpene and potency
[SPEAKER_19]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to cross this variety with
cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'd have blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_19]: It would smell like cheese, but be blue.
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be funny if it looked blue and
smelled like cheese.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the flower there?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the flower comes out just purple as
can be as well.
[SPEAKER_21]: I bet you the flower.
[SPEAKER_21]: For the secret cup, I entered— People hold
it up to your camera.
[SPEAKER_13]: People hold it up to your camera and not
spit like just 10 seconds, because it'll
[SPEAKER_13]: show nicer that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many weeks has this grown?
[SPEAKER_21]: This is actually harvested anywhere from
55 to 58 days.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pull back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a real fast one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just a little bit more further back.
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it sun-grown or is this grown under
lights?
[SPEAKER_21]: This is grown under double-ended HPSs.
[SPEAKER_21]: HPS metal halide blend.
[SPEAKER_21]: The actual strain of this is a Girl Scout
cookie phenol times Tangy, and then Tangy
[SPEAKER_21]: times GDP, and then M2 Cross together.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was made by phenotype farmers out in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did someone ask you what nutrients you've
been growing that with?
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people asked in the chat room
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I grow 100% organic, Mark.
[SPEAKER_21]: I make 100% amended soil, 26 amendments.
[SPEAKER_21]: All my plants get is just water and
beneficial teas and microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_21]: Brings out more of that flavor,
that organic, than anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Kymar is in the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: The flow of secretory products down the
trichome stock.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, this is available online.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's David Potter's thesis from GW.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is one of Sam's students.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a thesis he did called The
Propagation Characterization and
[SPEAKER_24]: Optimization.
[SPEAKER_24]: They did a bunch of trichome work,
microscopes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is one of their varieties that
has—you can see these purple vesicles in
[SPEAKER_24]: the resin gland head.
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm not sure it's the same thing,
but it could be this.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like I was saying, Marcus, earlier,
anthocyanins, they've taken anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_24]: pigments and moved them around in trying
to develop flowers of different colors.
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things that's a big drive,
it's worth big money in the flower
[SPEAKER_24]: industry, is to make a blue rose.
[SPEAKER_24]: They've taken these anthocyanin pigments
and moved them around from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things they realized is that as
they end up in different tissues or
[SPEAKER_24]: different vacuoles in different plants,
those little compartments have different
[SPEAKER_24]: pHs in different plants.
[SPEAKER_24]: When you have a different pH plus that
anthocyanin pigment, it changes the color
[SPEAKER_24]: of the pigment.
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if it's related.
[SPEAKER_24]: I just thought I'd pop in and show this
because it could be something related to
[SPEAKER_24]: this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_13]: You should come by soon and squish
something with me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got this new little rosin press that is
really fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an open invitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show it to you real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys have been playing with it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this also Sasquatch?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's them over there, part of the team.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're Sasquatched.
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like they've been squished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're squished.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, is that the new desktop model,
the Sasquatch?
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, what I really like about it is no
loud air compressor.
[SPEAKER_14]: This little guy right here will close
these things so fast.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's five of these close the
plates completely, or six.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you can pump it with the pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a little gauge that can go in.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's the one thing we're
missing, so you can actually see the
[SPEAKER_13]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big a bag of heads can you fit in the
plates on that model?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think the maximum would be on
that model there, Matt?
[SPEAKER_06]: 14 grams.
[SPEAKER_14]: 14 grams of hash?
[SPEAKER_14]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Flowers?
[SPEAKER_13]: 14 grams of flowers, so that's a lot of
hash that you could fit in there then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a good ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is the envelope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you show me an envelope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, do you guys have the screen over
there?
[SPEAKER_13]: These ones are the smaller screens that
he's saying he could fit about 14 grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: These ones fit 70 grams of herb.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 grams of hash, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are 25 micron?
[SPEAKER_15]: 32?
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys have 36?
[SPEAKER_15]: 35.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mine are 32 micron, the ones that I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so you're not using your own bags?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I do use my own bags as well,
but I'm a super humble dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be like, I'm better at promoting
other people's companies than my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to respond,
I'm much too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of stainless steel bags?
[SPEAKER_13]: Propressing?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a huge fan of it myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're awkward.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're difficult.
[SPEAKER_13]: They conduct heat, so they raise the heat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you like them?
[SPEAKER_05]: It can damage your blocks, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and it can damage your blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think very much of the resin
absorbs into the screen?
[SPEAKER_13]: It depends on how efficient you are.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how when you give bong rips and
some people take the whole thing and you
[SPEAKER_13]: feel great about it, but other people
leave like two thirds of it melted into
[SPEAKER_13]: the screen and you have to tell them,
yeah, you got to keep hitting it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're like, no, no, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're like, no, no, it melted into the
screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep hitting it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like the same thing with this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people know how to hit it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some people are like, just like fill
it up with oil and leave it there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're inefficient, if you don't
follow simple rules, like for instance,
[SPEAKER_13]: Matt told a very, very good tip yesterday
that we filmed as he was filling it up
[SPEAKER_13]: with blood.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was kind of breaking them up.
[SPEAKER_13]: He said, you know, you really want to
square off the corners.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to fill the buds right into the
corners, pack them in, pack the whole top.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no round corners because those
are places that will create air spaces and
[SPEAKER_13]: air spaces are places that will trap oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, put it this way.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got like 28.5% or 28.7% off of the
Where's My Bike.
[SPEAKER_13]: He thought it would get 30.
[SPEAKER_13]: We might have had a percent left in the
little thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe less.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard to say how efficient we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of anybody who's
gotten a high extraction and then taken
[SPEAKER_00]: that material and put it in a desiccator
to see what percentage of it is water?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the material itself, when you got the
really high... The rosin that comes out of
[SPEAKER_10]: the device.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, to me, the rosin has moisture in
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It won't hit properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll sputter.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll like, it'll pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of the... But you don't know
what the minimum maximum is.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when people are talking about
doing, they're saying they like to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: with fairly damp buds because they get a
better result.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't like to do it with too damp
of a bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to do it with just like the...
Moisture content is so important because
[SPEAKER_13]: if you don't have enough of it in there,
you know, the moisture is kind of really
[SPEAKER_00]: what's getting everything out and
getting... I understand exactly,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, but I guess what I'm getting at is
aren't the ones with higher moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: contents putting more moisture in the
rosin than ones with lower moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget anything else.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'll tell you, the stuff we used
yesterday was very, very dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wasn't that Where's My Bike like... Or was
it the headbanger that he was worried
[SPEAKER_13]: about how dry it was?
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like 5% moisture or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what do you think that Where's My Bike
was at?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like more like a 10, 10% moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of that moisture is fugitive
in the process and basically dissipates,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture is the driving force,
which is pushing the oil out from high
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure to lower pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And making it oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: First, making it oil while pressing it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aren't you doing this at such a
temperature that the water is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: steam?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's steam, it's just going to
evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like probably a little bit is
retained, but I would imagine that a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, if it's the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious what that retention is
and all you have to do is throw a 30-gram
[SPEAKER_00]: slab into a desiccator overnight and see
if there's any weight change.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could just do something called
the Carl Fischer titration to determine to
[SPEAKER_01]: three decimal points what the water
content in any material is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's ways that you could
determine what the moisture content is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that... And I do agree with
most of the points that if you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture level too high, it's probably
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's way too low, it screws up
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand the need of a sweet point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious, you know, what that has
of an effect on the moisture level of the
[SPEAKER_00]: material when you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one thing- Well, I think- Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture, pressure, and temperature all
play an integral role, and the material
[SPEAKER_01]: itself being the ultimate variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the resin content and the extrudable
material on what you're pressing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, temperature, pressure, and- I assume
once it's been pressed, you want rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: with as low a moisture content as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I don't think rosin is not
very hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the terpene content will
sort of attenuate its ability to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, it's not very water- It's
not a water-compatible environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the water is lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little water remains behind.
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it looks like a delicious dab.
[SPEAKER_23]: Fucking tasted like heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mark, going back to Sam's question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he asked about the bag makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it was nylon or whether it was
steel, or is that what he asked?
[SPEAKER_01]: A wire mesh or some kind of metal?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what other fabrics or like people were
asking about different parchment papers
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, what is the ideal parchment
paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all of those papers,
I think without exception, are coated with
[SPEAKER_01]: something because they have to be coated
so the paper doesn't stick together in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of making the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these materials could impact the
material that you're pressing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're pressing it at such
temperature where terpenes, which are good
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent, can essentially start to
solubilize and move things around.
[SPEAKER_13]: So- I said this from the start that people
shouldn't just use any bags that like the
[SPEAKER_13]: bags that I use for bubble bags,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like pharmaceutical screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's super high grade.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's heat stamped and pressure tested.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when it gets hot and it gets put under
pressure, it doesn't change its form.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't off gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't like- Is it nylon, Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the material itself nylon?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's polyethylene nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not nylon or polyester?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not nylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because the most common screens that
I saw were polyester.
[SPEAKER_13]: Understand this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every type of screen is being used on the
market right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you ask most companies, oh,
what kind of screen you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just be like, we're not even sure,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common ones in the silk screening
industry were Nibalt and Polymon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them were Swiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and both of them were Swiss.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So China has a whole other range of
different screens.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't buy my screen in China.
[SPEAKER_13]: I never have because they don't have that
quality screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't even find it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like I have to buy it in Switzerland,
and it's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it doesn't make your rosin taste like
plastic or rubber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I had some choppy internet there for
a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you say that these are made of
nylon, Mark?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I did not.
[SPEAKER_13]: Should we go over this for the fourth
time?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had choppy internet for like- I didn't
use the actual screen type that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not using nylon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but it's some kind of, it's a
plastic, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's a Nitex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering again what the
material is because not all materials are
[SPEAKER_01]: meant to be heated up, and certainly some
materials- Exactly what I was saying,
[SPEAKER_13]: and exactly why, if you heard when I first
said it, why the screens I use for bubble
[SPEAKER_13]: bags are good is because they have a heat
and a pressure rating.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are tested to be heated up a certain
amount and to be pressurized a certain
[SPEAKER_13]: amount.
[SPEAKER_13]: So these screens come from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's super fucking expensive screen,
and it's so that whatever process they're
[SPEAKER_13]: using it in, that it doesn't change form.
[SPEAKER_13]: For me, I didn't care about the pressure
and the heat.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I cared about was that when I put it
in and out of water many, many,
[SPEAKER_13]: many times, like over the course of 20
years, that the holes themselves didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: lose form, like silk and the majority of
these other types of screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're woven, but they're not heat
stamped to the point where they're never
[SPEAKER_13]: going to change this unless you melt them.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to heat them way over 500 degrees
or something to get them to melt to change
[SPEAKER_13]: the size and the hole of the screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for me, that was the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, the diameter of the thread and the
ratio of the thread versus hole surface,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is when you get into screening,
it's not just about how small the hole is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about how wide of a diameter the
screen threads are because that makes up
[SPEAKER_13]: how much of your hole is open and the
whole screen is actually screen material.
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are ratios that if you go the
wrong way and you get too thick of a hole,
[SPEAKER_13]: a fiber that makes these holes very small,
even though the holes are the same size,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's the craziest thing, shit doesn't fall
through them the same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it took me a while to learn about,
what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent many years learning about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found out in the end was one
of the most interesting screen was super
[SPEAKER_00]: thin metal sheets that they were using for
fabric printing and they were laser
[SPEAKER_00]: drilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had round holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love, in fact, the stainless steel units
that we're making for commercial water
[SPEAKER_13]: hash extraction will have those exact
laser perforated round holes is when you
[SPEAKER_13]: no longer have to be obsessed with the
thread diameter of your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's, but you still want as
much open surface versus covered surface.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody's here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I could say, Mark, I still have a set of
your bags from when I met you in
[SPEAKER_21]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it was the 23rd or 24th.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was one of the last cups there when it
got rated that day when they came in.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just didn't see you the day before.
[SPEAKER_14]: They always start with me.
[SPEAKER_14]: They go to my booth first in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're busting the whole cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like, we're at, we know where to
start.
[SPEAKER_13]: They come over all mad with the tax guys
and the 10 police.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Mila had a booth right next to
that year.
[SPEAKER_13]: My partner, well, my, we work distributors
for one another, Doug from Hempworks and
[SPEAKER_13]: HempHydlum and me for, but with bubble
bags, we distribute each other's products.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess a guy who was one of his
friends was on acid that day and he had
[SPEAKER_13]: all this weed that he brought from like
California or Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, he wanted to keep the man in
Amsterdam had like two half pounds and he
[SPEAKER_13]: had this huge crazy, like, you know,
those little containers that you have to
[SPEAKER_13]: push the button to get the lid off or it's
like a vacuum and you can't get it off.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he had like a five gallon one.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so he had, he stuffed it full of all
this weed he had cause he was so high.
[SPEAKER_13]: He heard there were cops around.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he stuffed it behind Adam's
booth, Adam and Doug's booth, the other
[SPEAKER_13]: partner in this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they started with our booth.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course they found this like two
pounds or pound and a half a weed right
[SPEAKER_13]: away.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, is that going to be a pain in
the ass for you?
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, oh yeah, I'll be going through
court for two years with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people hid their stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it in a plastic bag and put it in
the bottom of the trash cans.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I saw a lot of that, but there was
also stash.
[SPEAKER_13]: All over the floors.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a pretty crazy, crazy experience to
have those cops.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what people didn't know that the
getting busted for weed and hash was
[SPEAKER_13]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the tax people that were there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you admitted that you were selling
things, Oh my God, dude, that was,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's the pants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So right away, I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_13]: My Doug is living in Holland for how many
years?
[SPEAKER_13]: 20 years, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: He tells me right away.
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, listen, we were making the sales
and I'm your distributor.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's like, okay, well that's all you
have to say.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, don't go and tell them, you know,
like that you're making sales on the side
[SPEAKER_13]: because that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, no problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not making any sales on the side.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, it worked out very well for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I saw other people going,
Oh yeah, we're keeping receipts.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like those are the tech, they didn't know
that the yellow jacket people who are the
[SPEAKER_13]: tax people, the revenue, whatever they're
called in, in the Holland.
[SPEAKER_13]: What are they called in the Netherlands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the last thing Dennis, the last thing
Dean's last in Dean's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: I walked into the event like 10 minutes
after they left and there was nobody,
[SPEAKER_21]: it was like crickets in there.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, nobody knew what to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, I was puffing bowls because
the whole time we were getting searched,
[SPEAKER_13]: I puffed bowls and the whole time they
made us sit there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I puffed bowls with all the people around
me were who were holding five grams each
[SPEAKER_13]: of all my hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that was what was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have five grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw so many people stash bags underneath
trash cans inside the bottom of trash
[SPEAKER_00]: cans, uh, up in the air down in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what their problem was that they
didn't have a bunch of friends with no
[SPEAKER_13]: stash because all my friends had no stash
and I just giving them five gram chunks to
[SPEAKER_13]: hold on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had like, I think Dana Larson and
Brittany, and there was like a couple of
[SPEAKER_13]: other people, like four or five people.
[SPEAKER_13]: I gave five grams of hash and I was like,
all right, okay, I'm good now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't have this hash be taken away.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was too beautiful and awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had to smoke it at legends.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can't be fucking around with the
lead stat people coming in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Doing their tax thing with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll mess around.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of, we're getting fucked
up when they were saying you could only
[SPEAKER_00]: bring five grams into the event as a,
as a, uh, uh, a person who bought a ticket
[SPEAKER_00]: and was coming to visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was so wack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at the time you could actually buy
and five grams at a time, but you could
[SPEAKER_00]: possess 30 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that event, they said, I went and
talked to the police about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, no, we have a special
dispensation, but the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can only have five grams at this
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But was that one, one not in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in like, uh, where was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the first one got busted
outside of the last one.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was on the water.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was on the water in some warehouse.
[SPEAKER_21]: The last one they had.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But where was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was Amsterdam.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of, I mean, maybe just technically
outside the limit of Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's the mayor of the place that it
was from flipped out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember seeing her on the news.
[SPEAKER_13]: She was the one that got all this fucking
shit happening.
[SPEAKER_13]: The tax people, the cops, the special,
the special five gram rule.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time that's who did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're correct.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh well.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you got to remember, you know,
like there's the first time, second time I
[SPEAKER_21]: was over in Amsterdam, five grams meant
nothing to me.
[SPEAKER_21]: Every coffee shop I went in, I walked out
with five grams.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like back at the hotel that night,
I had about 50 grams on the bed.
[SPEAKER_21]: Go to leave, you know, the airport,
you're rolling 20 gram joints with five,
[SPEAKER_21]: six grams of hash in it, chief and down on
the way to central station.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause you bought too much for the trip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Airport joints.
[SPEAKER_13]: There used to be a coffee shop years ago,
like a little one.
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't sell it, but you could consume
cannabis in the airport.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did it one time and I was like,
this is fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like this is in the airport happened like,
I think in like 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I never saw it again.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was still there at the place and you
can smoke cigarettes, but you can smoke
[SPEAKER_13]: joints anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you could go there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And smoke your, your last joint was like,
when I still smoke joints this 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, I remember that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was run by the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just trying to help you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please see your passport.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sick roads.
[SPEAKER_13]: He patented it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Tony, are you back at the place
there, buddy?
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw, I saw the, the, I saw the table and
the bong.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm telling you people, I was up till one
or two in the morning and I got up at like
[SPEAKER_13]: six in the morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I got four hours sleep.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was worth it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause we're, you know, away here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just Columbia in the mountains and
the trees.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's very, very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad we made it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the high integrity glass arts always
quality to come visit, press up this hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be good, but I'm still very,
very, very tired.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I think I just got a message from Flav
to saying, uh, I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did high integrity bring any beauties?
[SPEAKER_21]: Any of that mothership elites over?
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, he gets those mothership elites
from, from high integrity.
[SPEAKER_13]: This I'm at high integrity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: That shit's all in storage safe where it
belongs, but he has a nice, he always has
[SPEAKER_13]: an incredible personal piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even that little, even that little,
uh, egg, that's a super small little egg,
[SPEAKER_13]: dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tony.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's looking pimpety pimp.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like the, the lure wallpaper,
the cigar aficionado place.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is like, this is like melting point.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is like dab, but definitely like,
you know, kind of like for a cigar type
[SPEAKER_13]: aficionado, but really not for cigar
aficionados at all for resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Aficionados for people who want to have a
beautiful space to share vibe out,
[SPEAKER_13]: have their nice pipe and not be worried
about it getting broken or stolen and
[SPEAKER_13]: just, uh, have a great session.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big TV up on the walls there.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: That bar Tony's like holding it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nobody in the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's just like, yeah, we're going to hold
it down here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to just hit my pen.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just goes to the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't even have a rig.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just pulls out the pen.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, yeah, so, uh, yeah,
it's just a pull press pull.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clear domes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm telling you good timing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got the piece, plug it in, plug it in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Man, there's a lot of stuff these days
that we need to have with us when we go
[SPEAKER_13]: and we travel to the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know any cannabis, uh, well,
resin aficionado in particular concentrate
[SPEAKER_13]: user can relate to this getting to the dab
bar, pulling out the gear.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got the Peli, you got all your hash,
you got your dab mat, you got your toker
[SPEAKER_13]: poker or your little dabber tool.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got your Q-tips and your DC glass
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got your, you know, your D nail,
you got your nail.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got, Oh, where's my whip?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I can't find my whip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I not bring the whip?
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you forget the one thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just like, Oh my God,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have some really,
really, really great thing to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, everything else you can get from your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Roberts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're, uh, you're hitting their
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_13]: I meant to say that as well at 10.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Matt Roberts, I met him in,
uh, in Amsterdam at the cannabis cup there
[SPEAKER_13]: when we were one of the last years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually also where I met Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's all full already too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't realize that one that he was
going to show was the full cartridge.
[SPEAKER_13]: It always looks crazy to open the box just
to be able to sell those full of oil is
[SPEAKER_13]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I think it's a half a gram in each
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like the good chunk is Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Terp rich.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just say hitting some master Kush
butter says Andrew NLD.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chazzy Chaz buy them full.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish we could sell those all over the
world like that, where you could just buy
[SPEAKER_13]: that and just be like, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's got the stash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we, so do we don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hopefully everything worked out with
Natasha.
[SPEAKER_13]: She said she was having some issues
earlier.
[SPEAKER_13]: When is that coming out at Harbor side?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know when that's coming out at
Harbor side?
[SPEAKER_13]: Tony, when, when are we releasing these
things?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice tough and puffing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little loud here.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to release these things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that what you said?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to know when they're releasing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe type it and I'll, I'll say it out
loud.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want the music to get us like,
I don't, I can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't put copyrighted music on YouTube
where it gets even like five seconds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get hit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially if it's a popular song.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_19]: We turned it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: If he's playing mainstream music,
it doesn't matter how quiet it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just matters that if YouTube picks it
up and it's copyrighted, this has church
[SPEAKER_13]: will, will they'll mute this.
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll mute our words.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll just be silent.
[SPEAKER_13]: They did it to my great gardener video.
[SPEAKER_19]: I used to, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I can't.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is like big band, jazzy like,
well, I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've already done it long enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, you might, we might as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just depends if the song changes and it
turns into like Mariah Carey or some like
[SPEAKER_13]: super mainstream thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just put a lot of energy into these
hashtags.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things is very important for us
not to have background music that is
[SPEAKER_13]: copyrighted.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll answer it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll answer it quickly then.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to spend another six hours
just puffing on them perfectly.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to release them for at
least six more months.
[SPEAKER_19]: So listen, this is what's going on real
quick.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, the lemon remedy was the first one to
get going because it's really special one.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, that was, that was on small
batches.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we're, we're gearing up for a
giant strawberry banana goo release.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the reason why we're holding back is
to be able to make sure that there's
[SPEAKER_19]: enough to go around to where it's not one
of those things where you put it out there
[SPEAKER_19]: and people like, Oh yeah, I got one of
those hundred.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, this has got to be a real,
like a real launch with, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, the ability to be able to get refills
and tanks and, and pre-filled kits and the
[SPEAKER_19]: whole nine yards, you know?
[SPEAKER_19]: So, and you don't just want one variety.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to lead off with,
uh, some Bay area cookies and,
[SPEAKER_19]: um, strawberry banana goo.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to have two flavors that
people can get to right away.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, then we'll have all kinds of
spin-offs, but the website and the
[SPEAKER_19]: information and everything that's going
into it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just takes a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I'd rather it be done right then,
then release stuff without all the
[SPEAKER_19]: information that's done, done in sequence,
you know?
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would say Friday of next week,
start to see some, I would hope that,
[SPEAKER_19]: that BPG and, uh, some of our friends at
the Harbor side and maybe Barbary coast
[SPEAKER_19]: would be the first to get them,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Friday of next week, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the long and short of it right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm crazy tested.
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, what, what should I get it tested for?
[SPEAKER_21]: I know potency doesn't matter,
but what would, uh, be some useful
[SPEAKER_21]: information for you guys?
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you say there, Chimera?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're still around?
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm just standing out.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's wondering what he should test his,
uh, purple.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pass four.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if you were taking that into a lab,
what would you want to find out about it?
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you be looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want to get a terpene profile
for sure.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, you need to do all those basic
tests.
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that you'd probably to be
directing, to try and figure out what the
[SPEAKER_24]: color is.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd be looking at some kind of anthocyanin
screen.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, there's a chemist, I can't remember
his name right now.
[SPEAKER_24]: I met him at ICRS, but he was working with
the group, Mary's Metables.
[SPEAKER_24]: If you get in touch with Mary's Metables,
there's a chemist there named Jessica
[SPEAKER_24]: Reedy, and she can put you in touch with
this guy who was doing a whole series of
[SPEAKER_24]: screens for different anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that's probably what I'd be
looking at first because I think,
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, it makes the most sense that
that's probably what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to figure it out and it's in
cannabis, you could send it to discover64.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a lab in Fort Collins and they
have all the sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it's an anthocyanin or not,
they'll tell you exactly to a nut's
[SPEAKER_01]: eyebrow, everything that's in your
extract, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs a little bit of money to do that
though.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I'll probably send a sample off
downstate this week and get it at least a
[SPEAKER_21]: terp profile on it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: And a terp content, uh, in my eyes,
it's over seven, six, seven percent terps
[SPEAKER_21]: guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_21]: So see what it comes out at with flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do a terpene profile at a
laboratory that's, you know, known for
[SPEAKER_01]: doing terpene profiles and be able to get
some kind of reproducibility, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of being able to, you know,
not just hang your hat on one piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could send it to a couple of
different labs and kind of get an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the terpene profile is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that, again, the,
um, uh, essence is itself, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes could essentially make color
components and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: anthocyanins, but the change with pH is
indicative of things like flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flavonoids all have open hydroxylic
groups and these hydroxylic groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the pH, could be ionized to
the phenoxide ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often because of the conjugation in
these molecules, they are highly colored
[SPEAKER_01]: and like a pH indicator at a particular
pH, all of a sudden they'll go from either
[SPEAKER_01]: being yellow, colorless to typically red.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of flavonoids are red in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I saw the, um, the micrograph that,
um, uh, uh, Ryan was showing earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: those look more reddish on the reddish
purple side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would tend to think that those are
due to flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to remember too, that
flavonoids have what's called a high
[SPEAKER_01]: extinction coefficient, which means that a
very, very small amount of material can
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to a very intense color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a dye molecule, think of like a
food coloring, you know, you take one drop
[SPEAKER_01]: of food coloring and it colors an entire
gallon of water because those in the dye
[SPEAKER_01]: have very, very high extinction
coefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of the highly colored
components in cannabis also are high
[SPEAKER_01]: extinction coefficient, and especially
those that emit out towards the blue and
[SPEAKER_01]: the purple colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would think that again,
maybe not so much anthocyanins,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it could just be some particular
combination of terpenes that is given rise
[SPEAKER_01]: to the color such that if you actually
separated it out, um, uh, uh, it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you could actually observe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, here's another thing that you can
do at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a paper chromatography
experiment where you take a little thin
[SPEAKER_01]: strip of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be useful if it were just something
like not bleached or not any way
[SPEAKER_01]: chemically treated, but you can take the
paper and dip it in the terpene solution
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it absorbs up the paper,
you'll sometimes be able to separate out
[SPEAKER_01]: the different color components.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are different color components
that are giving the overall color of
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what gives purple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that would be blue and red,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you'll end up separating out a
blue band and a red band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's giving the rise to the,
to the purple and color.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, for a science experiment,
for those of you who have kids who need a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a cool science experiment to do,
you can do that with flavored Kool-Aids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take it all the different
flavors of Kool-Aids and basically do
[SPEAKER_01]: paper chromatography to separate out the
different pigments and different colored
[SPEAKER_01]: Kool-Aids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cool little science experiment to
do with your kids, to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatography as a way to separating out
different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the other thing that you could
do with this stuff immediately is if you
[SPEAKER_01]: get the cannabinoid and the terpene
profile, come back to us on HashChurch and
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see what that data looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the cannabinoids account for,
you know, I don't know, 85% of the hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: 90%, you know, what, what kind of potency
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the terpenes account for say another
13%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you're basically accounting for
most of the material and you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting this color as a bulk property of
putting all those things together,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of which have color in and of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the cannabinoids are
colorless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as I know it, most of the
terpenes are colorless, although some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them are yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are actually colorless
liquids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But terpenes can be colored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so certainly like, you know,
acetylene, which has a very, very metallic
[SPEAKER_01]: blue kind of color to it, could be
something that's giving rise to the
[SPEAKER_01]: purplish hue here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, then there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I've made a lot of water hash in
my day and I've never run across a strain
[SPEAKER_21]: like this.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've made purplish hash, but nothing like
this with this terp profile, the flavor.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just on point on another level and
I'm kind of switching my whole garden over
[SPEAKER_21]: to about four strains that have these
crazy solventless, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this came out of a water hash process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you ever tried to do any other
extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still see the same color in other
types of extraction?
[SPEAKER_21]: I've done a BHO extraction with it and it
doesn't come out that color.
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't come out that gold,
yellow color.
[SPEAKER_22]: It does come out like a darker maroon gold
color.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then flower rosin will come out early
purple, but if I do a cured flower,
[SPEAKER_22]: it won't come out purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that tells my chemical intuition
that it's an anthocyanin that's giving
[SPEAKER_01]: rise to that color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're only seeing that in a water
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right again?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, dry stiff too as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say that that's anthocyanin
for that slitch because you would see the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue and you would see the azulene in the
BHO extract, but maybe it's there in just
[SPEAKER_01]: such small quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What color is the BHO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it any unusual color?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything usually that gets processed
comes out like that real light yellow
[SPEAKER_21]: gold, that real light one, and this is the
only strain that's random.
[SPEAKER_21]: And by this extractor, his method that
comes out different color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say it's purple, but- Have you
ever gotten the terpene profile like on
[SPEAKER_01]: your BHO extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'd be interesting to compare the
terpene profile and your BHO to the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will bet you based on you're not
seeing the blue color in your
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent-based butane extract, but you're
seeing it in the water, I'll bet you it's
[SPEAKER_01]: anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anthocyanin pigment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a clue that based on
what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be something that's again in
there in such a minor, minor small
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of a 10th of a percent,
but it's something that's extremely highly
[SPEAKER_01]: colored.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it casts a shadow over the entire bulk
of the material, but being there at such
[SPEAKER_01]: small quantity, it may be something that,
again, you need highly sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumentation like mass spec to figure
out what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like what I would do if,
so if we were sending this to discover 64,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first thing that they would do is
they'd run an NMR and we'd actually want
[SPEAKER_01]: to extract out the THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is always what I've said about
looking at the, I was gonna say the Virgin
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary, not the Virgin Mary.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that for?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mona Lisa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, looking at the painting of the Mona
Lisa across the street, you can see it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Mona Lisa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get the THC out of there's THCA
and look at all of the other components in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and those are the other components
that are probably giving the material
[SPEAKER_01]: color itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so first we would do a multi nuclear
NMR, carbon and proton, look for what else
[SPEAKER_01]: is in there and then throw that thing into
an LC mass spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these two tests probably cost maybe
about four or $500 combined together and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you hire someone like me to help you
interpret the data and we can exactly tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you to the nth degree of everything that's
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is something that we were
supposed to do with the green terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones from Indra, but he sort of did
not follow through on providing a sample
[SPEAKER_01]: or pushing the project forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until those samples are submitted,
we will never know what's in Indra's
[SPEAKER_01]: famous green terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for anyone who's more lab to determine
an unknown in a cannabis extract like
[SPEAKER_01]: this, like holy shit, what's in there,
send it to discover 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you exactly what's in there
and you can publish the results.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: When I start with the material,
you see the flower, it's purple,
[SPEAKER_21]: it's all fresh frozen, it's dark purple.
[SPEAKER_21]: And as I wash it, the purple leaves the
flower.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's going out in my excess water and
then when the material's done,
[SPEAKER_21]: it isn't purple no more, it's green,
but then the heads are still purple.
[SPEAKER_21]: The heads don't wash away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that again, it might be in
such a small, minute quantity that you
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't normally be able to measure it at
a normal lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Discovery 64, they'll be able to tell you
exactly what's in there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have to say that this has been a
wonderful three hours chilling with all of
[SPEAKER_13]: you, but I still have a video to post or
to film here and we've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_13]: hundred grams of hash to press out.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to make that happen,
make a little bit of oil, get some video
[SPEAKER_13]: footage for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: But thanks Minnesota Dabs for coming in
and talking anthocyanin and other
[SPEAKER_13]: potentials.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever's in your purple resin,
it'll be interesting to follow up with it
[SPEAKER_13]: and see what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Always a pleasure, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for filling us in and educating us
with the chemistry behind things,
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as Chimera, always coming in with
cool papers and unique cutting edge
[SPEAKER_13]: information.
[SPEAKER_13]: Etienne and Skunkman Sam, always a
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B and Darren have split already
D420K, so thank them for coming in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Tony for coming in and showing
us the cool vape bar and those Trinity
[SPEAKER_13]: pens.
[SPEAKER_13]: And anyone that I'm forgetting,
shit, sorry if I'm forgetting you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks to High Integrity Glass Art for
hosting Hash Church here at his place
[SPEAKER_13]: today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And thanks for Sasquatch for bringing the
M1 and pressing out some resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see you guys all next week.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace out everybody.
