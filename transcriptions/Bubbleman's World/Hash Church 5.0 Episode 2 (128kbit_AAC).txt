[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, I guess it went live on the
other page, so I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: A Hash Church 5.0, episode two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going through the logistics of trying
to get it all to work here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're live in the other room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are starting to come over now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we got Wade waiting to get in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Wade and Skunk Man Sam in the room
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of elders.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I think that is all.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Wade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Skunk Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's to another episode of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy, Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed you last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Sam was missed us last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was ready, but he wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it happens like that with Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Started 81 seconds ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already got 53 people in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was me playing what you said on
TV.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to watch it on TV because it's
bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a nice pretty big screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Wade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got the coveralls on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we're having a good Sunday today
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty stormy here last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably like 85 degrees Fahrenheit all
day, sunny, no clouds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last night it was like just wind
and not so much rain, but there is a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of cleanup to do on the property,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty uneventful evening, Saturday night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty chill myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hung out with my little guy,
Tanner.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be turning 10 years old in a
few days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm taking him to his first concert in
two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: To Michael Francie and Spearhead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Michael Francie because he does all
ages shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, Rackham.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have, well, Dr. Mark just came in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Gunsman Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Wade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invited Colin from Vessel Life Sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just visiting his father in the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he'll be here a little bit late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thomas from Grandmaster LED will be in.
[SPEAKER_04]: In about 10 minutes late as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I didn't hear from Dr.
Mark Lewis or Alex Dixon from SC Labs or
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick Ziegler.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also put the invitation out to those
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invited Mojave again if he was able to
make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of lose whoever is able to
make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have our little conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And spend a couple hours together for Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus, how are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Sam, you missed your last week?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you look the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's still got his COVID mask there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost other people are, our yellow hairs
are turning white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Wade, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent yesterday, Monica and I made a big
exhibition and went down through the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: Area for the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still trying to, still doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, the California market,
the business side of it is pretty bare
[SPEAKER_00]: bones at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was lovely to see a bunch of people
that I knew, a bunch of people stopped by.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, lots and lots of people are
realizing that the California market as
[SPEAKER_00]: it's currently structured is a big raster
and are dropping out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a shame to see some of
the legacy operators that I know who are
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary cultivators and briefly
compassionate medicine makers that really
[SPEAKER_00]: just there's no way in the business world
to make it in California right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks to me, unless you're willing to
stretch the rules or ignore them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole different conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it was a really lovely day for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a lot out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty exhausted today, but I'm really
looking forward to our conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the brilliant people who show up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, shout out to Tim Blake for 20 plus
years now of the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about that the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He must have started that just right
around when we started Legends of Hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, because it's been 20 to 21 years of
Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so kind of neat that those two
legends of Hash was 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we had the balloons?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the balloon was the first
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hard to remember shit as you get
older.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do definitely remember the balloon
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there the balloon year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that was a couple of years
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you're right in the sense that
the first one we did was either an 02 or
[SPEAKER_04]: 03, which would put us just around 21,
22 years of doing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saved an extra balloon if you need one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I never got a balloon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a neat kind of way to get a
ticket to just someone like, let's just
[SPEAKER_04]: put the ticket on the balloon.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have the balloon, you can come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have the balloon,
well, I'm sure would probably still let
[SPEAKER_04]: you in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, crazy, crazy times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just checking out the chat room.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got 132 people watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had up to about 220 live last week,
usually around 10 o'clock when people are
[SPEAKER_04]: getting up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got John Maddux, who's always in
the chat room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, huge supporter.
[SPEAKER_04]: RackhumsRosen is in the chat room right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got KeepitSimple420.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that were wondering about
the German numbers that we were discussing
[SPEAKER_04]: last week, KeepitSimple actually put it in
the comments section regarding how many
[SPEAKER_04]: members you can have, how much you can
grow, the sort of breakdown for that
[SPEAKER_04]: German model that they're doing,
similar to Spain, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was nice of him to put in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Cody Packer, OGbrick420,
Al Telescope Uranus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: TK Brewer's in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, just a ton of cool people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's growing as we speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we'll have a few more people
joining us here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, I think it might be time
for a little rip out of the Carta.
[SPEAKER_04]: Loving this little guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, my puffco is... Oh,
no, actually, I wonder if it started
[SPEAKER_04]: working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to hit my puffco the other
day and it was doing the red light thing
[SPEAKER_04]: where it wasn't heating up and always
nerve wracking when your little electric
[SPEAKER_04]: devices stop working.
[SPEAKER_04]: But oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the base and everything,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have a little rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the dialogue going.
[SPEAKER_04]: No fish for you, Dr. Mark, or don't they
have some huge fucking festival going on
[SPEAKER_04]: right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been seeing little clips on my
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are having a festival down in the
hole right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the secret set and it looked like it
was at the Sphere or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really stepped it up with those
visuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't but help.
[SPEAKER_04]: The work they did at the Sphere must have
helped inspire that, you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it looked really crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw some clips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty amazing, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I saw the interview with Trey when
he was talking about the Sphere shows that
[SPEAKER_04]: they were going to do and how serious they
were taking it and how they were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: no one is ever going to see anything like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dead and Co had a pretty incredible
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same graphics every night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fish went out on a limb and we're like,
we're going to just do new graphics every
[SPEAKER_04]: minute of every night, which sounds about
right, Fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty incredible stuff
to behold, even all the Dead and Company
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They show neighborhoods in San Francisco
and venues where they've played.
[SPEAKER_04]: The neighborhood in San Francisco with the
drone, where it all lifts up and they go
[SPEAKER_04]: up, that was absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, of course, did not make it to the
Sphere for any of the shows, but I've had
[SPEAKER_04]: many friends go.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend Allison has been to,
I don't even know how many of the shows,
[SPEAKER_04]: so she sends me little videos and stuff
where I get to live vicariously through
[SPEAKER_04]: her.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you saw that guy who posted his
bong hit that he took on Instagram,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the people who run the Sphere are
the same people who run Madison Square
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Dolan family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they use facial recognition software,
as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go to Madison Square Garden,
you go to any of their venues,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll actually use facial recognition to
say, hey, was this guy ever a problem at a
[SPEAKER_03]: previous event?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if so, they'll pull you out of
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, originally, I think he got
banned from those venues, but then there
[SPEAKER_03]: was such a public outlashes for the bong
rip dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got to think a lot of bad shit
happens at concerts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some aggressive people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But taking a bong rip at a concert would
be, especially one like Fish at the
[SPEAKER_04]: Sphere, where bong rips have been involved
in the creation of the entire music,
[SPEAKER_04]: the visuals, probably the building of the
Sphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think bong rips were present all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what a silly thing to kind of...
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, they have a pretty strict
policy of no smoking in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's trying to keep tobacco and
all that kind of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people are still hitting vape pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess the point of having actually
fire and combustion inside an event where
[SPEAKER_03]: you have some big glass bong, it's kind of
like, okay, you snuck the bong in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're smoking, you're recording it,
you're putting it up to the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how are you not going to get in
trouble?
[SPEAKER_04]: I still support it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Civil disobedience, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Wade was saying earlier with the
disaster that is the California legal
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis scene, unless you're willing to
stretch or break the rules, which is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: wow, isn't that how we got the rules in
the first place?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know it is here in Canada for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just like civil disobedience all day
long, took them to court, won,
[SPEAKER_04]: gained this whole scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now all the people that are involved
in it, because they have like the licenses
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're trying to protect,
are terrified to step out of line and
[SPEAKER_04]: practice any more civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of a weird little corner
we've painted ourselves into with this
[SPEAKER_04]: legal license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, I went to see Burning Spear at
the Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, you cannot smoke inside
the building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, no puffing at Burning Spear at
the Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, it'll be like, we really don't want
you dancing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you could just take your,
just don't dance, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: No dancing, no puffing, no enjoying
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a reggae concert, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to puff and we're
going to have to dance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burning Spear must be like close to 80
years old now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: He is fucking old and he's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so good to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the videos that your wife put up,
some of the video and some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he looked like he did like 30 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just super active.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just like, you know, he's got that,
I don't know what it is, but another guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaican that has that is Kidis Eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also got to be approaching 80 now.
[SPEAKER_04]: In his seventies, I got to hang out with
him quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've just, I've never seen like a
stronger 70, like just inspirational in
[SPEAKER_04]: the sense of how strong he was and how,
you know, one night we were walking in
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingston and in the city and there was
this sort of, I don't know, like a three
[SPEAKER_04]: or a four foot ledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, I was like, I'm going to
jump onto this ledge and we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: walking, me and Kidis and some other
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I jumped up onto this ledge and I
looked behind me and, and Kidis is jumping
[SPEAKER_04]: onto the ledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, his foot slips off the ledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: He fucking falls so hard, smashes himself
so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was just like, Oh my God,
like he's going to be dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's, we're going to be going to the
hospital right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He shook that shit off, came to the
concert with us that we were walking to,
[SPEAKER_04]: hung out and danced and puffed all night
and had like a little bump on his forehead
[SPEAKER_04]: from where he smacked his head when he
fell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise I was just like,
Tony was actually there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even Tony said, I would have been in
the hospital for a month because he was
[SPEAKER_04]: behind Kidis watching him fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just a truly a testament to the
strength of the Jamaican people and how
[SPEAKER_04]: hard they work.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something to be said for that and
how active they stay as they get older
[SPEAKER_04]: because holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if he did get all mashed up,
he could have just joined Israel
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's some low brow humor,
but you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time, the first time I saw
Israel Vibrations and I guess it was
[SPEAKER_04]: Scully and Whiff who both had Polio who
have the canes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Apple was the dude that did not
have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they came out and were dancing on
these canes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty inspirational to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really was blown away at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Colin's just hitting me up like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he says he's in the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see anyone in the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's in the waiting room of a
different room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see if we can figure out sending
him the link to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much thinking, too much thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone else talk while I do some work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Wade, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, probably the most exciting thing
that's going on these days for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, is I came across a paper that was
published in a journal called Biofactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about it a little bit last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, a group of researchers took
three different multiple myeloma cell
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and tested the efficacy of minor
cytokinibinoids against those multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: myeloma cell lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fascinating thing is it turns out
that CBG, as in George or golf,
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBN, as in Nancy, are both remarkably
effective at suppressing the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple myeloma, at least these three
multiple myeloma cells, cell lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the right dose seems to trigger
cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always been fascinating to me how
is it I'm dealing with cancer given the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cannabis that I consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that at least for one
possibility is I don't usually consume
[SPEAKER_00]: much CBG or CBN in my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's likely that I'm missing out on
that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've since secured a bunch of CBG oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes in at about 52% CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working on sourcing some CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit of it delivered to me
yesterday at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And per Mark Seldon's suggestion last
week, I'm working on finding some
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers who are willing to do a
special batch of oil for me based on your
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation, Mark, of heat,
oxygen, and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got for the moment,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to feel like I can get on
board with personal experience of handling
[SPEAKER_00]: and perhaps even controlling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cancer that is eating up my bones with
the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an cannabis advocate and a patient
advocate for hell going on 20 some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I would love to be able to talk
about my own personal example in this
[SPEAKER_00]: realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's the news from Nevada
County, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much love and really appreciate you
calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome aboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wish all the best for you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care a lot.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to be here again with you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely to see Mark and Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And David, awesome to see the cat in the
hat again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wade, I've been dealing with a family
member who has Parkinson's and we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: through the gamut of cannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have in the past decade,
we've been dealing with around 13 years
[SPEAKER_02]: now as a family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing a lot of success with CBN
for pain management, which is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much with sleep, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I found with CBN as it gets you to
sleep, it doesn't help you stay asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need other constituents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was part of the work I did with
terpene formulation to have other
[SPEAKER_02]: constituents help you stay asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that's another avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Mark can speak on the chemistry of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I worked with a toxicologist to really
better understand how our body is
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with terpenes and the best way
to approach it in terms of percentage
[SPEAKER_02]: points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot more to be uncovered
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was one thing that I spent the
last 18 months just doing that type of
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been really eye opening to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Mark, if you've seen
anything that's compelling on your end in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the chemistry of how these
constituents are coming together and how
[SPEAKER_02]: they interact with one another or coexist
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what I do know, I think since the
last time we've talked about this on
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashchurch anyway, is that there's now
published work in peer reviewed journal on
[SPEAKER_03]: a double blind placebo for CBN and sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always sort of anecdotal and sort
of suggested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there was a study,
a Japanese study from like, I want to say
[SPEAKER_03]: the 70s or the 80s, where they were
looking at CBN analogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they looked in a sleep model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was always interpreted as these
things were, you know, had collagen,
[SPEAKER_03]: like chlorine and fluorine and bromine and
stuff like that, decorating the rings of
[SPEAKER_03]: the molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these weren't natural compounds at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they just looked at like how it made
these mice behave in a sleep study,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it wasn't a so-called sleep study.
[SPEAKER_03]: The study that just came out, I think it
was it came out earlier this spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the data is pretty compelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even at low dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I guess there is an effect
on CBN, like you said, of CBD and the
[SPEAKER_03]: other cannabinoids are in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if I remember the efficacy
from the study correctly, it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that were full spectrum oils
were more effective than the isolates on
[SPEAKER_03]: their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just attribute that to,
yeah, there's just something else in the
[SPEAKER_03]: mix that's making this stuff work more
effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really understand what it is,
but yeah, it's good to know that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what was always sort of
suspected anecdotally, that there's now
[SPEAKER_03]: published double blind evidence to prove
what we in the cannabis community knew a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is that CBN is good for sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it's it's also, you know,
I think there's more to be uncovered in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the pain management aspect of
that compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like there is some something
there based on not just my own,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I have two herniated discs.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, I have one of my my neck and
then I have a tear in my thumb.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I take large amounts of it,
my thumb feels normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's, you know,
and Mark, you can dispel maybe that's
[SPEAKER_02]: placebo or maybe that's, you know,
but I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know, thousands of times high
dose of that same molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, there's an anti-inflammatory
effect that's sort of peripheral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it could just it could just be that
kind of like the way that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you feel a headache coming on and you
take some ibuprofen and all of a sudden no
[SPEAKER_03]: more headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's super interesting here,
Colin, is that there's a company called
[SPEAKER_03]: InMed, which is actually taking CBN
through, I think, phase three clinical
[SPEAKER_03]: trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I want to say it's for
Alzheimer's, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's maybe that's another study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might be a different molecule
because they have a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a proprietary code.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's CBN or a CBN derivative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, could these things
actually be like the pharmaceuticals in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future, you know, enshrined by the
molecules in the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to have access to it,
like here's Wade, you know, I need CBN and
[SPEAKER_03]: I need CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should just be a formula that they
should already have available for you,
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically for this treatment,
dosed at the right level in the products
[SPEAKER_03]: that you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we already know that these
molecules are active and more importantly,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, you know, you're going to
die from taking these.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these medications that they use
to treat disease are themselves deadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you end up dying from is
the toxic effect from all these other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that cannabinoids aren't going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like there should actually be at
the pharmacy right now the three to one
[SPEAKER_03]: tincture that Wade needs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just making three to one up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the right ratio is,
but you should be able to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, these are both non THC cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not taking this to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get behind the wheel and
crash my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking this to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that not available?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is there not readily available?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that not readily available?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely stunted in the sense that
you would have thought 10 years ago when
[SPEAKER_04]: we were having these conversations further
down the line, it seems like medical was
[SPEAKER_04]: used as a shield to protect a lot of
recreational people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause and, and in their defense,
like you're living in a country where you
[SPEAKER_04]: are a pothead.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always want to have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You love to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You love to smoke cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You love to get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to, you know, want to protect
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: If some way of protection comes up,
especially if you're in a prohibitive
[SPEAKER_04]: country, that's like, you could get years
in prison or have like your life destroyed
[SPEAKER_04]: and all you're like, well, or you could go
get a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This doctor will get you a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like 50 bucks or 150 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And suddenly everyone's got these
licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed innocent enough, although I will
say it always left a little bit of a bad
[SPEAKER_04]: taste in my mouth from a patient
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why with hash church, I always loved
to showcase real patient perspectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, you know, I always hear Sam's
words as well in the sense that it's all a
[SPEAKER_04]: value, you know, someone who wants to get
high, someone who wants to use cannabis as
[SPEAKER_04]: a medicine, like everyone should be
allowed to have that totally agreed at the
[SPEAKER_04]: same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe that patients should probably
take precedence and not line up behind
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational users.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it is a little bit hard that,
um, yeah, I mean, here in Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoppers drug mart, all these big
companies got on, they were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to dispense it because we are
the people who dispense medicine in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And medical was this big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were paying huge for their licenses
and facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the minute recreational came in the
door, I would say 80 to 90% of the
[SPEAKER_04]: companies just like dropped right out of
the medical, um, uh, regulated,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, scene and just popped right into
recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the point where even shoppers drug
mart, I mean, that's part of blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah is a $55 billion company.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not doing cannabis in Canada
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, why would we try and
sell because cannabis just, it doesn't fit
[SPEAKER_04]: in the way they want it to fit in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, well, we want to
control it and sell it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, eventually, like we were talking
about last week, it's probably going to
[SPEAKER_04]: end up at gas stations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe it'll be that Delta eight,
maybe it'll be something different,
[SPEAKER_04]: but people are simple in their cannabis in
the sense that they want to get high and
[SPEAKER_04]: they want it to be inexpensive and they
want it to be convenient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even my own mother who was buying from
shoppers drug mart at one point was just
[SPEAKER_04]: like, this isn't, they don't have the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the options for me and
they run out of what I do need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And suddenly she ended up, you know,
going to, you know, uh, another sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: medical platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think eventually recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a bit of a bummer for the med
patients, how the recreational just use
[SPEAKER_04]: them as a platform to get to get to where,
where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good point you're bringing
up because, you know, here in the States,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, medical was a ploy to get the
recreational to then not have to pay your
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor that, you know, it's not blanket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone, you know, pharmacology has come
a long way in terms of understanding the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and where things are at,
but a lot of these people are just here
[SPEAKER_02]: for a cash grab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's a dichotomy here that
we have where we have us on legacy and
[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiast slash, you know, researchers
slash, you know, activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, you don't, you don't,
a lot of these things don't get brought
[SPEAKER_02]: into the world of, you know, of,
of called the corporate risk, corporate
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as regulations get instilled into
these, these markets, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not really a, um, a bunch of,
there's not a group of experts talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: the constituents around them to say,
Hey guys, these are the good rules and
[SPEAKER_02]: regs that allow this to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very much, they keep trying and
trying and trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, New York is a great example of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Ohio, you know, there's, there's a
lot, there's so many examples of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of this and medical for some reason is
at the backend of recreational,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's what got us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's, it's really interesting
how we're, you know, I think about what
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam did when he went to Europe to try to
figure out what his version of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of all this was, you know, I often think
about that and think about when you
[SPEAKER_02]: started, you and, and Rob, you know,
started your, your projects over there in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually moved over here because I knew
I could not continue in California and the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just were not going to let it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I honestly, like, I think it's weird to
say this to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you guys were on a, on this together,
but I think about that a lot when I try to
[SPEAKER_02]: now, as we navigate here in the States and
navigate even what's considered a mature,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't even even want to call
it a market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very infant and we really
don't, no one's got it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all have to come together to better
understand what the right path is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're talking about medical and
recreation, it's often so heavily weighed
[SPEAKER_02]: towards recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I start, I go back to one thing and I
keep thinking about patient access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the only real reason
that you don't have to go to a doctor to
[SPEAKER_02]: pay him under bucks to say, Hey,
can I go get an ather?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, that sounds off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that was kind of my comment
earlier about pharmacology and
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacophacology yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they're in suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, those individuals need to
understand the plant and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: constituents around it and what,
what truly matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then help push that forward,
you know, maybe ask better questions or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or problem solve in new ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as I look around the, you know,
where we've been and where we're going,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just a glaring open hole of
confusion as to what is therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we're, we're constantly
talking about pop culture within medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis hand over fist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's almost to the point where that's
what runs, you know, every single state,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's part of the problem is
that we don't really have consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: constituents that are fighting for
medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just fall into this like generalized
reward, you know, world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's really interesting to me
because I, you know, I, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have this license in New York state and
it's the rec license.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the individuals that I've
historically serviced have been medical
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's really interesting to
me how this has all kind of shifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, do you, now, Sam, do you think when
you went to Europe that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of medical was the only modality
that was in front of you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it, was there a glimpse of what
could come?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have worked on industrial hemp,
but you know, there's not as much joy in
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did work a little with industrial hemp,
but it was always a medical cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed you to explore the genetics,
the inheritance, the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my real, real interest in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, in America, I just plain could
not do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I got here, they approved me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people in the ministry of
health said cannabis is not a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a drug of abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, at least you have an
open mind on the subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's frightening that those,
you know, it's not like it was just some
[SPEAKER_04]: random sort of a little ignorant group
that was like, wow, we're afraid of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you could sit down with them and
be like, no, look, it's actually like a
[SPEAKER_04]: really good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they could be like, oh my God,
look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not, a lot of the people on
the other side of this aren't like that
[SPEAKER_04]: here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Health Canada still does not acknowledge
that cannabis is, has medical benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have like Health Canada,
that's like our FDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a legal medical platform that
services Canadians.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet they all have come out and quoted,
not all, every single person that works
[SPEAKER_04]: there, but the higher ups have come out
multiple times and quoted, we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: believe there's any medical value to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We beat them in court and we forced their
hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyone that's worried about civil
disobedience, yes, you can end up in
[SPEAKER_04]: court, but it can be some of the best
courts that you've ever ended up in,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially if the timing is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was here in Canada for all of the
people and there's too many to name,
[SPEAKER_04]: but obviously John Conroy sort of leading
the, the fights with so many wonderful
[SPEAKER_04]: people behind them that it was,
I went to some of those court cases and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was unbelievable to see the unraveling of
a system that had been in play for so
[SPEAKER_04]: long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to hear like, oh, it's going to,
to dissent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like dissent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, you know, it goes to the
queen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes to the Royal family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through this dissent process,
like, wow, like I'm Canadian.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even realize just how deeply
intertwined the Commonwealth, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada is, I mean, obviously she's on our
money, but it's beyond intertwined.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make decisions in, in, in London for
if something's going to become legal as a
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine in Canada, Canada was just at the
breaking point.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way anyone was going to put
it back in the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now after so many years, I see,
oh, they didn't need to put it in the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had this other plan where they would
just be like, wow, we'll just bring out
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational and then we'll just,
uh, you know, make sure that they can have
[SPEAKER_04]: the worst packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like these are two totally
different products in the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is the, the U S version of
this is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like just a much nicer
packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can't have any packaging here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have any, anything that really
makes you look too, too different.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it is just so similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even myself as a head, I'll walk into
one of these shops and I have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my brain doesn't want to connect that
this Mylar bag is gummies and this Mylar
[SPEAKER_04]: bag is traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this Mylar bag is, you know,
some bubble hash or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, come on, man, we can do
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you let us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, it's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say that because they're, you know,
Connecticut was a market that kind of took
[SPEAKER_02]: that stance in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple others that did that
Pennsylvania tried to, and then it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fell apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York took the stance and then it just
exploded.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it, you know, to your point,
yeah, we can do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's, there's not only from a
preservation perspective for the,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the actual material, cause you know,
chemistry is happening as it until you use
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it, it's not just that,
but also like the single use CPGs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we've fallen into the CPG world
for a product that is just so heavily
[SPEAKER_02]: guarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, well I talked to,
you know, even people that can't open the
[SPEAKER_02]: child, say this, rip the package and it's
just trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's, it's literally,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's really, you know,
it, it's an opportunity, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: for designers and young designers and
young engineer designers to come and make
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting, you know, artwork and
packaging that other, other people can
[SPEAKER_02]: grab onto and use at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sustainability is a big driving
force behind a lot of what I see around
[SPEAKER_02]: what we need, but there's really no
perfect, you know, material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause plastic so, it's so woven into the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's the oil is just, it's just the
backbone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to get away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then someone has to engineer a CPG,
a CR top that, that doesn't utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the, I think that's our biggest
system material.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what my partners do, Colin,
in DC here, my partners, Ted and Andy,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're CPG manufacturers from China.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They build machines and they're,
they're really good at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been helping us do a bunch of
different projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they've got this machine and it's
the old, it's the old tuna cans,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they have a ceramic, but it's ceramic
on the inside of the can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not even really, it's not touching
metal, but they have this crazy machine
[SPEAKER_04]: that seals these cans up and they're all
ceramic on the inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty wild to witness this thing go
to just for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know how many of you ever
saw weed in the tuna can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always one group that was doing it
in, in, some market, but here in BC back,
[SPEAKER_04]: they used to have the tuna cans and they,
the, the flour was called the tuna that
[SPEAKER_04]: went into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was like easy to ship,
moved around real good, preserved it
[SPEAKER_04]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could crack the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then obviously you would end up having
like a plastic top after that,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you wanted to make it reusable,
but kind of a cool concept probably could
[SPEAKER_04]: do with silicone top at this point in
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, not so easy to escape plastic
these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are wearing it on their
bodies, like all of those Lululemon pants
[SPEAKER_04]: and all of those yoga pants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all like forever chemicals leaching
into your body through basically like
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic woven materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's well said, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's, I've been going through it
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I've been working on
packaging and it's, there's just not a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of great solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to either spend a lot of money on
it or to be willing to get in line and
[SPEAKER_02]: just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even these, like I have these jars here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which are the pop backs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some blueberry banana in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's this, you know, this is a
plastic top with a metal piece here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks the air out of it and it keeps it
preserved, but you know, this is at the
[SPEAKER_02]: heart of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is glass with I'd say 70% of
materials that are going to break down
[SPEAKER_02]: over a long set point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a, it's an opportunity I
think for everyone around us to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause every single time someone,
you know, like blasts through these jars,
[SPEAKER_02]: like nothing, you know, boxes full of
empty jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think the biggest problem
we have is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, Mark, I wanted to ask
you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking at Aspergillus quite a
lot and I was starting to look at tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: not to change subjects here too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering, there's no evidence
whatsoever in tobacco that those dried
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves have been tested for Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your opinion or anyone's opinion
here, has anyone ever looked at this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm starting to look at it because
I'm starting to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we held to such a flame if things
around us or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are we doing to better understand
it and the actual constituents that are
[SPEAKER_02]: harmful versus this blanketed statement
that it's all harmful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel, I feel like certain
markets are being suppressed of great
[SPEAKER_02]: material based on unknowns that aren't
defined in testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so the question is what like is
tobacco tested for, for Aspergillus and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can it succumb?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is fungicides that are used to
treat Aspergillus on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, again, super
interesting to think about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what was required for that company to be
able to launch their products,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to be applied to tobacco,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause supposedly you have to show,
you know, low environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the use rates, you have to show,
you know, safety in all kinds of studies,
[SPEAKER_03]: including, you know, again, just efficacy,
safety studies on all the metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just really difficult,
I guess, to think about doing that for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, because they'd have to show all
that data on cannabis, which is schedule
[SPEAKER_03]: one, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a level playing field and
tobacco in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the nicotinamides and all those things,
those things are potent insecticides as
[SPEAKER_03]: they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a homemade, you know, little
recipe to control flying insects on the
[SPEAKER_03]: farm was always just take a little bit of
chewing tobacco, soak it in water,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then use that to spray down dumpsters
and shit like that, where you have flies
[SPEAKER_03]: in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, at the end of the day,
it's like a whole different thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: because as Marcus will tell you,
there's 10 other things and cigarettes
[SPEAKER_03]: that'll kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how do you determine whether or
not the application of a fungicide or any
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of pesticide to the crop has some
impact on human safety when the product
[SPEAKER_03]: itself is deadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's easy to know that radium 226
is very, very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been talking about it for 30 plus
years in the production of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it goes down really smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it goes down really smooth,
all right, while it's mutating all your
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's on Health Canada's website.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have radium 226.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the breakdown of polonium 210
and lead 210, which are kind of two of the
[SPEAKER_04]: many thousands of different things that
are created when you burn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they talk about that they are
radioactive nucleotides and that they
[SPEAKER_04]: mutate DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just couldn't believe that they
actually have that on a Health Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: website, because for the last 35 years,
David Malmolavine has written extensive
[SPEAKER_04]: articles on the use of radium 226 in the
production of tobacco and how very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very bad it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had to get rid of one, that would
be a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be a really good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I bring it up, Marcus and Mark
and everyone else, I feel like there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of... Teravera is a product out there
that people have used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bacteria that eats the aspergillus,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know enough about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never used the product, although we
have spoken to four or five farmers that
[SPEAKER_02]: have sworn by this product and said that
this is what works for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just am weary of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm weary of the idea of this product
works, Teravera, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fungus?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should do some research before
I blurt out what it is, because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly know what it's made of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've spoken to a bunch of growers
that are in New York and other states that
[SPEAKER_02]: have been growing outdoors and they swear
by this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say that they're able to pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ask the labs to plate their material
rather than just run the normal way that
[SPEAKER_02]: they run the samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm after is everyone's opinion on
this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we approach this as we move
forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me understand for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a nutrient?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, you spray on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you put it a part of your IPM
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a hash maker, I'm extremely weary of
anyone that tells me that they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we get in there and put this on our
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to come out fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resin is going to be great because
usually the resin is not great and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated and nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I think for just the
general conversation to research and look
[SPEAKER_02]: into, but I do think it's an ongoing
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone I speak to in Oregon is dealing
with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone I speak to on the East Coast is
dealing with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just need to problem-solve and
start talking to each other about what the
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions are, if there are any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to start looking at certain
pools?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it this product that I'm mentioning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it something else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to go back to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go there for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that they're testing now,
which is for PCR, they're just basically
[SPEAKER_03]: finding the DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't tell you that the fungus is
alive and well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, I think this was maybe 2019 or
maybe 2020, right before the pandemic,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were looking at all of these failures
for Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have crops and all of them were
actually grown organically and some of
[SPEAKER_03]: them on Amish farms in the New York,
Pennsylvania, Maryland area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell you the material itself
looked proper, but we wondered again,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're like, oh, look at these hits for
Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does actually this mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, yeah, it's after the fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't actually mean that Aspergillus
is alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just meant at some point in time during
that plant sample life, Aspergillus lived
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to better understand and define at
what point is it harmful and is it
[SPEAKER_02]: harmful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because yeah, I get on there's certain
patients or certain consumers that have
[SPEAKER_02]: autoimmune disease, so they're at risk,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But have we actually proven that they are
at risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why are we taking whole lots of
material and saying, yo, this isn't fit?
[SPEAKER_02]: For human consumption based on this small
window of information that we quite
[SPEAKER_02]: frankly don't understand, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm kind of asking is
like, well, is there a better way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there has to be a better way is
what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there's got to be some people
together that can figure out the right
[SPEAKER_02]: rules and regs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on top of that, the right
protocols and right IPM to manage the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cultivation aspect, because all of
it has to work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to remember that Aspergillus is
found in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're growing outdoors,
if they can't find a spore of Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plants, it's probably because they
haven't looked hard enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it just begs the question,
are we going too far on the parts per
[SPEAKER_02]: million?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bring it real back outside the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all been growing before any of these
data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of this is what we understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I've smoked moldy cannabis in my
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know all of us have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We seem to be OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there's a threshold of whether or
not it's healthy or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand you're not supposed to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a small window and a
possibility that at certain times you're
[SPEAKER_02]: ingesting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the narrative or the theme
here, at what point, what is the parts per
[SPEAKER_02]: million?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think about this a lot,
because there's huge lots of material that
[SPEAKER_02]: you just can't work with because it's just
failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it has to go through this
remediation process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I realize, I wonder if that
remediation, that radiation process,
[SPEAKER_02]: which then goes back into someone's body,
how does that, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going through radiation and then we
have dead material now sitting on organic
[SPEAKER_02]: material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just kind of drum up the thought
process from Mark and others that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten ourselves into sort of this weird
dichotomy where we're like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, OK, you can actually smoke it
because it's dead now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're ruining the material in the
experience for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden people think this
is what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to bring that up,
because it's something we're all dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with right now today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that's not what good herb is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we live in a microbial world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, without microbes,
I don't think the plant would exist as we
[SPEAKER_03]: know it today, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the plant doesn't fix nitrogen,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But the microbes in the soil do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs nitrogen for amino acids and
proteins and those enzymes, all those
[SPEAKER_03]: synthases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are made of nitrogen and amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to go back to something you were
saying earlier, I mean, it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: have we gone too far?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just in terms of analytical
instrumentation, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have the ability to see down to the
part per trillion level is amazing,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is like space age kind of
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're applying that to cannabis or
any agriculturally produced product,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to find all kinds of shit in
there, just because it's in there doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: mean it's dangerous at the level that it's
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, like, we were looking,
Richard Rose, a couple weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: made reference to something that was
posted on LinkedIn, about a Japanese
[SPEAKER_03]: referendum that they were trying to push
forward where they were going to legalize
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD, but it had to be able to be shown to
be point, let me get this right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, one, two, three,
four, one percent or less THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of analytical chemists,
yeah, we're like looking at this going,
[SPEAKER_03]: my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something that's point, okay,
let me count one, two, three, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, oh, two would fail or even three or
four zero point oh, oh, oh, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: two.
[SPEAKER_03]: would fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, how are you going to
distinguish between something that's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just a hair over such a spot?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, in the noise of the data,
it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it basically you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, like, in provision,
I don't know if it's I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, what do you think, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, even like when mishulam
data, like most like what he was doing is
[SPEAKER_03]: he was looking at the different compounds
that were in the plant, he was able to
[SPEAKER_03]: look down at say, point oh, one percent,
but to be able to get down to point oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, oh, oh, one percent is not only an
analytical challenge, it's just it's
[SPEAKER_03]: ridiculous to think that you'd be able to
commercially like test at that level and
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to determine a winner from a
loser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dredd, Dredd is in the chat right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew for DNA for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a really exceptional indoor
grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying that in Illinois right now,
the CFU limits are 1000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to give you an idea, Michigan is
100,000 for the same test.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything's failing in Illinois and
then getting cooked, irradiated,
[SPEAKER_04]: or, you know, whatever the process is,
I guess there's a couple of different
[SPEAKER_04]: processes for cleaning out these fails.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: One really model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dredd is a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also the interesting thing I
think about the markets that we are in in
[SPEAKER_02]: the States is that, you know, a lot of us
move around from market to market and seen
[SPEAKER_02]: the shift in the requirements that they
ask of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like I learned in mass that
it was nearly impossible to do a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: style of growing that I wanted to do just
based on the rules and regs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to rejig what you once
thought was the way and you have to adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it's really tough to deal with
that because it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke sense makes a good point in the
chat, Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying how does the tobacco industry
deal with aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's where the MSOs are probably
going to look for ways to mitigate
[SPEAKER_04]: aspergillus, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pay off the politicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: They apply a bunch of side.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they apply this stuff called Maca
zone and a few other pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few products that are EPA
registered that they can apply,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, to control fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what, I don't know if
anyone has ever been to like a tobacco
[SPEAKER_03]: farm when they hang that tobacco in the,
in the barn and the hang it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In these barns that actually have wings
that can fold out so that they could,
[SPEAKER_03]: they could let air in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, if you walk up to the edge of that
barn, it is intoxicating the air that's in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, if you're a non tobacco user,
non cigarette smoker, you can seriously,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could faint just from the,
the effluent coming from a tobacco farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, Ryan crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass weed is weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've actually yet to find jarrable
flower in the state that, that smokes with
[SPEAKER_02]: any flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's really insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you would think drag is working for,
um, for mass provisions there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they growing good weeds where
Greg's at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I think, I think scale is hard,
you know, even with the best people at
[SPEAKER_02]: the, at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it, once it leaves you your hands,
another department takes it and that
[SPEAKER_02]: department you maybe talk to in the
hallway, but you're not running that team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes to a trim team and that
trim team does a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes to a bin and then it's
like blow the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, listen, I think no matter where
you are in my, it just, my, just talking
[SPEAKER_02]: personal experience, it really,
it's, everyone has to synergistically be
[SPEAKER_02]: working together and really want that same
goal to have that make it make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's as I've gotten in bigger and
bigger and bigger scenarios, it just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it falls the black after certain,
you know, at certain scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's hard to keep everybody,
you know, chasing the same dragon,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like everyone chasing that
quality and like wanting that the best is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's, it's hard, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wish, I wish I could say that,
that it was easier, but I do think that
[SPEAKER_02]: there, Greg's growing some phenomenal weed
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will, I will give him props big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he is one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Meg Sanders, who I know from 10
years ago used to do the mindful,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was the, the grow right across the
street from the Denver police station.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always great to see the Denver
police station, this huge three story
[SPEAKER_03]: building with all these cop cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just stunk like weed there,
like there was no tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their grower there was Philip Tiara
Rojo, who I don't know where he is these
[SPEAKER_03]: days, but that's where kind bill and the
kind bill crew was first making live
[SPEAKER_03]: resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 10 years ago, if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, BK Brewer is commenting
on smash hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying he didn't have a great
experience, but I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I've had, I've had good experience
with this chem four, his chem DS one that
[SPEAKER_02]: he ran over there was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't really paid attention so
much, but there's some great growers in
[SPEAKER_02]: the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, I think again, it's just hard
to hit every batch every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I commend everyone when they can do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's a tough one,
but, but there's some, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's some amazing growers on
the East coast that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back home from the West coast,
you know, so it's, it's good to see it in
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see better and better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think it's common.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in a big shift right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's, I think there's a big
shift happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be, it's going to
take a little time, but I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm building a grow right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know others are building grows that are
meant to crank out quality or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's just time right now and we
gotta, we gotta be patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's never been easier to grow your
own herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing I say to everybody
out here is it's literally never been
[SPEAKER_02]: easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I used to be on the forums trying
to trade clones just to get something
[SPEAKER_02]: worth growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you could just go buy a pack of seeds
and within those 10 seeds or even six
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, you'll find something amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's, you know, bring it back
to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage everyone to go and same with,
you know, grow it, wash it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: learn about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the other narrative
that, you know, everyone's looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: someone to just like sell them good herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not that difficult to grow your
own good herb if you just spend a little
[SPEAKER_02]: time, you know, get some good lights,
like the LAD, Grandmaster LAD,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, those guys make some of the best
lights I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get one of those, get some HPS if you're a
traditionalist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, dude, the Borg that I have does
the HPS spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an LED light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 500 spectrums in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually beyond too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many, many, many, many, many people need
to get these lights because the data
[SPEAKER_04]: points are going to come from all the
people who use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you understand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think that's the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get across with LEDs right now is like
most people are like, oh, LEDs aren't as
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really about you can't just
expect you to change your lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum and then not change your nutrient
and your regiments and things that go
[SPEAKER_02]: along with that and expect it all to be
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to kind of take a look at,
you know, the lights and then there's
[SPEAKER_02]: certain things that you might need to do
differently, such as feeding or
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures might need to be different or
humidity might need to be different due to
[SPEAKER_02]: the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the biggest learning
curves that we went through when we were
[SPEAKER_02]: switching from HPS to LED and then doing
ultimately running rooms that were both.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was HPS, one was LED and just kind of
pitting it against each other for data
[SPEAKER_02]: points and trying to learn what varietals
responded best to what spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the whole, I spent three years
trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing that I encourage
everyone to do is don't just listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: what everyone says, try it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see what works for you, because you
might be holding a varietal that for
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever reason might respond in a way
that everything in my stable doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I think it's really important
to not be so rigid about what you're told.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go and try it, you know, break stuff and
then try again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but yeah, I mean, you know,
New York, someone said in the chat,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York, there's a bunch of hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were a bunch of hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you have to understand that
New York, if we had just allowed it to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of go with just the ROs, yeah,
it probably would have had some structure
[SPEAKER_02]: there that would have, you know,
allowed things to be a bit smoother.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I honestly don't believe that anyone
would even have an opportunity other than
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those that are in the chat talking
about that, just remind yourself that New
[SPEAKER_02]: York is filled with the biggest of the
biggest capitalists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to understand that it's only
going to get more and more crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, keep in mind, you know,
it's going to shape up to be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking for this picture that I
think it was Muffin Mittens or Mitten
[SPEAKER_04]: Muffins, I can't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was growing with the Borg and he just
used different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the same cut in the same room
with all being fed the same shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what they looked like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the same cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: In different, different spectrum,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in the same room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it's exactly, this is exactly
what we're exactly what it's talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of blew my mind, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you could play around and really get
the plant to express itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, first of all, 500 spectrums.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what Thomas was thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so absolutely insane, but it's
nice to be able to play around and have
[SPEAKER_04]: that sort of flexibility in your own
little tents or grow where you just,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great idea from an R and D
standpoint, even at the most basic,
[SPEAKER_04]: basic, like in Canada, for instance,
if you grow a cultivar that's under 20%,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll have a hard time selling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you had a cultivar that came out in
like 17 or 18%, it's very likely that you
[SPEAKER_04]: could play around with the spectrum in an
R and D room and bump that up to like that
[SPEAKER_04]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a very basic sort of story.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you get into the actual volatile
organic compounds and the flavor profiles
[SPEAKER_04]: and the different ratios of those flavor
profiles, then it becomes like incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting and a very unique rabbit hole
to go down in the sense of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to play with
these spectrums.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like you're just going to
grow one spectrum light, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in the, in the early part of your
crop, you'll have a lot of blue to keep it
[SPEAKER_04]: from stretching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you have say a part of your crop
that maybe it gets fucked up in some way,
[SPEAKER_04]: it gets affected.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always, you know, it's great to
have an even canopy, but sometimes you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have an even canopy and you've got
that little dip and now you can bring in
[SPEAKER_04]: that 730 far red and just turn it on in
that section and get those plants to
[SPEAKER_04]: stretch up a little bit and catch up to
the rest of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use that HPF spectrum throughout
the middle of the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could, there's just so many different
endless things that you could do when you
[SPEAKER_04]: have even just 10 or 20 spectrums,
let alone, and then 500 just makes it like
[SPEAKER_04]: an impossible road for one person to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be like a hundred thousand
people that figure out those data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we, I mean, we saw, I mean,
I saw a lot of different cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: spikes in terms of just the spread on
testing, like high numbers of THCV upwards
[SPEAKER_02]: to 6%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the LEDs produced,
we had a run that was like, CBG was like
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.7% with THCV in the 6.8% range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I made a vape card,
out of it, it was in the THCV popped at
[SPEAKER_02]: like 10.112 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a stacked, like the
extracts, the hash that I made was just
[SPEAKER_02]: stacked with all these miners that I'd
never seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, that was actually from
Rosetta Stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me think it was the genius
that held a lot of those miners.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I don't know if anybody on
here has grown genius, but genius is one
[SPEAKER_02]: of those ones that has a lot of miners
that are just not present in a lot of like
[SPEAKER_02]: contemporary cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our love of THC really washed a lot of
those miners right off the board,
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a lack of understanding too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the different, the different
experiences you have from all these
[SPEAKER_02]: varietals, you know, like I, a lot of the
stuff I've, I've kept in my, my clone
[SPEAKER_02]: stable, like, like the genius,
like I, I, even when I pop new stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the same spread of
cannabinoids at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was telling you, Marcus, I was
starting to pop some of those old,
[SPEAKER_02]: those older varietals that I have,
even stuff from Shanti.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like the mango haze times skunk one
and a bunch of like Afghan one times skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all the, all of original Shanti
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like when you used to pack them on the
little straw tubes and then like seal
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you know, and put the little stick
around them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, Sam, I don't,
Sam, I don't know if you remember those,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, cause you were, you knew Shanti
fairly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you knew what stock you
used, but some of that stuff is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is really viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm popping like 15 seeds at a time
and all 15 are still popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten seeds that I had them to
refrigeration for more than 30 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll keep you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a Jamaican, a Jamaican one,
actually a Johnny B grew it and he put it
[SPEAKER_04]: in a frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old bud now, but yeah,
this is a Johnny B bud of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: some Jamaican seed that I had brought
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they were calling it lamb's
bread, meaning it was, it had those,
[SPEAKER_04]: those, those sativa flavors doesn't look
sativa at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks cushy the way John grew it here
in Canada, but this was 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: This seed I'd collected it in 95.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I finally popped it, it was 25 years
later and it was the only one of eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had about a 7% germination ratio from
the seeds I collected, but I didn't keep
[SPEAKER_04]: them in a fridge for at least like 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you want to keep them safe,
you keep them at, of maybe plus four
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees centigrade, you know, I mean,
that's cool, but it's not freezing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where they've spent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where it's spent, you know,
15 years of its life after kind of being
[SPEAKER_04]: at room temperature for almost 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked me yesterday, Sam,
what do you think about refrigerators
[SPEAKER_02]: versus freezers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked me yesterday, do they put it
in a fridge?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to keep your seeds for
really, really long times, freezing them
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to last longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use them in your
lifetime, you can keep them at a plus four
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees centigrade in a dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the ultimate container is like a
container which you flush to remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in like argon gas or, or nitrogen
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That getting rid of them of oxygen for
long-term storage of seeds helps them a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder the modern hacks that are sealed
have that little bit of air in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's working against it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Dred was asking about your
thought, Sam, in regards to the seeds that
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd McCormick has been selling the skunk,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got the mothers and fathers he picked
out from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have nothing to do with his business
other than he seems to be doing a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: of it and keeping skunk number one
available to the masses that want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to keep skunk number one
available to the masses that want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a bunch that don't even
want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they should probably keep circulating
the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Greg McAllister, the Greg, the Northern
light McAllister?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Greg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for your contribution to the gene
pool, my man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of us grown it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually starting to go through some
of the old Northern light seeds right now
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of them are reproductions,
but I'm curious to see how they all turn
[SPEAKER_02]: out, how they look similar or different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just started like cataloging.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to populate probably like 13
different breeders that have their
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd has Northern lights directly,
old seeds from Greg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got those from him like,
I think a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Murphy's from up in Washington was
like one of the first Afghanis on the West
[SPEAKER_01]: coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the Afghan one from Mel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got much darker green leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to see the difference between
that varietal and some of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghans that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite similar to some other Afghans
I've seen.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So interesting flavor profile on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very you know, depending on how you
run it, but it's got like a sweet musky
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it almost smells narcotic,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people like the hash from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes great hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to that Northern light.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first seeds I bought in Amsterdam were
actually the Northern lights number five,
[SPEAKER_04]: the closet queen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought those back and grew them in a
little false wall grow room in our house
[SPEAKER_04]: in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Northern lights number five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure it was number five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Closet queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was my first experience with
Northern lights with number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone sent me a clone named Crippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was clearly, you know, you can see
when it grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves are huge, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like Jurassic Park.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the biggest leaves I've ever
seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was really good herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like they called it the Crippy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good memories, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do miss the days of like rolling up to
Amsterdam when it was the only game in
[SPEAKER_04]: town in the world for cannabis people to
just kind of feel a little, whether it was
[SPEAKER_04]: partial ignorant, partial whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the cannabis cup right next to
the PAX party house where the PAX party
[SPEAKER_04]: house right next to the police station.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just all cop cars and cops coming
and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were actually in the same building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were closer than next door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Sam, like, you know, when you when
you started going over to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, was Ben Locker's like one of the
first people you'd spoken to who was
[SPEAKER_02]: selling seeds or who was who was one of
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ben had just started because when I
came over, it was in eighty five and there
[SPEAKER_01]: was one or two sort of amateur seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Ben was not publicly selling seeds
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who who were the guys like when you
rolled into town, like who was like
[SPEAKER_02]: someone you're like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was the the boat down on the
on the in front of the harbor there in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were they called Lowland Seed
Company?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't have any truly great
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, there was a a gay lady called
Dr. Weed who used to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here in Holland, this was,
you know, before they were being done by
[SPEAKER_01]: Bernard or Depositronics or anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was going to ask about,
Bernard and where he was at in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess he came a little later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end effect of it was none of the
varieties they were growing were truly,
[SPEAKER_01]: truly outstanding, great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they made THC a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it changed a lot once they got
really good seeds, you know, that
[SPEAKER_01]: performed really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is here in Holland is we
have a fairly early winter with cold and
[SPEAKER_01]: wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have a solution for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that where like early girl and early
Pearl and all those like early variety
[SPEAKER_02]: varietals kind of that concept of like,
well, they need to finish sooner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there was also a bunch of Dutch
varieties very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes people would cross Skunk or
some other higher THC variety with early
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch varieties to try to get something,
you know, like from Friesland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because there was that stuff,
purple pars, a bunch of Dutch varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but, you know, their THC levels,
I would presume, were below 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, I mean, when you guys rolled
into town, you brought the goods that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of allowed everyone to outcross with
better genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never cared what people did with my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to give them a good product
that they could run with if they wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they made hybrids, you know,
that's fine and dandy with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it helped a lot of
varieties worldwide in the early 80s and
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other varieties started coming up
strong and heavy and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Greg's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, his was probably right up there with
Skunk and maybe Original Hayes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which a lot of people really liked.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's asking you if it was a crime what
Neville did to Ed Rosenthal's seed
[SPEAKER_04]: collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville did what to Ed Rosenthal?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg is saying, Sam, was it a crime what
Neville did to Ed Rosenthal's seed
[SPEAKER_04]: collection?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what Ed Rosenthal's seed
collection was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not sure either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he'll hear you say that and he'll be
a little bit more specific on the
[SPEAKER_04]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he talking about old Ed or is he
talking about Ed Rosenthal?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, because he said Ed Rosenthal,
so not old Ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I never knew of Ed Rosenthal having
a serious seed collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, neither did I, but perhaps we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he knows something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought Ed was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought he was a writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an educator.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need to do is ask Ed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that pun, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have some seeds from Ed that he
sent me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them last year from him,
so he is making seeds, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember years ago he had cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember like J something or P41.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all, you know, names like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was quite a while ago, maybe 25 years
or 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Rotten Skateboards Lobster
Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Durban poison that I used to grow
starting in the mid 70s in California
[SPEAKER_01]: before I bought it over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually originated at the Transky
Coffee Shop in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal was there in maybe 1980 or 81
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got the seeds from a package of weed,
South African, Durban poison, and brought
[SPEAKER_01]: it back and gave them to his writing
partner at the time, Mel Franks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mel Franks shared them with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got them from Mel, every plant was
intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me three or four or five years to
clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was my earliest drug variety,
Sativa, that I had up until the 80s or
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: South African, I did get indirectly from
Ed, even though I got the seeds themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: from Mel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to hear those stories right from your
mouth, dude, because you would not believe
[SPEAKER_04]: how many reiterations there are of that
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask about the Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying, if I'm just going to
recap this, so you worked the line to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure it didn't harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because what had happened is Mel
Frank could reproduce them, or I think he
[SPEAKER_01]: gave some to a friend who reproduced them
before I got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he accidentally gave me the ones
that were intersexed because he didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: His friend wasn't very literate on the
subject, so he didn't understand either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a few years of work, I would have to
grow large numbers out, select the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that were the least intersexed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I did that a few years and used the
progeny that had the lowest incidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost got rid of it completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting you say.
[SPEAKER_02]: With true Durban lines, I've had such
terrible luck with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only when they're out-crossed a couple of
times have they been something I can go
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of Durbans that were
different than the ones that Ed brought
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that I'm talking about are
extremely early, like you can harvest at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of August in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very, very early, and they had a
very strong anise-y, licorice-y type taste
[SPEAKER_01]: and smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they really resinous?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the ones that I grew were super
resinous, but they're just really faint.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fairly resinous, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never considered it super A-quality,
but it was very good and it was early as
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could pull a skunk plant out of the
ground, excuse me, a South African plant
[SPEAKER_01]: when it was done in California in my
little greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could stick a skunk plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A month or two later, it would be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I could stick a haze plant in,
so I could use the same hole three times
[SPEAKER_01]: in a row with just natural sun photo
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've over the years had
trouble with Durbans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low potency is one of the main themes that
I've gotten, but they look incredible in
[SPEAKER_02]: the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks insane, but they're finicky and
then they hurt a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always stayed away from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know if it's the same or
somebody else's because I've seen three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four different versions of Durban poison,
and none of them were as early as the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that I was ... I could grow a crop
of 20,000 plants outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really early.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy in chat is saying that it's
purple Hindu that you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, not Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says Durban poison doesn't have that
terpene that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also said a couple other little things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can think whatever he wants,
but as you know, I know my terpenes pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our own gas cryptography lab with
FID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could identify a terpene in the blink
of an eye.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just love to see people not realize
who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still going.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, land races won't be early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm happy for his opinion on life,
but my question of the facts aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your versions on the facts are based on
reality and his are based on reading,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are a lot of land race
varieties, especially Ecuadorial ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are extremely late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at Hayes, which originated in
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's late as hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, the Super Sativa Club, Hayes,
you'd be the one to ask, where do you
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that came from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've been told so many different
things, and I don't know what to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing growing, and then they
shifted into seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Must have been, I don't know, in the mid
80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically used your stock and others
and blended.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used any good stock they could find
from themselves, from any friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I was happy to sell them all my
varieties because I didn't reproduce them
[SPEAKER_01]: pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they did was they made hybrids with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was responsible for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friesland, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Friesland might have been even
here before him, but you can clarify it
[SPEAKER_01]: with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still selling organic tab stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed his sons restarted the seed
company, and I was just, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's in Amsterdam someplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been there, but I don't go out
very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I get to see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to see them every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bump into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them in Spain was the last time
I saw them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the last time I saw the dad,
but the last time I saw the son was in
[SPEAKER_04]: Berlin at the Mary Jane conference or Mary
Jane, whatever they call it, Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always got great hash to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a happy dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's, he's definitely like a quality
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seemed like a good, good group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, you know, you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the competition for Neville and
his seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around as long as him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And did they both get their, like some of
their seeds from you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's both get seeds from Sam and then
we'll like become competition for one
[SPEAKER_04]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I started a decade earlier than they
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: so interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, I think the German sounds
legit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke, smoke, shine, smoke signs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since like since the Mila and he's
ripping a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's everybody talking on right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got in your jars?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear it in the chat here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said they got some papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Press key for the little GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their work isn't very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: My man, PK Brewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, some good stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all the growers out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, it'd be a tough season out
there on the East coast for those that are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hurricane season right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, honey bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a rainstorm happening in
Ontario and like this is like a lake
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the entire city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, so anything,
all that aspergillus that we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about starting to, starting to set in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert says him and his son have been
watching hash church together since it
[SPEAKER_04]: began.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm grateful for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually started it with a Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed the Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're grateful for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 264 people watching live right
now, which is a pretty, pretty good
[SPEAKER_04]: number.
[SPEAKER_04]: When hash church was at its peak,
I think it was around like 1100.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think last week we had maybe 225.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see there's this core group of
people that kind of want to hear,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, specific things and
conversations that we seem to just love to
[SPEAKER_04]: have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it is the Emerald cups right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, uh, that's where Mojave is
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably where quite a few people
are, uh, in regards to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, poor Thomas from grand master.
[SPEAKER_04]: L.
E.
[SPEAKER_04]: B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had a, like a pipe and burst on his
property that he's dealing with
[SPEAKER_04]: frantically right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll wish him a quick and speedy pipe
fix for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, uh, I can be stressful when the
water's coming out at like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a thousand gallons and an hour or some
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to get it fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This blueberry banana has got these esters
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just reminds me of just older.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's like a 50 50 of like a
blueberry and Oregon kids, like blue,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, banana OGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to golden state banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We washed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden state banana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask Sam what his advice would be to
someone starting their first indoor grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I'm the wrong person to ask
because I use the sun or I use the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: through a greenhouse glass, but,
uh, yeah, I, I wouldn't want to give
[SPEAKER_01]: advice because I'm not current with
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not current with, uh, a lot of things
that, uh, are required for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never really liked indoor growing
because I like to put my hands in the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth and my head under the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus you're very far down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, uh, you know, sometimes if you
want to ask kind of like a question like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you'd be like, well, that's just,
you don't need to ask an expert by any
[SPEAKER_04]: means, just ask someone who has like a,
who's had a small grow or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I'm sure there's many people here in
the chat room who can help that gentleman
[SPEAKER_04]: answer his, uh, his question.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would he go about his first grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally would say get a small tent,
you know, do some research on light,
[SPEAKER_04]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want HPS or led, feel free to reach
out to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and I can have a discussion with you
about lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see bubble man at iCloud.com and just
start slow and, and you know, get,
[SPEAKER_04]: get some, some good genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of the hard part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would say like, make sure that what
you're going to spend your months on
[SPEAKER_04]: growing are like really good genetics,
not just someone's version of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they said these were really good genetics,
make sure like the reviews are there,
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure the source is correct and that
you're not getting scammed on your seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: or your clones or however you're going to
get your, um, genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would say as a first time
grower, and if you're in the U S in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular, definitely look at those
tarantula predators from grand master
[SPEAKER_04]: because that UVC light just as a
preventative for five minutes a day when
[SPEAKER_04]: the light when the lights are all off and
you're not in there and the tents all
[SPEAKER_04]: closed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's a huge advantage to a beginner
grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you're a beginner grower,
if you can kind of just keep bugs and
[SPEAKER_04]: mildew at bay, that is going to give you a
pretty large advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that what's that grant grant waiter
said, low grow big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That generally made me laugh because I'll
be honest, I'll raise my hand here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally when I was a teenager,
I grew big bud and dude, I grew fat colas
[SPEAKER_02]: the size of two liter bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally it looked like big fat two liter
bottle colas, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's your first experience growing
weed, that'll, that'll light your light
[SPEAKER_02]: your world on fire, man, because it
certainly did to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely gets you excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you that I remember in 99 or
2000, I took gypsy Nirvana to the sunshine
[SPEAKER_04]: coast and my buddy's place who was growing
the BC hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, the, the top bugs on that
plant are literally like bigger than a two
[SPEAKER_04]: liter pop bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bottom bugs, I have pictures of gypsy
leaning his head in and the bottom bugs of
[SPEAKER_04]: these plants are about the size of his
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a 10 by 10 room that the guy
pulled out like three pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was absolutely insane weed,
but that was also the cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever remembered that this,
that you could get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you weren't supposed to have it and you
started posting it online that you had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like, it came from a very
specific group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you were growing it and they didn't
want you to be, then that could,
[SPEAKER_04]: that could bring you the wrong attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible to spread, stop the spread
of cannabis because it works by the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis osmosis theory, you know,
wherever it's needed, it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to be needed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen, even the first time I went to
Jamaica and I made bubble hash every,
[SPEAKER_04]: I make this hash with this group.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be all stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, after about five or 10
minutes, they'd be like, you can't show
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh dude, I'm literally
going to show everyone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a lot of people that asked
me that not to show anyone else in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular places, but Jamaica was like a
hot high, there was a high percentage of
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a more difficult time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's less opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people have it rough in certain
places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was showing some people that really
did have it rough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I always said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to show everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just hone in on the best that you can
find and grow and make the best that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how you'll stand out with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to my word, I did keep showing people
and boy, I damn near did show everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus, in the mid 80s, people said to me,
you know, just sell me your skunk number
[SPEAKER_01]: one, nobody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just the fear and scarcity
vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all fall victim to it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm certainly not judging people for
having the fear and scarcity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good vibe to change and convert or
transfer into love and abundance if you
[SPEAKER_04]: can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll say about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the only one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just sell me the skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're going to have to sell it to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we all have our stories like
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like the first weed I bought in a
Dutch coffee shop on the Damrock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like literally like got off the out of the
train station, walked up, turned left,
[SPEAKER_04]: bam, sitting down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nineteen ninety five for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went and bought some skunk number
one and we were just just loving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just this fruity explosion of flavor and
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just it was just lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really, really lovely,
especially coming from Winnipeg,
[SPEAKER_04]: Manitoba and kind of growing weed already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it was like you could really get in
trouble and end up in prison with like
[SPEAKER_04]: hardened criminals if you got caught,
which was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it goes to show about that
cannabis osmosis and how it really almost
[SPEAKER_04]: infects the soul in the way that it's like
we're we're a part of each other now,
[SPEAKER_04]: like willing to like just the risk at that
time in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not have taken that risk for
anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: The risk of like getting in trouble and
ending up in a prison, not a jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: A prison with like the most hardened
criminals that you could possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get my old mentor, Ron Hickey,
in here one of these days and get him to
[SPEAKER_04]: tell some stories of his experience at the
Stony Mountain penitentiary, because it is
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely bonkers that they put someone
who just loves flowers in a prison like
[SPEAKER_04]: that for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bonkers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that there's worse stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Rick DeLisi's father was away for,
oh, God, I think it was 37 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to get them to come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick and his his father to tell those
stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I've heard them from Rick and
I've seen Rick tell them and been in rooms
[SPEAKER_04]: when he's been interviewed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've never met his father.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and I was definitely like one of the
early adopters of the free DeLisi
[SPEAKER_04]: promoting it as much as I could,
giving it exposure the best that I could,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I just thought it was one of the
most nightmarish stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when he told me I haven't seen
my dad without plexiglass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like since I was 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he would have been sentenced,
if he would have been sentenced federally,
[SPEAKER_01]: he would have been released earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because he was in the state of Florida
and his sentence, he was controlled by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida judicial system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were never going to let him go until
I guess finally they did during Covid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I I have a friend I grew up with
that was let out in Covid.
[SPEAKER_02]: She ran an incredible she was a I consider
her great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just say Gretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a visionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had the whole East Coast on lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a visionary and Gretch taught me a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, she was a visionary for
where we're at today in terms of logistics
[SPEAKER_02]: and how her moved around and who grew it
and how it was grown and respect behind
[SPEAKER_02]: the herb and how she aggregated it and
allowed it to get to the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think those are the people that paved
the way for where certainly I think we all
[SPEAKER_02]: sit today in a lot of respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's how traditionally we all called
our buddy to get a get a get a good bag of
[SPEAKER_02]: herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in some of us, how we communicated with
one another to trade cuttings or to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: herb to get it out to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was also like the
Underground Railroad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you will, of of of our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we all protected one another
in ways that allowed us to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, do what we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was definitely someone that I
looked at as an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the Delicey is also in that
way in that same light.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he was a visionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a vision for what he was doing in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like David, you know, David,
you with your genetics and what you did in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam, you know, very much visionary
and how that shaped what we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, very, very God thankful for all
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it really helps me because I get
to have, you know, something to look back
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know all of us here share that same
common thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like mushroom for Mark Scaldone,
you know, Dr. Mark, you know, you you have
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly taken that work and created your
own world in which you occupy and continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to push it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my longest goal has been that
every person in every country should be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow for any purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to sell it for profit,
then it should be somehow regulated so the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But except for that, yeah, this is all
slowly but surely crumbling in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: our eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some some places will take longer,
but already they can't go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put the toothpaste back in the
tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like in the chat, like bear grows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been growing since 92,
then you understand what I've been through
[SPEAKER_02]: in New York and you understand what others
like us have been through on the East
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast, especially in and in Vermont and
other space, other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it was really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it must be a trip just like it is for
you, for me, for you to walk around and
[SPEAKER_02]: see how open it is, especially in New
York.
It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Latest thing that opened in Amsterdam is
there's now a Snoop Dogg coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prices are at the higher end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, Jesus, if you want to smoke
Snoop Snoop's weed, I guess you got to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I heard the Olympics paid him five
hundred grand a day to just go and like
[SPEAKER_04]: comment on the Olympics and hang out and
be seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the dude is he's something else,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's definitely like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to hear he hasn't sold out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's barely not getting it from the
streets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, on a side note,
he is releasing an album with what with
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Dre here very soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did hear that the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get to revisit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear grows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big love to you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the the chat is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needs a needs a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my wife likes listening to some of
Snoop's songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a few I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have nothing against him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I more power to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm for anybody who can be successful at
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's definitely a spokesman for it
in the sense that he's helping normalize
[SPEAKER_04]: the mainstream use of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Said I mean, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One ad of him saying I'm not smoke or
whatever the ad was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember, but he was talking about
how he's going to quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was an ad for a smokeless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole did you see the did you see
the custom torch they had them built for
[SPEAKER_04]: to carry the flame joint?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that thing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally like a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's not photoshopped at all,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just being silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that had to laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mark, what are you smoking there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got this little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perch each here, but I want to shout out
my.
[SPEAKER_03]: Friend Adam Mendocino grasslands.
[SPEAKER_03]: A mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He dropped me off a little bit of this.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, big shout out a little bit of that a
little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ian.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole crew over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dreads asking us to talk about our
thoughts on HLVD epidemic, but I think we
[SPEAKER_04]: should do an episode on that and I'll get
like Ian from high labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to be over at Segre and some other
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can get Kevin McFernandes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been trying to get him in for like
the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sending him messages,
so hopefully he sees one of those and we
[SPEAKER_04]: can get him in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then anyone else that you guys in the
chat or in the panel think that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: great for a conversation?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the question HLVD?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just thought our thoughts on the HLVD
epidemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget who I forget who did the paper,
but recently a paper came out that showed
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was the guy at Guelph University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, and it showed that it's
transmitted by not only insects and tools
[SPEAKER_01]: and people, but it can be spread by
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be spread by seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the biggest warnings is if
you're using any sort of aquaponics thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can spread in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally easy if one of them's got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spread through water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't realize we didn't realize that
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started with Kevin and 20 late 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got a sample and that's what
started the whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: He built the whole assay off of that one
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he collected more samples and then
built more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it would be great to have him
on so you could go through the data like I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually have full spreadsheets with the
data, but I think it would be better for
[SPEAKER_02]: him to break it down because there's
certain things I don't understand about
[SPEAKER_02]: the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a hop late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a leaf hopper study where I put
plants in one greenhouse that were closed
[SPEAKER_02]: off and sealed and one that was open in a
plant that was close to that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the leaf hoppers tested positive for
hoplite and byroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll I think Kevin can go through a
lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can I can go through my data points and
explain it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pretty much every vector that you can
think of that is transmitted transmittable
[SPEAKER_02]: by touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is it is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then furthermore, water is another
carrier that we didn't at first believe
[SPEAKER_02]: was real tools, water, roots, soil,
touch, gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean, you name it, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a virus of reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to vaporize and HVLD,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it's not you can't treat it like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't look.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not doomsday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just you have to be aware of your
surroundings and just bake it into your
[SPEAKER_02]: SOPs now and just wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, ISO will not kill the virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to bleach it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Test your plants and just continue to be a
good steward and check all those boxes for
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you shouldn't have any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're taking clones from other
people, you should have a program protocol
[SPEAKER_02]: that that first goes out to sampling and
get that tested for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then test for all 12 of the virus that
we know, like cucumber viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's others besides hoplion viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a list of twenty nine viruses that
have been recorded in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I recommend just like everything,
quarantine everything and also get it
[SPEAKER_02]: tested with QPCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that's the best you're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just constantly keep your stuff clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we should try and get a
conversation going in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks if you want to help me call and
organize some names and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, Kevin's on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Dr. Someone wrote in the chat,
Dr. Joe Ramahi and Dr. Gupta at Medical
[SPEAKER_04]: Genomics as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get a whole crew of some
interesting folks to discuss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to learn more about kind of the
cutting edge and what's going on right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll look for that recent paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about and I'll include the
names and send them to you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a there's a few people that
are really taking this on with some really
[SPEAKER_02]: great studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also some really great
existing stuff that's out there that that
[SPEAKER_02]: predates, you know, all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to dig into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll put together a list for you guys
of names and we'll it'll be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's it's such a deep one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's kind of it's fascinating what
we're learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just at first, we kind of thought
this was like maybe not real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, it just kind of
snowballed into, OK, this is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do we do to better understand how
it's actually happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no one's arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mights were bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another topic I'd love to get on,
actually, because to be honest,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've in my whole career of growing,
I've never been able to eradicate russet
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people have told me they have,
but I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never experienced it in my career.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best I've done is walk into a room
with a flamethrower and take everything
[SPEAKER_02]: out and then shut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just there's no there's no fighting
it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do is you can control the
economic damage they're causing enough
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can still harvest your crop
without it being severely damaged.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, I've never been able to even
completely eliminate two spotted spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mite from a large greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get it, good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you don't get them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I and we're really to be
honest, like extremely just on top of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's you know, we experienced it three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll never forget it because it was
like it was a burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really it was to the point where
I'm like, we just we can't we just have to
[SPEAKER_02]: take it all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that we should bring I'd
love to bring someone on to talk about IPM
[SPEAKER_02]: and just like it'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: A great conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we I have access to a young guy and
I can't remember what his name is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Thomas brought him up to show him that
UVC light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's kind of this, you know,
IPM genius in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Young kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really nice kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt Gates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, it was Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we I'm sure we can get Matt on enough
and some other folks try like UVB,
[SPEAKER_02]: UVBA.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that stuff had fully worked for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounded like the Grandmaster Lady
setup was a little bit different than the
[SPEAKER_02]: setups that I had used markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, we had that call.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it where we had tried it
and we had saw some some success,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not to the point like what Grandmaster
had had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been interesting to say the
least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm I think we have homework,
though, for next week, if we can kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, put put some lists together for
a for a unique discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely down to stay consistent and
keep gathering on Sundays and invite more
[SPEAKER_04]: people in and have have more
conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to cut it short now being 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank everyone for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wade, as always, a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuntman Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: So happy to have you back, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Mark, it's always great to hear what
you have to say and share.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Colin, thanks for coming in,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to see you guys all next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll put together some more people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to be compiling lists of great
people for different discussions that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can just, you know, kind of start
scheduling a couple of two, three weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: ahead of time and have something to look
forward to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as always, may the full mount bless
your bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank everyone for coming
out today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you all in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's 255 of you hanging out,
and we really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun at the Emerald Cup, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And shout out to Tim Blake for just
continuing to crush that event all these
[SPEAKER_04]: years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out, everybody.
Thanks for joining us.
