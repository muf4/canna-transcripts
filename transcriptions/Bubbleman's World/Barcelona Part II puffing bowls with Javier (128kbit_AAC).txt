[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my city and I show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Barcelona city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time we're going to get
shown Barcelona by someone who really
[SPEAKER_03]: lives here and knows where to go,
where the good smoking spots are,
[SPEAKER_03]: where the good inspiration is.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so fast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never, no doubt, most people that are
heads, people that are really into it have
[SPEAKER_03]: never seen that many different kinds of
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was impressed when you showed me those,
all those boxes with the different,
[SPEAKER_03]: sure, it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So was the YouTube bubble man's world
audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: They loved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love, I love, maybe make more than a
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe it's 50-50, but I love your
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like a searching goal, you know,
the guys cleaning the soil.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just pulled into this little parking
lot and it's got these two poles like in
[SPEAKER_03]: the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: New drivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this where he wants you to park?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No backing into there or are you going to
back into there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Javi McRae.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's very tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Audi A6 is a really nice car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you do it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Acha from Medical Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just waiting for Javi.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's gone to do a few chores and we're
going to have, well, a beer for Acha and a
[SPEAKER_03]: little peach drink for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we're up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we noobed out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The restaurant was closed that we went to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of fun, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Second chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go into the typical restaurant,
seafood, Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: This restaurant, this is the.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one we're going to or this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: There.
[SPEAKER_05]: There.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Pulperia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like an octopus shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks really.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seafood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shrimp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the toppings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every typical seafood and pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three years ago like that, it's not legal
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they stopped it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's Javi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acha is just telling me over here is the
bullfighting arena right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So several years ago, they stopped it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No more bullfighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally back from Paz.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I smell, I feel the high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 20, 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I feel, but I think this is not going
to be sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you that aren't here,
this is it's about a year and a bit old.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grew it last year before I left,
I think, or maybe before I got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is 2046, which is Cali Mist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe a pre-98 Cali Mist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is pre-98 though, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one pre-98 and one pre-96.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for your Neville's Haze, did you plant
many and find the best one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it a gift?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how did you find your Neville's Haze?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the queen, I think, of my seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the more older plant I got it in my
room mother's.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you plant it from seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: From seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: From greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprised me because I can't find,
I tried to find the same genetics,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I know some years I go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, greenhouse is the best house.
[SPEAKER_03]: But greenhouse definitely worked with
Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, Neville was hanging out
there, so it would make sense that they
[SPEAKER_03]: would have access to the original
Neville's Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess after Neville left,
I think they got Shanti Baba on board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott, he made the super silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's when Shanti Baba worked in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, somewhere in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny because when he handed it
over to me, it was just utterly beautiful,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there were like four little pieces of
contaminant, so he was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: I cleaned all the pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks better now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one or two more, but it looks a
little nicer, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess it's time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, of course, don't have my right power.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have my right power right now,
so we're being very careful with the whip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to blow the fuse in it or
however, you know, put too much power
[SPEAKER_03]: through the whip that is only able to put
a certain amount of power.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy step down power here from 220
down to 110 that we require.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once that heats up, I'm definitely
going to hit this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the name of this one again?
[SPEAKER_03]: No Name.
[SPEAKER_03]: No Name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Variety of strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a Lafayette.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cross to a cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: A cheese cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: With something else from you?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Sensi Star cross to a cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheese UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hit a Sensi Star cross with a Cheese
UK to start it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many lovely things that you
have in your box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This strain, in this case, this selection,
the No Name, the taste is not too much
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet, but for extraction, what a fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bubbles, everything, when you put it
in the Nile, everything is disappeared,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I noticed when I smelled it,
it didn't have as strong of a smell as I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it looks so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it would be very strong
smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like now, everybody like the strong taste
like a Cush, like a Mencia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You feel the taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the moment, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did down here boil away to nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost no residue in the Nile at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitting that deep dish banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's the card that I couldn't find.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to hit one of these?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys going to do work for a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are actually working right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind enough to be letting me film,
but what they're doing is they're
[SPEAKER_03]: preparing everything for spandibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can remember last year when I did
an interview with Javier, he had that
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible, he had two of them actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had one box that was all ice water
hash, bubble hash, isolator, whatever you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to call it, and then he had another
one that was all of his oil extractions,
[SPEAKER_03]: which he's done an incredible book that's
really covering the gamut for extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your book called again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the book I give to the editorial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he correct the mistakes or autographs.
[SPEAKER_05]: My work is finished.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the title of the book,
though?
[SPEAKER_05]: The name of the book?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think manual extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Manual extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it covers, I've never seen a book
that covers more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not only for VHL or
mechanical extraction, it's for
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutical, for every extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness, now what is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the fresh frozen, look.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show it to the camera still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to see this, because I've got
to turn it at a bit of an angle,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't want it to fall out,
but how about that for some quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is 73 micros fresh frozen devil
fruit, amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is devil's fruit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You tried the first washing yesterday,
45 micros, and everybody says it's
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had really, really wonderful flavor,
but this is clearly the first wash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, can't wait to hit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going in right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is amazing, amazing, amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Geez, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a snow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like a, you know, how to say the
name?
[SPEAKER_05]: One is no, one.
[SPEAKER_05]: One flake?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it, flake.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cool, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, flake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flake?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flakes is copos de maíz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little dab will do, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: the taste on that is really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: He grow with me, and he don't know the
wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stinks so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Between his, his dry, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And see, one month later, I say,
hey, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: He grow, but don't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is deep nevel.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is deep nevel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Deep nevel number 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy, man.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I, I, I saw it was wet,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was just good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I gotta show this to them,
because this is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: See it under the light here, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really gotta do it justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do justice by getting close.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that is fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, for destruction, this plant,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not gonna be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see clearly that the guys at
Medical Seeds have a strong clue as to
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to travel to a place like here
knowing you guys and just be able to show
[SPEAKER_03]: up and see, you know, what I would
consider definitely probably the top,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the top 5% of the herb,
the best that's in this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's going out on a limb
too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, definitely gonna get the,
the macro lens out at one point in time
[SPEAKER_03]: and give you guys a little show to see
really the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you guys could smell this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so musky and so just hard to
explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell is very subtle yet dank,
extremely dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll have a few more bowls with these
guys, record a little bit of this session
[SPEAKER_03]: for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think we're going to bump into
Flav.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are we still going to go see some
spots here in your city to smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like a nice smoking spot later or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want to just go to HQ?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your city, your spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: This spot is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the power.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought my lens so I can literally
use this time to photograph all of these,
[SPEAKER_03]: get nice photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got more on your hair, don't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put these back in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how different phenotypes.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is that all crooked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looks crooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's totally crooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anyone going to doubt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this, no?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any new products.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to try?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never be sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt just gave this to me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: House and great gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very kind of you, my brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is some of his Barbara.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely tasty, extremely strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just really, you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It melts away the nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You impressed?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he put it just in this little
parchment and gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He must have pressed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get it close, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: When it spills, it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to touch it too much, just touch it a
little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Push your finger on it a bit because
you'll be surprised at how it feels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's very, very soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't even able to touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that he had to freeze it before he
could break it into pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's have a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's going to fall somewhere,
it's nice when it falls somewhere clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if it fell in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have been like tragedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tragedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to be sad, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we get a nice, small,
medium-sized dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Javier?
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep Neville 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deep Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that one of the strains that Javier
has chosen to work with, two of them
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, is the Cali Mist and the
Neville's Haze, both of which I think have
[SPEAKER_03]: very special properties that have been
lost to those who grow only Kush or only
[SPEAKER_03]: these strong, strong indicas, that exotic
flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the people grow more plants for
the time, like for the efforts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the people think more in money
than the loving plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically talking about what I call
the prohibition-based mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mentality that's to grow, how much can
I get?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: How fast?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the quanto.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're asking the quanto question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people love my genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you asked the cali-te question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Haze, but when asked me for the weeks,
okay, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used long from your center view.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?
Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep Dish Banger time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt and Sarah, killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So happy that you guys are just my
friends, because you do a great job at
[SPEAKER_03]: what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Great Gardener is very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like you guys, in the sense that he
recognizes quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been attracted to characters
like Javier, who are very passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the people that take this
further.
[SPEAKER_03]: They further it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what you guys are doing right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is on par with anywhere I've been in
the world for quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are beautiful buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's the gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I say to you out there is that don't
think that it is one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something to be said from Spain as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long ago could you find quality like
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Still today, you can't really find it
unless you're you or you're someone that
[SPEAKER_03]: knows you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't go buy this at the association
across the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, at HQ, they have some
pretty great stuff, but this is on another
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always, I make hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I make for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first people I want to like the hash
is me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to make the best hash always.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I love about the D-nail
is the ease of just passing the pipe
[SPEAKER_03]: around, even still.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take a few seconds, let it heat up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you see it melt to the bottom,
there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta thank D-nail for always hooking me
up with the goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta thank Dabinator as well,
because today I'm actually using a
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of the Dabinator and the
D-nail tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabinator's got the European power source,
which is key, so I've been really loving
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little Barbara.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude, it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's nice about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know shishka berry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the shishka berry across the pure
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, look, it smells like this.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I wonder what line of shishka berry
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use a shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did you get your shishka berry?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a devil fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Devil fruit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, shishka berry cross the pure Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you got your shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 12 years ago, from Spice of Life.
[SPEAKER_05]: From Rear Steam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: He pulls out, now listen, this is also
made from the Spice of Life shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it, more genetics from the Spice of
Life, the soup too, and block head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Block head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it because my block head,
when it's dry, it smells like a banana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing, amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, wow, just to give you guys an
idea, when he pulled it out, it's still
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously covered in leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really tell just how dank it is,
but just pulling off a few leaves,
[SPEAKER_03]: there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see that that's some pretty
quality nug right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeders Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always respected Steve because he was
also like us, in the sense that he was
[SPEAKER_03]: obsessed with the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just making the best, and generally for
himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was happy to pass it on, but he was
always like, it was his desire to have the
[SPEAKER_03]: best and grow the best that produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still to this day, so many of the best
residents that we're finding, Devil's
[SPEAKER_03]: Fruit, which I hit today.
[SPEAKER_03]: David from Ripper Seeds gave me a little
Devil's Fruit bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you as well, definitely the two
nicest hashes I've smoked since I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: here, as well as Matt from the Great
Gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's always a standard that the
barb is going to be right up there in the
[SPEAKER_03]: top two every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see, I hit your Devil's Fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I better hit your Prozac.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that's also not much motion on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how Javier does it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks so nice when you style it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting to fall down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just show you right through the
glass window, which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like to show you guys up close
so you can see that it's, I'm not just
[SPEAKER_03]: talking out my ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not blowing smoke up these guys'
asses.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really, really great quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's nice to dip my Pada in
tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they call this the Pada.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shovel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the, it's the bubble man's choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prozac is very unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what did you use to make Prozac?
[SPEAKER_05]: Prozac is lavender cross to goose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lavender, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more close to lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, when I first blew it out,
it tasted like soap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it tasted like, like lavender gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That weird lavender gum that tasted a bit
like soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what they used to call
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thrills, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a really unique turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you used lavender and crossed it with?
Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was the Kush?
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Kush from Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: Special Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Special Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to spend at least two
hours photographing this stuff so you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: can see it on the macro lens and I'm
definitely going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Flav on our, on his way here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's bringing a sick mothership
that will probably be hitting in the near
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, I think I'm just going to
keep puffing, enjoy some of my time with
[SPEAKER_03]: these guys because I don't get to ever
spend enough time with the medical seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that's through the
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed let time fuel the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have been traveling to Kingston for
20 miles and hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be sleeping in my jar, bone fat like
the clock towers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh vegetation with trees and with
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have to stop and check my ganja,
lick them over bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a biggie, I don't want no ziggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give me no palm, just give me time,
I don't want no twiggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No two pop, give me one biggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's bigger than biggie from a high
grade, give me, me, me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then me puff and cough.
Puff and cough.
