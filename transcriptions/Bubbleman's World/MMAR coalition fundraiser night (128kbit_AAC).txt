[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble Man here and I have bumped into
some friends that I never knew before
[SPEAKER_05]: about four minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although surprisingly enough I seen Josh
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was your picture on something
like I just got to Vancouver on the MMAR
[SPEAKER_05]: Coalition for Repeal group.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came in for the MMAR function that we
have going tonight, the concert.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was with Elijah here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still don't even know how they know each
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's my wife's cousin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your wife's cousin.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he had the Mark Emery,
free Mark Emery shirt on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really more than anything why
I stopped him and said, hey, you got the
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark shirt on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we're going to have a little...
No, no, you guys can walk by.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like real life here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a little bubble hash
session here while we're bumped into these
[SPEAKER_05]: guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my little baby cake here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any water, but we can hit it
dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there is an ocean behind us.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing hits like a champ, wet or dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make sure the torch is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a little bit of torque.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's just a matter of maybe you
hold that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a very busy area of Vancouver,
so some people might be slightly concerned
[SPEAKER_05]: with what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do it pretty much everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to keep it on the down low,
not blowing it in little kids' faces or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, it's educational.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people are like, hey, what is it
you're doing there?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, I'm actually medicating
and feeding my endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds a lot different than,
we're getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're not getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're feeding our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that more people should do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to torch that up?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just click that and lock the... Or hold
the torch, either way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll get one of these when we're
ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Albeit, I will admit that the torch is a
little bit more hardcore than your usual
[SPEAKER_05]: thing to see on the side of the road in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you got to hit a rip, you got to hit
a rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to head over to the concert
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually meeting Higher End.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm meeting Flav421.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm meeting John Berfalo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm meeting D420K right here at
Cardero's at one of my favorite Vancouver
[SPEAKER_05]: restaurants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to go have a nice meal
before we head off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got lots of cars around us.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably really good right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hit it first.
[SPEAKER_05]: A dry sift ripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's so small it still feels pretty
proper to hit this with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely not like we'll do it
harsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just focus on the one side there until it
goes orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get Elijah wrapped up with one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to bring the camera tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to bring in, I think,
red ones playing from the rascals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll interview maybe Remo and Jason
Wilcox.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk to D420K and Flav, Higher End.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk to Jason Wilcox and Anne.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a whole bunch of other people there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just trying to do some quick little
interviews and dabs with as many people as
[SPEAKER_05]: we can bump into.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess I'm going to hit this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you got it with the orange hot
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're hitting dry sift that D420K
brought me from good buddy Jake.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jake made some nice sift and I just
cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe it's OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's, you know what, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: You pretty much said the most truthful
statement you could say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like really anything OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: OG is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could take almost any schwag and cross
it with OG and come up with something
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty props.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll give you a little dropper there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tiny little eight mil nail is
definitely sometimes hard to work with
[SPEAKER_05]: with the flat dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we're making it work pretty
good here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabbing away the day, as they say.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm stoked that I bumped into
you guys and got to take a dab like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's always the something like
the Mark Emmerich image on a shirt that's,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, for me, I can't let someone walk
by without saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And coincidentally enough, Mark did used
to live right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was his building.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally maybe a year before he went to
prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: He lived right across from Carderos.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's kind of trippy that we meet
right up in front of that place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably less than two or three weeks from
when Mark himself will return to
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're looking pretty forward to
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be amazing to have him back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe they got him for five
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But somehow ingesting Mark Emmerich
convinced them to, like, change their laws
[SPEAKER_05]: on cannabis because it all started when he
went into prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, it was his prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the same guy that prosecuted Mark is
the guy who fought for the legalization or
[SPEAKER_05]: the decrim in Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything that's happening in
Washington is the same guy that prosecuted
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mark has an effect on people,
even his prosecutors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see higher end just rolled up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's probably got some sick glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you guys in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say goodbye to these guys for
now, but we'll catch up with them later at
[SPEAKER_05]: the event, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely good meeting you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you guys soon on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've hooked up with this crew of maniacs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flav421, Johnny B, D420K, Horatio,
the LHO master, and higher end is in the
[SPEAKER_05]: house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these guys don't make appearances
very often, so we've showed up at my
[SPEAKER_05]: office here, and we're hitting,
what, old school glass?
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: With a little new school hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got D420K dry sift in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some higher end fucking
Congolese 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just about to hit some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's get this party started.
[SPEAKER_09]: The real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: The real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 90 and the 73 mixed put together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to load this one up that higher
end just rolled up for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hitting the Max Poland.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a 2002, I believe, double bubbler
with crushed opal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hitting the Fabergé Mothership.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what it's called?
[SPEAKER_09]: Fabergé egg?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabergé egg.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's got to get a pipe ready here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark's dumping on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the triple bubbler.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a shotgun, John, that you're
missing on the top there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a gift for my 31st birthday from
Marbleslinger and Brian Ratcliffe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's some November dry sift here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_09]: Six, eight months.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just rank.
[SPEAKER_09]: OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cush.
[SPEAKER_05]: PG OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met these young kids on the street today
and raised them down because they had a
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark Emory shirt on.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually going to the event.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, I got some OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, I got this guy Jake's.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, yeah, it's OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anything OG is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, that's a pretty accurate
statement for a young kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that congolese is sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: High integrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll hook a brother up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: High integrity glass art to high integrity
glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let me pass you this one down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not passing nobody, none of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're too expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these aren't even like really,
these are more priceless in the sense like
[SPEAKER_05]: if they break, not really getting these
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never forget our off camera guests here
on bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not be able to see them,
but they can still pop balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as scary as you think.
[SPEAKER_05]: We always want to think of everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the Gates and Racco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big kind of crazy spoon, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an epic crazy spoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the Starship Enterprise.
[SPEAKER_05]: The congolese OG Kush combination is what
I just gave John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he left some of the congo on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you a base of congo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cover it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one doesn't have a screen?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them doesn't have a screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who needs to hit this Jay Lee?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the Jay Lee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, this is screenless.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, we're going to go with the
congo and the Jay Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcel is one of my favorite artists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a good collection of some of the
old school Marcel.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are so special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcel, Max, Slinger, and Ratdog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like the evolution of glass right
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget when Jason set me up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The congo is an OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: This piece right here that John's about to
rip?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got two pieces from Jason on this batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: One was a tiny little hammer handheld
bubbler that was very small.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one was this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a bill for $1,400 US dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I sent him the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, could you tell me what was
one six and one was eight?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or were they both seven?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, no, it was $1,200 for the
handheld bubbler.
[SPEAKER_05]: And $200 US for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Jason.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a nice big hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's some fresh stuff from a couple
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is cured up from November.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Could I try that cure from November?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: After a big long meal and not puffing for
a long time and having drama of trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: link up with Darren, it was like,
Johnny!
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't love you, John.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: My brain doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's OK, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your brain works good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every once in a while, it just goes blech.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's harmless.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's harmless because of who you hang out
with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, if you did that shit in
Jamaica, you could definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're losing your head, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many machetes do you have at home per
issue?
[SPEAKER_10]: At least 10.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got at least 10 as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, I do not have a machete
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one as a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a crossbow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got a crossbow?
[SPEAKER_10]: I made one for my daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I have right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a shovel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you guys know why I have a crossbow?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was staying at Ron Hickey's,
my mentor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was sleeping in this room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for whatever reason, I went to go in
the closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, what the fuck, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got this crazy crossbow loaded in the
closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready to go, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, bro, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, dude, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my brain damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, you better take this from me,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He literally took it apart, packed it up,
and made me fly home with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started looking at it, and we go,
OK, we got to like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man, hit him up with one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely fun to go camping and
shoot the crossbow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good red neckery.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we might step it up for the next
trip, though, and take 30-odd sixes and
[SPEAKER_05]: propane tanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, and just go buck wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: Red neck fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: With no little propane tanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that's the red neck tube.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, stepping it up, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you need a pallet fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: We always have a pallet fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just shoot it, and then go boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's where you get the flames.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, you want a good tip for having a
good pallet fire?
[SPEAKER_05]: Best pallet fire you'll have is on January
1st, or December 27th or 8th.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get all the old Christmas trees that
don't sell, and you go get them basically
[SPEAKER_05]: for nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get truckloads of these things,
and then that's what we're throwing on the
[SPEAKER_05]: fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like full Christmas trees that are wrapped
in twine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they go on the fire, they blow up,
and the whole tree goes boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, and there underneath is just
pallets.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a classic Whistler.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it for Thanksgiving, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it the Thanksgivinger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell we're getting stoned?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I'm going to get back to puffing
with these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just blabbing on about nonsense at
this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about over there?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll check you out at the Coalition
fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_05]: After 20 more bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, we just arrived at Fortune.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got D420K behind me, Flav and Higher
End, and we're about to head up into the
[SPEAKER_05]: venue, so let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the fundraiser for the Coalition
against repeal, or for repeal of the MMAR.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for all those guys and gals out there
that want to continue to grow their
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis without fear of the government
kicking their door down, shooting them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, party's started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's set some shit up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B's over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go see him.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on, guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: The fire truck picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: The which one?
[SPEAKER_05]: The fire truck picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all over Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: The what?
[SPEAKER_05]: The fire truck picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the fire truck pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we allowed to puff right here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: The D-Nail's open now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hit the D-Nail like you said you
were.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd hit the Congolese in the white dish.
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready
[SPEAKER_02]: for bag sounds to sing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to save the gardens in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we lose this fight, when it becomes
legal here at the next election,
[SPEAKER_06]: the general public won't be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that right, Jason?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Jason has a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll trade you the microphone for joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair trade, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Best trade I've seen all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They pause their paper burns, and they
haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're under a federal district order.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're slated for 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hey, get on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want everybody here that's
still standing up and fighting because we
[SPEAKER_03]: raised 144,000 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've all got jobs over.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the appeal comes out in the fall,
maybe you'll realize what we've realized
[SPEAKER_03]: is the job ain't over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one thing anybody should know for
this underground culture is a shaky lawyer
[SPEAKER_03]: is not in the courtroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shaky lawyers tend to shake when our
100,000 dollars short.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suggest everybody try to talk to your
friends, kick out the dust, and raise the
[SPEAKER_03]: money so we can finish this fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get all dressed up since 2000
fall for nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for supporting the MMA
article.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you guys were here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
And now, from Vancouver, British Columbia,
Armin.
This is
[SPEAKER_05]: some of your latest LHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this purple coach came out of the
oven, what, the day before yesterday?
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: HQ at the Vapor Bar, Vapor Lounge,
upstairs on the third floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we decided to hit these ceramic discs
that Brian sent me from D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got the black ceramic, and Horatio
has the white ceramic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dab on ceramic.
This one's a little more delicate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever has any shades down.
Oh man, this doesn't look so right.
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love the fab A.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: High integrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: High integrity glass right there.
I'll hit that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to try some daytime or some
nighttime?
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are talking about Horatio's
LHL, the limonene extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jaren's about to hit it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he got a nice wave from the rip
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that earlier from the Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jaren just hit me with the Congo and that
shit was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take this one out of the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some of B14K's OG Kush Dry Sift on
the black ceramic disc.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see it as well on the white,
but I'll tell you, it's this beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: golden amber color.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bubbling up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do some macro bananas and show it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll probably look really cool on the
macro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a hydrosol aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much literally the best
limonene drinker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Johnny B will show up later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he won't.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to continue to pluck folds
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pizza Man Delivery showed up here at the
Vapor Lounge.
[SPEAKER_05]: How fucking cool is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: D420, ordering the pizza.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get the whole transaction
on film.
[SPEAKER_06]: Money to money.
[SPEAKER_05]: D-nails for the pizza, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you guys pulling on $150 for?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pizza, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bid on the pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Horatio will pay you $80 for a piece,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: That pizza looks good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a session, was it not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here just out in front of the Vapor
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_05]: DMP, which is across the street there.
