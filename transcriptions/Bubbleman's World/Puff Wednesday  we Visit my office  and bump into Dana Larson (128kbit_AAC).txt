[SPEAKER_01]: We have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World everyone and
welcome to Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_01]: To see you again buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so long and I feel like I
haven't spent the last seven days with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a couple of beautiful Luke
Browns of psychedelic visionary art.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check him out, go to
spectraleyes.com, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectraleyes.com?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Spectraleyes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got all this psychedelic art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got all this tool stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, but he could have for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Alex Gray and he's friends with
Alex Gray and he's definitely a visionary
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic artist and I supported him
back in the day when he used to hang out
[SPEAKER_01]: at the gallery.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're here today for, however,
is John and I are going to smoke a few
[SPEAKER_01]: bowls while we're at my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just down here grabbing a few
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some meetings in regards to new
ideas, new companies, new concepts that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be working on in the near
future here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought this would be a good
opportunity for us to come hit some glass
[SPEAKER_01]: history and so I'm going to bring up the
pieces one by one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start with Marcel,
number 399.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Marcel blew this back in 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the third piece of three that he
did in the year and well, let's just say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's completely epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a great pull on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dolphins the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we hit Marcel, we're going to go hit
the OG Max Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I may or may not have bought this from
Max in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if it was actually in the
2000s that I bought it, but Max did this
[SPEAKER_01]: double bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite a nice little piece for Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does giant pieces now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the crushed opal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a decade plus before Dosa or any
of these guys were crushing the opal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really cool, unique double bubbler
and we're going to hit that little piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of Max history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I'm going to hit my upright
piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish this was clean, but I got to show
you this anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a prototype piece that Jason Lee
sent me years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might have been sent to me in 99 or
2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an upright doubler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right when he learned the secret seal
that allowed him to make those double
[SPEAKER_01]: bubblers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'll show you one real quickly
just because we have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's a slinger and it's actually a
tripler, but if you guys remember these
[SPEAKER_01]: pipes and when they came on the market,
we started selling them on Overgrow and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Jason made this seal and showed
slinger and a few other blowers and they
[SPEAKER_01]: started showing other people, that really
opened the door for this double and triple
[SPEAKER_01]: and quadruple bubbler concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bong was one of the first ones and it
was an upright unit, double bubbler
[SPEAKER_01]: chamber up there, secondary chamber here,
cool little ziggy marble style Jason Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he threw a little opal in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually got a millie right on the
top of the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool stuff, historical in my
opinion, hitting the old glass that the
[SPEAKER_01]: glass blowers ... It was the beginning of
all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the start of all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our three pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we start with Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to say wow on the history
because I never knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have glass education today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like a hit of some fresh barb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some of some nice stuff here from
House of Great Barber too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the gumming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you clean that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't put our dirty skillet tools into
our supremely clean dry sifted resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just give it a quick little flash with
the lighter, a wipe with a rag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your fingers work good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your fingers and rag is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're hitting it a lot though,
I have to admit that would be ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to wipe it always with your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a rag, your skillet tool will
stay clean all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you choose to clean it with your
fingers, nine out of ten times when
[SPEAKER_01]: someone picks it up, it'll be dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that with my own experience because
I was cleaning mine with my hand too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have the rag and man, I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean skillet tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we know is when we get the skillet
tools dirty is because we're hitting a D
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you pick up nice hash with that
scooper, you end up getting little blobs
[SPEAKER_01]: of contamination inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's yours buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little carb hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy to give Johnny the first rip
of our Puff Wednesday today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right off the bat because it's a Jason
Lee, the thing just pulls proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got wicked top chamber action going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom chamber is chubbling away
nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hit is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in this container.
[SPEAKER_02]: The perk on that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This pipe is old, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing because I try to talk about
that with other people that frequently
[SPEAKER_02]: have a few different pipes, nothing like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The perk is everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it so much smoother, so much
nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not functional to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not interested in a pipe that's
extremely artful but doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper function.
[SPEAKER_01]: You miss the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason was always about his function,
the bubbling and everything, the seals
[SPEAKER_01]: being proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's the first time I've hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the looks of it, he's been hitting it
solid for the last few years, but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed it was well used years and
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always loved this pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably your favorite pipe at one
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got three front millis as well,
I forgot to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beautiful design in there and how
they do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to imagine this pipe was really
more like a fun pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't really producing it to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a prototype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Lee, we salute you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent glass blowing as always and
happy to hit some of your history here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Lebo, for those that know him
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we're going to max down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This MaxBelt doubler is completely clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% beautiful clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get a nice fresh hit out of that,
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll both get fresh hits, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a hit first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: The design and the uniqueness in here is
quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's almost a clover leaf in this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take such a good look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at different art.
[SPEAKER_02]: You even have some of Max.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then all those guys, if you look at
Marcel, he's got his sign right in the
[SPEAKER_01]: marble.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys were always signing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lebo was more like he would do his.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look in the top milli, you won't
see it probably, but right in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: is a tiny little J.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to love this shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a Picasso or a Rembrandt or
a Titian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Lady Hamilton.
[SPEAKER_02]: The works of art and the beginning of when
people started the paintings of the glass
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing led us into a whole history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never picked any of them on Pitch
Hiking on Fish Tour before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I met Jason Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I met Marbleslinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Max via Marbleslinger, and I met
Marcel via Marbleslinger as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would bring these guys up from
Bellingham when they all lived there back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just watching this epic full melt
bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just so nice on that plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the sound of it, she's parking
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to sit here with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be able to hit these beautiful works of
art that you've kept safe for so many
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been protecting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of these pipes for 15 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only not using them every day and giving
it brisk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come on special occasions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Puff Wednesday is a special occasion
because we're sharing it with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are our inspiration in all of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You write such nice comments for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want you guys to know that those
comments are really what drives us to want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do more shows and show you guys more
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we realize we're not crazy and that
there's people that are actually watching
[SPEAKER_01]: and enjoying this, then we're happy to
produce more shows for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I are going to be back in Toronto
in a couple of weeks for the Next Gen
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be June 26th in Toronto at
the Convention Centre.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check that out at
greenrushfinancialconferences.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's speaking, I'm speaking and a whole
slew of other people will be speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll update you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next Puff Wednesday, I did look at
that whole list and I could just say we're
[SPEAKER_02]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was quite the list I was looking
at today with the amount of talkers and
[SPEAKER_02]: the boos and the people that are getting
really involved in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not sold out for people to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost sold out for boos and for
speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The speaker list is full.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually taking a look at who we can
actually take off the speakers list right
[SPEAKER_02]: now because so many people might be
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean you guys can't come to
the show and get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely ready for you guys to
come meet us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do want to get a booth there with
your company, you guys can contact John
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Green Rush team because they're
pretty much almost done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely go to
greenrushfinancialconference.com,
[SPEAKER_02]: click on booth and we'll see if we can get
you in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I was at that last, we were just at
those last little booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way you say booths actually.
Booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like booze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the subtle differences of language,
particularly accents and different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love traveling to different places and
then just of course either you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn their language, which of course
you'll have a harsh accent on your end and
[SPEAKER_01]: then if they're trying to speak English
but it's not an English first speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: country, that language barrier can be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had it there with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are Americans here with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: A boot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I feel like I've ever said a
boot, but maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A boot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how a boot a bong rip, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some Medi-Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medi-Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grown by you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've so appreciated was the
Marcel pieces and I didn't even know who
[SPEAKER_02]: the gentleman was or what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when you met Marcel?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first time I met him, Marc gave
him my first plant of My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcel got it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a little jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at the cup treating ourselves and
Marcel came over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Marcel since 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an old time friend of mine,
but I hadn't seen him a lot in those last
[SPEAKER_01]: few years because he hadn't come up to the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: or to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't gone down to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the first time I'd seen him in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have anything on me except John's
little jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was standing next to me and I
literally, just so excitingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: just pulled out a nugget and gave it to
Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And John was kind of like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even tried that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, then you were like,
oh, that's Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm happy for you to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, that was from the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He laughed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been proud a few times since.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did someone like to be able to pump out
some juice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a great hit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks good on you, that nice old
Marcel bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a pleasure to watch someone hit
this pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way the smoke comes up through the
chamber and backlights the dolphin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really old school favorite
pipe of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine the value of this thing
on the open glass market?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you loaded me right up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always gotta be generous with what you
shared with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm admiring that beautiful pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just did a nice rip from it
and wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you just grew, which was my baby
Kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it just like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I just did just exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much simplified it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have to put too much attention into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a lot of people want to make it
seem like it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are growing at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I can tell you that
I'm going to help inspire John,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will be in the very near future,
is producing true organic buds where we
[SPEAKER_01]: produce actual living soil with enzymes
and the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get that from a food the same
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll do and we'll test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just be like, yeah, we fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't just be like, oh,
throw a tent in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're going to stop doing
what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have those tents doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love the idea of this soil that you
just feed water and that we could together
[SPEAKER_01]: mix up this soil, choose our recipes,
build it up, you know, and then offer it
[SPEAKER_02]: to you so you can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's a quiver,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry sifting, wet washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone wants to buy a food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people love the idea of creating
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a really great book to read if you
want to learn about soil is The Secret
[SPEAKER_01]: Life of Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also The Secret Life of Plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those books are exceptional if you
want to understand how plants grow and how
[SPEAKER_01]: plants process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a really good book at home,
but we all have our Bibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them go back 15, 20 years and they
sit on the shelf in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's my collector, Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love books.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at all your books in the background
and all the stuff that you see that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: read over the years that have taught you
the knowledge and what it brought you to
[SPEAKER_02]: where you are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool sitting in your office
to look at all those cool books lying
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not here often enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're not here often enough,
but it's like sitting in the museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, one day you will, but I mean,
it's just looking around and laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit of history sitting in here with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, this is how you
evolved and became the bubble hush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And listen to that bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely a very nice bubble hush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder why, because it bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there we did it, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever see the bottom of this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's after a little pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I will take the camera and do a
close up of all the pipes so you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: them a little closer up.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I just wanted to share a few
bowls with you, share a few stories from
[SPEAKER_01]: the office, and I guess we're on our way
to get it for a meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go have a meeting and this
meeting is going to be more involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're about, and it's about the
7390120.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got good things coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't say a bunch right just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for cutting me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're working on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really exciting that the true
medicine is starting to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually being really researched.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and recognized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And recognized, and seeing so many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these people that are coming out,
like wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep watching Bubble Man's World,
and Puff Wednesdays we'll be back soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the first part, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just bumped into Mr. Dana Larson,
original editor from Cannabis Culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: creator of Sensible BC, and just all
around awesome cannabis personality in our
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B is in the back seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, how are things going,
Dana?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on these days in the life of
a cannabis activist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Sensible BC is still super busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our office is just across the street here
in the Dominion building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved into a bigger space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing any referendum specific
stuff right now, but we are working away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got municipal elections coming up this
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to beat some bad mayors
and re-elect some good ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus our strength there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be a good practice for us for
next year when we got the federal election
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also going to do a convention
this fall as well in late September.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to get 200 or 300
people to come from around the province,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few from each district, put on an event,
have some socializing, some panels,
[SPEAKER_00]: some talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to work also as a group on
actually writing the law that we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a specific law federally,
provincially, even municipal bylaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be writing those as well as
ourselves as a group and a culture so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have specific proposals because we
leave that stuff to the people who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: They write stupid ass laws, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should be writing, you know,
what are the right bylaws for a city to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if any, I don't know, we should be coming
up with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're working on anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people want to get involved,
check out sensiblebc.ca or come down and
[SPEAKER_00]: say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got lots of volunteers doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the next biggest thing really
on everyone's minds here in British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia is the return of Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'll be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets out late July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's going to be a period where
he's released from jail, but he's back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the immigration people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a buffer zone of what, six to eight
weeks or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be as short as a week or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of Mark's friends from prison went in
that and he was there several months,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he didn't have his paperwork organized
and Mark does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly his supporters will be
calling to check on him and harass him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping it gets out sooner,
but we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be at least a few weeks,
but by August, Mark should be out and back
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring him across to Windsor,
take him across in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be flying out to Windsor on short
notice whenever we hear that he gets out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder how many people will fly out
for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hopefully a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mark will be there for a day or
two, but come back to BC pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's looking forward to getting back
to work and getting things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be at the store working there and he
wants to do some speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark likes to talk and he'll have a lot to
talk about these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think he's going to do some touring
around BC and around the country and then
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe around the world that people can
sponsor him to go places.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not going to be like the rich prince
of pot guy handing out the big money to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's got a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot of people listening too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the media has always listened to
Mark, the level of media that will come to
Windsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be epically huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he was certainly, you know,
he's been on the front page of the Wall
[SPEAKER_00]: Street Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been profiled on CNN.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in several other, you know,
international media kind of things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Singtown news and stuff even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it'll be a big story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's just looking forward to
trying to get back and keep being an
[SPEAKER_00]: activist again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you ever really stop being
one, but being free and being able to work
[SPEAKER_00]: and talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been like four plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he got a five year sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got time off for good behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some time here before he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did like a couple of several months
here and that all counts again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did about four years in U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it comes to just under four years
out in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the time here and time off
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's had some rough times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got that MSRA, that virus that can kill
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite common in prisons and
hospitals and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's something he'll have
with him forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, that was probably the worst
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, he's been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he plays bass guitar now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, that'll be wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be at the Jam Nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like him and Tommy Chong should get
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy Chong doing lead guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark doing bass guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a company taking turns
telling stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the custom guitars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and telling stories and doing jokes
and things in between their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that that will be pretty fun
if that were to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people would love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both funny, entertaining guys in
very different kind of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it wouldn't be very hard to
put together considering Mark's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: back and you know Tommy's going to come up
and visit him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tommy Chong was always like,
he wore that Free Mark t-shirt on every
[SPEAKER_00]: single interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he really, that was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went above and beyond, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know, a big, that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all been very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Mark will be great to have Mark
back and getting him high and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he's going to get pretty big on
his first stop back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had a long time to have his tolerance
go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have to work on that
when he gets back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm about to work on mine right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the little mini Hitman rig here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some award-winning Barbara Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little Barbara Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that win or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that being mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took first place for the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, the dry sift at the expo there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and this is what we're puffing right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he grew it, he tumbled it, and then I
cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara Bud, after famed Canadian
journalist Barbara Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people might know that,
but it is... I didn't almost heat it up
[SPEAKER_01]: enough for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little pipes are insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready for one, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinner, we would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a little bit of a meeting and learned
something from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Matt just posted it recently on his
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want something done, you got to do
it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, of course, I added, but sometimes you
need to ask your friends, and it was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a joke because I cleaned the Barbara
Forum that he entered in the champs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's true, sometimes you do need to
just get it done yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty incredible to see how far it's
come in the last 20 years, isn't it,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dana?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like compared to when I first met you,
I think I remember you sitting on a window
[SPEAKER_01]: still, you were working on some little
computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you might have had a big beard at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually have to think about the
first time I met you, but those were all
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I would be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because you were on a window sill,
had a big beard, and Mark was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, that's my editor, Dana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of were like, oh, hey,
how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really like meeting someone
that, oh, I'll probably never maybe see
[SPEAKER_01]: that guy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just the first time I met you,
and it was literally back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we haven't changed the law yet,
but 20 years ago, there was no legal hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: There still needs to be a lot more,
but it's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no very little medical access or
pretty much none.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess 20 years ago, the BC Capace Club
Society and Ted Smith and a few others
[SPEAKER_00]: were just starting to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just turned 17, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around like 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the club was started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around that time, things were getting
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't Hillary doing the driving around on
her bike in 95, or that was all still 96?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was right in 96, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved here in 96, but I used to come
before that as a Manitoba hemp guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we got our license to grow hemp
between 94 and 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to bring hemp paper and hemp cloth
and different things to Hemp BC,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's how we met Hillary,
that's how we met.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the Manitoba hemp guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd always show up with the haze,
which was not hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you live in Manitoba then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't they bring all the hemp seeds in on
a Concord jet or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that you guys, the Consolidated
Growers and Processors?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was you guys, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the hemp thing going,
but that group didn't succeed as an
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it helps kickstart hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kickstarted, it got everything going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely got everything into the
grocery stores and the food, but it really
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of stunted what we thought hemp was
going to be, which was the 50,000
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial products and the fiber and the
plastics and the metals and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial products that you could
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of turned into, even the biomass
for us, the seed originally was more like,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's run our cars on this, not let's sell
it for $16 a bottle for healthy food,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's so expensive that biomass
isn't, there's no way to use hemp seed oil
[SPEAKER_01]: to run your vehicle on it because it's
like 10 times the price of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot more people are... The
infrastructure for 50,000 commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: products and for hemp is no great feat or
no small feat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like billions of dollars of
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just fit into current
infrastructure that's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the seeds, it's easy because you can
process the seeds with very little
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, but making fibers hard and
making fuels really hard, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hard, but it needs a lot of
converters and local things and not one
[SPEAKER_00]: big...
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to build a lot of little
processing stations all over the place.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's no small feat to actually
start extracting out all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the hemp into cellulose and
fibers and the seed and how you plant it
[SPEAKER_01]: and how you breed it and grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things to me never really happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let us have it, and then we were so
happy just to have it, we never really did
[SPEAKER_01]: the big commercial push to start getting
big companies to come in and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, we need these facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's happening on a smaller level.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's got to change is it's got
to be not Health Canada running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be Agriculture Canada running
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the things they were worried about
when it was first legalized, they talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about people growing marijuana in the hemp
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to watch out for that and all these
worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time now and nothing bad
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a single hemp farmer has ever been
accused of anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should lighten up the rules now and
make it more accessible and put it under
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture Canada and get Health Canada,
which is bad at all, regulating medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, which should actually be in
their jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're terrible at regulating hemp,
which has got nothing to do with Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not... It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes no sense for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we eventually get that
happening, so Health Canada just steps
[SPEAKER_01]: away from cannabis completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see them really having a position
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be provincial, and it should be
regulated differently, and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should totally be regulated un-pivotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it should be... Well, that's what I
would think to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like in the farm, they've got to grow
corn, we should be just growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of steps between
now and here, but I think we can say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fully legalized when farmers can grow any
potency of cannabis they want in their
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, to me, is kind of the end game,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can get to that point... And they
can harvest the trichomes when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they can... Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to live longer back into
the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, they can grow it and use it.
Waste is the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds will become a niche product for a
small minority of people at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be about resin, and you can make
very pure resin from outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to make perfectly manicured
buds outdoors, but who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make stuff like that, and you can
make it for a bucket of gram if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: being grown outdoors at very potent
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it... Well, after whatever,
it could be... And that bucket of gram was
[SPEAKER_00]: my retail price, including taxes and
retail market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the wholesale, you could do it for
about 10 cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some rough calculations, but I think
that level of... Even if I'm off by a
[SPEAKER_00]: large amount, those are still... Those
kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This retails for like $50 to $80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so those things are... But the oils
and resins, usually, and those are... You
[SPEAKER_00]: can make pure, high-quality products,
high-quality, any cannabinoid profile you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, grow it outdoors, incredibly cheap,
and then you could use all the other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant for all the other aspects as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't use seeds, but harvest the stock
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be rocking.
Food, fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you heard it here, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we do on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bump into our friends, we talk about
the things that we love, and we share a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of our passion with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank John B.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Dana Larson for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got to go pick up my daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this show is over for now, but we'll
see you later on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye for now.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
We'll see you next time.
We'll see you soon.
