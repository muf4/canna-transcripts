[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bubble Man here, I'm here with Johnny
fucking B!
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy fucking, I'm with that fucking guy
right there!
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna just do some rays!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's world,
I'm here with Johnny B and we're about to
[SPEAKER_00]: get our... Squish on!
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you got first there,
Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Teflon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teflon, how many grams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six grams, in case you don't believe us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm looking at is because this is
like birthday squish stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthday squish stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought some weed from the best place,
Sunrise, so I can squish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let us not waste another second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna pull a gram out to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us open the plates and squish the
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we're gonna go for four grams,
this is of the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teflon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's see if we can get a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little closer to that Teflon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, that smell is so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even as we are outside now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of better light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you that are complaining
about the trim job, I'll tell you that A,
[SPEAKER_01]: the little trim like that will hold resin
onto the plant from underneath in the
[SPEAKER_01]: calyxes, but also you can see that the
leaf itself is covered in resin as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know, leaving it there is not
gonna be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to squish it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's smash these two buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely not touching this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I use my ear to listen to the sizzle.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we call the ear tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear it oozing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear it oozing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you're slowly pushing on the plates,
it's extracting that resin slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now when we hit it too hard, it squashes
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well the bonus too was I had the bud on
the plates a little bit and that would
[SPEAKER_01]: have melted the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just while it was sitting on the open
plates while it was filling up the PSI in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air compressor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that with hash as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go this long.
I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to hold that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real hot, but a lovely press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lovely squish on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the quality is just
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny, tiny little flake of contaminant
right there, but we'll get rid of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go collect this and see what kind of
weight we got on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to be careful with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take it in actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so brittle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to lose any of your valuable
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, much better already.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense that, sorry for blocking it
with my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely no fun, but however I can
get it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we want it off as fast as we can
get it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like leaving it on for any amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets stickier.
[SPEAKER_01]: See now the beautiful thing is when we
know our numbers and we know what we
[SPEAKER_01]: should get off 4 grams, if we don't see
it, we can go back and hit that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, resquish it again until we do see
that return that we are anticipating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a really easy tech that was in
here, just how it rolled together on the
[SPEAKER_03]: end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slowly just gathers because it's just so
sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit lost over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely see the color of the
bubbles and the other edges which is
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we know where those went.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're about a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zeroed that out as you can see guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.6.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably another 0.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe another 0.2 in there though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's squish it and go find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a 0.7 so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.7 on that little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to resquish this little guy
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How we do that is simply we fold it and
then we fold it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually fold it even one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I have something like that,
I'll throw it back into the parchment a
[SPEAKER_01]: little over to the side from where I hit
it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in and then let's close it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have it recording?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go as the second squish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a lot more contaminants in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to be careful with
how you collect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a nice cold environment here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be able to collect it all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it just shattering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting it cold and then taking it in the
house and collecting it there will make
[SPEAKER_01]: life a lot easier for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see going around the edges and not
touching the bud that would actually
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see that in the middle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just trying to get as close as
possible but not so close that I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: get any of the nasty dirtiness on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the serious difference between
the beautiful resin and the contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the concentration right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get another one of these out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you we get that 0.1 or 0.2 that I
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of contaminant in there I can
clean up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just put it on this one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that Dom mentioned the
other day at Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people when they don't use the screen
they'll then take the rosin at a much
[SPEAKER_01]: lower temperature and push it through a
screen to remove any contaminants that
[SPEAKER_01]: they find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think someone's pressing
rosin and tons is coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 0.8 for exactly what I said
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even flickering at 0.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good for 4 grams and there is your 4
grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not too shabby, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can squish that right off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get 4 grams of bud roughly and then
you get roughly almost a gram of rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your 4 grams of bud that cost you roughly
$40 is now almost exactly a gram that
[SPEAKER_03]: costs roughly $70, $80.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 40 gram buy got you $80 worth of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The retail for that resin is close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to $80 so that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of quality would be roughly
about $80.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple other squishes I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you your selfie right here Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B is now going to... He's seen me
operate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's paid attention this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave him a few tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back left through... Do you see the little
liver?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lift it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up, up, up.
[SPEAKER_01]: More up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you'll be able to fit the bud in
without hitting them on the plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: My first Sasquatch press.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited because A for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that bud in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, now make sure the lever's down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lever's down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then gently... Go, go, go,
go, go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it gets close, real close,
you'll hear it one click at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give a couple seconds in between each one
too so it allows to get that heat in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's...
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know when it's like... One
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it sounding?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably good on the pressure now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how it does one last click too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, don't open it too much because
you just have to use pressure to close it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, open that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, let me get rid of this for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice press, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to clean that up pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close the plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this, I think it's just too high
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't be able to collect it,
but you'll be able to put it there for a
[SPEAKER_01]: second or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is real nice quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't it though?
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a great press.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first press!
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny?
[SPEAKER_01]: You done good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Oreo's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's take it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first things first, we're gonna go
through and just get rid of any tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of contaminant that we can see
on the end of the dapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, to make sure that you
take that dapper and really make sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you have a lot of contaminant in
your rosin, don't clean up too much of it
[SPEAKER_01]: at once or you'll create a larger surface
area at the end of your dapper and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: start picking up oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Johnny B's cleaning it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to do a fast... See,
for me, I'm cold towards myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the faster the better in thicker
areas, especially if it's not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, shattering like cold like it was
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is perfect how it's gathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of rosin and this is like a
perfect gather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very easy to pull together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always find that I pull like this if
it's a really shattering, but this is just
[SPEAKER_03]: lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can like roll it in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like... Perfect temperature breakdown
from being outside on the metal barbecue
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then coming inside to the
office.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's collected nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful tool for gathering too,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really makes life really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love my dapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to a met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Gmail guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian sent me that some time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some woodworking tools like these
that are very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was that, four grams?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, I think you're gonna get a much
higher return on this stuff than last.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the gorilla cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the gorilla cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you got one already?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that that one you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see that before we close it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, get that off of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are great tips and tools that you're
seeing how we actually do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are things that you're gonna want to
watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tarrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.8, 0.9, 0.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what, four grams?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same, same, same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same as the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.7 to 0.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've squished it twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is only the first squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful squish too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely gonna do a second squish
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get right on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little second squish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost looks like a steal your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little collection in the bottom
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely have to put it on cold.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one thing we have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you don't mix them for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep them separate like we did here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people, they have that
problem is they do their pressing right
[SPEAKER_03]: away like a cannon gatherer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then you have to let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or make it cool down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or make it cool down on the side.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only takes a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this one, he squished it up
a little bit, but it is the 09 Cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: the burner cut, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the burner cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: The burner cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one was Gorilla Cooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I showed the butt on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to open it up and just toss
out a butt of the Gorilla Cooks real quick
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can show them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have the Teflon, it's been
smashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, this is up here, correct?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the Gorilla Cooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the camera does no justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks way better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B's opening the plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his, which cultivar is this
again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, this would be the Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 09 Cooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super stoked with this because this is
like the nicest one that I would,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is like my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's give it a go.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squish that thing!
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's now time to take over the
controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in there, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's way, you can go in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see you collect some
Cooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, let's see you collect some
Contaminación.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like a more substantial squish than
it did, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rows are, oh, that's actually clean up
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually follow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go up in the same direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was still impressed with how well
they cleaned out even from the completely
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin, there's many tacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold that up for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't clear that one as.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so there's the final tally.
[SPEAKER_01]: John squished about 12 grams and got about
two and a half grams of Rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just any Rosin, that stuff is killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birthday Rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthday Rosin, that's what it's squished
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, we both did a really nice dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both like, you want another one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, happy birthday, Johnny B for your
weekend trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to have squashed with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sasquatch Rosin Press for the win.
See you next time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
