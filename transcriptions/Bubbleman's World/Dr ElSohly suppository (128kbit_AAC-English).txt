[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention too, I think it
was Marcus that was talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis being grown at Mississippi State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is Dr. O'Sullay believed in
medical cannabis, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point number two was that they were given
a contract by the NIDA and they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfill their contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NID wanted XYZ amount of cannabis of a
certain variety with certain potency and
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't up to Dr. O'Sullay to decide
what to give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was by contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: He personally developed a THC depository
and he tested it on himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He believed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he really did want to do a better
job, but it was beyond what he was
[SPEAKER_00]: contracted to do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
