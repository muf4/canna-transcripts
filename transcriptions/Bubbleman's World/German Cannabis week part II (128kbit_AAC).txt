[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're up on the business
lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your name again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bumped into Tim and Dennis yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to show me some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He washed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pressed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to check it out here
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to open that up for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which one is this now?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the rainbow cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rainbow cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the one I didn't smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and this one is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosido.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosido.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to try them out in the
Puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got the brand new Puffco Peak Pro
from the good folks at Puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And time for a little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will need my dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to try the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grab a seat here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, then you can be in the video with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we wanted to try the RC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is RC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I have the lid under here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know the difference,
so no problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one still has a dab in it that didn't
get hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you've got to hit this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a special one from a friend from
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Yakky from Lorenzo from Turfs
on Me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special way for it to vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the Yakky in there from the Full
Moon Session party yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not very often that I open up my Puffco
or my Carta, and it's dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very obsessed with keeping it
extremely clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hope I brought my... I have so
much stuff in my bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it vibrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, once it vibrates, you can hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll both be hitting it,
to be honest, because I've put a lot in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puffco Dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells almost like Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to hit that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to try, Tim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yakky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to ask Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bumped into him earlier, but...
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a nice event with the outdoor and the
beach area and the pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen the outdoor pool over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were lots of people swimming,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are you guys from?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Berlin, though?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was some hash from Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to try Dennis' rainbow
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep forgetting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the rainbow belts, the rainbow
drivers, the wedding cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you locate the seats from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just order them online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, locate them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, well, that's the right spot,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown, washed and pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hat trick, the triple threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing when you can do all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn so much about how many variables
you have just to grow the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to make sure when you wash
it, you do everything right and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything off because you don't want to
leave anything behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pressing, you want to make
sure you're not blowing bags, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot of a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things to kind of worry
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tracking me down and just
giving me a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey man, it's an honor for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big, big honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to be on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it won't just be a memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be like anytime you want to hear
the honor, you can be like, check out what
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man said about my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for us to inspire one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's such an enjoyable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making growing weed, making hash,
sharing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just gravy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, see you next time.
See you
next time.
See you next time.
