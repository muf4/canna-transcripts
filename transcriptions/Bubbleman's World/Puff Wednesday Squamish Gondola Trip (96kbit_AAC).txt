[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here in Victory Park, Victory
Square, just across from the Vapor Lounge,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Henry's headquarters, and I'm here
with Johnny B, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Puff Wednesday!
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Puff Wednesday, and we're talking a
little bit loud right now because we're in
[SPEAKER_06]: a big old loud square.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's trucks and buses and all sorts of
things going by, and we were just informed
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's Welfare Wednesday, and then soon
the ambulances will start going by because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's some junk out there, and when you
get a bunch of junkies with some new cash
[SPEAKER_06]: in their hands, they're gonna for sure go
for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we wish them the best today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they find cash instead of junk,
and I hope they make it till tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's a real thing here in
Vancouver, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually right behind us where
we're actually in the downtown east side,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we should be able to bar half here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, you know, I don't mind people
smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think last time we were here was here,
Mark Henry was just getting out of jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fresh dabs from the slab, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have no dabbers, so Johnny B made
the dabber out of a full melt fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_06]: Astro Boy, probably 90 micron or 73 if I
know John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potentially able to micro dab that into
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I made this just the other day with
Mike, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that bus is pretty loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if they heard ya.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I actually made this actually
three days ago, and what a better time to
[SPEAKER_04]: come on down here and see Mark with a
fresh frozen Astro Boy, and probably see
[SPEAKER_04]: some kitchens, because we're gonna
actually, I think we're gonna have to get
[SPEAKER_04]: out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we should go somewhere,
somewhere up high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to show you guys something we've
never shown you before.
[SPEAKER_06]: We figured why not show you something
we've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're thinking of going up by my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll stop when we get there and have a
little session, and we'll let you know
[SPEAKER_06]: further of what we're planning,
but it's gonna be epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be good, and for now,
it's a better cover a little bit of this
[SPEAKER_05]: so we can actually get warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wind really cools the metal down
fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The torch is right on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, I've kind of rolled that out
for him, so hopefully he can just kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: throw it on there, and with this,
of course, intense wind, we got everything
[SPEAKER_04]: going on here, so it's that good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's head up to my place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, yo, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a puff off right there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get the... I had jam one,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homegrown, man, real homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that sue the mind.
The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed let I view the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have been travelling to Kingston
about 20 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have been travelling to Kingston
about 20 miles an hour.
We'd have been travelling to Kingston
about 20 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh vegetation with trees and with
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny's driving down the highway,
so he won't be enjoying the dabs that I
[SPEAKER_06]: will be enjoying.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, we're heading up to this new
gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do a Puff Wednesday on a
brand-new gondola, and it is the Squamish
[SPEAKER_06]: gondola that's heading up above The Chief
and above Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've driven by it a bunch of times,
but I'm pretty excited to get into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, it's become a beautiful
day here, even though it was kind of rainy
[SPEAKER_06]: and miserable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of just turned all around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a sweater on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to take it off and sweat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a nice blue sky up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll set up the camera and take a
highway dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Highway dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Highway dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the highway dab sunroof.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The old sunroof-a-rooski.
[SPEAKER_06]: The old sunroof.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we're getting close.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just thought I'd show another little clip
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just past Shannon Falls up here,
and then we at the gondola.
[SPEAKER_09]: Squamish gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see the sky gondola right there,
which is right up here to the right.
Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can dive by.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, pull in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I pull in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, are we going to do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, we're doing this, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new gondi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if this is interesting.
I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some parking action going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's parking here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Special closed parking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's parking right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you look at that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is, right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting better parking now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so a couple of dabs,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the sunroof open.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got the bubbly bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some bubbly bubbly.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come fully stocked with pretty much
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sift, red containers, full melt
bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what we're really after right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to try some full melt stew
stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try full melt stew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full melt stew is our friend's stew block
owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you pronounce his last name?
[SPEAKER_06]: He is from the band Ice Maiden in
Saskatchewan or Saskatoon?
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, it's in Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure which area in Saskatchewan he
is in, but he's a full melt ambassador.
[SPEAKER_06]: He really loves the bubs and he really
loves making the bubs and the dry sift and
[SPEAKER_06]: just learning about the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of met him through Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: John met him recently when he went to
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep having a hard time saying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Saskatchekatoonie.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he gave John some hash and now John
decided he was going to share it with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Stu, we're going to try your full melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very excited about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks spectacular.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a 9.5 easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's get that in there and show
them what that's... Can you get that close
[SPEAKER_06]: enough there?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one is this now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you said it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very unique strength.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, Hog's Breath, but 90 or 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that would be the 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so we're going to torch up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to torch up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're completely surrounded by Asian
people with cameras.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Asian people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a license in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Asian food.
[SPEAKER_06]: I extremely love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't extremely love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a big sushi fan, I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I Jones out on the sushi pretty
hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually, yeah, no matter where we are,
it's like sushi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, no, sushi's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time when we met James from Method 7,
I kept going on and on and on and on about
[SPEAKER_06]: sushi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, you want to go get sushi?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: He said he wanted sushi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so here we go, Stu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, very, um, I don't know what's the
word for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lemon to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that treatin' ya?
[SPEAKER_03]: How's the palate on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's subtle, yet strong at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a satiating taste deep in my throat,
but it's not a sharp taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I happen to do just a little hit of
the 73 in my pipe and then I bottle it up
[SPEAKER_04]: and brought it back here to smoke with
you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, huge appreciation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, thank you, Stu.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, um, it was what he says our
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pretty damn excited to get up on
this gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait to dab with the top of that
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so here we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heading up to the chief.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so here's our ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: It cost about 35 bucks and it's going to
be the ticket to get up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall we go in?
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a local Sea to Sky resident.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done back country back here on my
dirt bike and sled, but not accessible via
[SPEAKER_06]: a gondola.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have the whole place to yourself
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just I think with the rain earlier,
kind of put people off, but maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're filming for our YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be all healthy by ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you from, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good beautiful spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice here though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, you definitely still have
killer heli skiing and mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today will be about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're running a little slower today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it usually, 10 or 12?
[SPEAKER_06]: About 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 minutes, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, 15 is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you've got to spend it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good budget.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to sit over here there,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get some of this sort of thing
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got our own gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the slow ride too, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, our New Zealand friend has told us
that we're on the slow gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's running it actually right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right from this little building here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that little building there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that where you run it from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a drive station.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess first things first,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a good look around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a good look around this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh,
yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here we go everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitman gondola rides.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitman 15 minute ride to the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's have ourselves a little vape
session, I suspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are down to the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've decided it's time to get this
session started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, my friend.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab's on the gondola?
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the scene of Sky Highway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have never seen it like this before in
my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pretty much have never been up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool as shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more than cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is rocking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel the wind blowing inside of
here, so it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not sticking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, see, the best part about
this is right now as we're going to come
[SPEAKER_04]: up here, I'm pretty sure you're going to
see over the top here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so cool up here, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you do because you're here with
us right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guarantee when I'm hitting up the
torch, Mark's going to show you what's
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting over there because that looks damn
cool over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got a camera in their hand,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's shooting film.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's taking a vlog.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you at Sky Highway, baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is some epic shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a perfect dab on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's best if we do small dabs and
just finish them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as they go by, I don't want people
seeing me hitting this torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing good.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs in the gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabs for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting onto that hot part of the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running out of view.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really beautiful.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one more for the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're almost at the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: And soon we'll be able to give you guys
the panoramic view outside of this tiny
[SPEAKER_06]: little box.
[SPEAKER_06]: So see you up there soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We just came over the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the thing there, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we're going.
I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a nice little back country zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the diamond head over there in the
clouds.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_04]: People walking around on the trails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I believe there's a whole slew of
trails all around this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This really is to be an access point.
[SPEAKER_06]: For hiking and potentially back country
ski and snowboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got ropes going down there and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's totally awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supporting my red beard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at those mountains back there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get some good views up
here, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, hopefully maybe even if we go inside
for a bit, some of this gray will blow
[SPEAKER_06]: over and we'll get some epic blue sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful building up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the top of that mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just videotaping that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not every day that you jump
on a gondola and go to the top of a
[SPEAKER_04]: mountain to puff on some full metal to
that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy looks like a happy guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived here my whole life,
and then I came up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to see this guy's residence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been driving by this since it
began, and I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't even seen anything yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole series of trails and
accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a smaller trail right here,
and this is like 400 meters only.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Spirit Trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trail that goes up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely way nicer than that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes out and there's a cheap
viewing platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 1.6 kilometers round trip back to
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really the closest thing that's
quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to do those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: More coffee since you forgot your jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we totally did forget our jackets.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need no stinking jacket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get to the suspension bridge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the first thing we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is real nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Copilot we were tripping on.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all the names of the mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Copilot, the mountain that you were
like, look at that mountain top.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just hiding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, my god, this is a pretty
sweet gig.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you Puff Wednesday so far has been
good, but we need to have a dab out on
[SPEAKER_06]: this deck.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you say, John?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've got some picnic tables right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could sit down and- Dabnic tables?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say happy share.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a pretty good zone right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you do have all of the- The
beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the tripod?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we forgot about this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, let's go have a 420 out on this
bridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the bridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the bridge?
[SPEAKER_07]: On the bridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, this is potentially the best
spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of this place?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that beautiful view, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we have the empty bridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you want to have a dab on the bridge,
or did you want to dab over at the end of
[SPEAKER_06]: the bridge?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'll dab that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're trying to film us dropping
the camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which would probably be pretty epic once
we discovered the camera and brought the
[SPEAKER_04]: car out.
[SPEAKER_07]: People would be like, that was wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still pretty dabbed up from the
gondola.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the car dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the car dab was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let you know when the balls start
hurting here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess they have a little trail up
here that apparently goes about 400 meters
[SPEAKER_06]: just in a small circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll check it out, see if we can't
find the ultimate dab spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks like
[SPEAKER_06]: a path someone's already created.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's neat to know this is a new zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we haven't even figured out our secret
spots yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that looks like a good spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B says that's where we're setting
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where we're setting up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another bench right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that view will be the back end of the
mountain's pilot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy smokes, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some top quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's about time to start pulling
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the 420 cookie munching.
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got 90 stew with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I got the torch, the nail and the
hitman.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much all we need there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then depending on which way the wind's
going, which probably, if you do the
[SPEAKER_06]: lighting of this behind this and this sort
of fashion, I think that'll be best.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can feel the wind coming from over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might even pull out the red beard and
see the spectacular view out here,
[SPEAKER_06]: guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called Squamish, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if you guys can see the way
the rays are shining through the clouds
[SPEAKER_06]: right now, but that is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's quite a bit back in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a co-pilot.
[SPEAKER_06]: One minute morning for 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: 418, getting down to almost the one minute
warning.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I have the dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, of course, is pulling out this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just doing that to it right now.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, boom, boom, it's the raison.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the raison.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, one minute warning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're sitting on a pretty hefty cliff
right here right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a matter of, you want me to torch
this bowl, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Want me to do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get the torch burning for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, let me do that for you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, don't mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way you've, and it's your hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You, you go first, bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going 420 yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 419.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the wind's really coming in strong at
that angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks a little better.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a, we're at the top of a building.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bloody mountain here, folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an easy business.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this is not easy business.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabbing away at such heights.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another one left on there for you
and I'm just going to dab into 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 419.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there he goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if his time is correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, he's taking a 419 rip by my accounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about yours?
[SPEAKER_06]: 419, that was Johnny's pre-420 rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, it's just over now.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to exhale his 420 rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he get a rip?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I guess it's time for me,
my friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give you a little bit of the view while I
heat this nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, as always, we're always,
always dabbing and there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you guys go, it is 420 and it's the 420
rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 420 rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: First gondola ride of many to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice vapor hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still real tasty and a bit of a,
a bit of a smoky rip, but not getting the
[SPEAKER_06]: nail heated up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that A, for the next rip that we
do, we'll fill the torch because it seems
[SPEAKER_06]: like it seems like it's a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what Johnny B says about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was well needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm really digging the Squamish
gondola so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: The view is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unrecognizable by me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I've never really been in this
zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate these, uh, accesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, most of the accesses for
snowmobiling and dirt biking and such are
[SPEAKER_06]: given by logging roads and mining.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is nice to see tourism producing
access by, you know, putting up a gondola.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a few warning signs around
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Danger cliff area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they want people to be very careful,
but I mean, at the same time, they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: chaining it up here and trying to keep you
out from kind of really exploring.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, always be safe in areas like
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, always bring a beeline bong
and a dab rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget your full melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget your full melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: let's head back onto the trail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this one, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another nice little bench.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got skyline and sky pilot and
co-pilot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean it's just quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Load me one up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit already in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quick and easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit harsh without the beeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: No beeline, no water.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Get baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you going, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's your phone?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, the bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: left his phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: He hopes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I left my camera behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: You left your phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So far so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's continue on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the back seems a bit noisy,
I think they got their Jenny done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're coming right back around
to the sort of entrance to the trails that
[SPEAKER_06]: he was telling us about.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is that short little 400 meter trail
right at the base of the gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would we tell the audience that this is
something that they should check out if
[SPEAKER_06]: they're on their way up to Whistler or
they're kind of heading back through
[SPEAKER_06]: Whistler or ripping through Squamish?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's really easy and simple,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're passing by this gondola,
you got $35 in your pocket, get up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The view is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go on a nice little walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got short walks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got long walks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a day pass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Multi vistas, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you're up here, you stay for the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got family passes down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring your wife and a couple kids,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like a pretty sweet deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could bring your kid and a couple
of wives.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can bring whoever you want to bring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring whoever you like.
[SPEAKER_06]: We support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing you do have to do is you
have to... Well, you know, it's nice up
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is really a beautiful... If you want to
get away, it's cheap and it's epic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should walk on those a little
short ones over there and see that other
[SPEAKER_04]: side of that mountain, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go check it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another place to maybe do a dive when my
legs get a little bit sore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, welcome to the Sea to Sky
Gondola.
[SPEAKER_06]: Elevation 2,900 feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not a huge elevation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this sort of gives you the
topography.
[SPEAKER_06]: Diamond Head Atwell Peak on the top left
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The snow peaked.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Haybridge Ridge, Mount Haybridge,
Ledge Mountain, Sky Pilot Mountain,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Co-Pilot, which is that real big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, when we first came up,
we saw just the top right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what else we have?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the Chief Platform, which gives
you the Valley Point view and the Diamond
[SPEAKER_06]: Head viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really quite a nice little map.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're doing bag rips here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B doing bag rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just, you know, just regular old
normal people trying to walk them by.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B's doing bag rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got his bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's zipping it back up.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are like, what the fuck is that guy
doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they don't even care.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um... Did you get it all zipped up,
Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know what happened is... So tell
us more about bag rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I show you bag rips?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to do bag rips all the time with my
Ruhr bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering if maybe we did it in
Amsterdam one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great for wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea, but I was just here and I thought
of it and maybe it is, maybe it wasn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: but... Bag rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'm looking around and...
Well, the Ruhr's perfect because it's so
[SPEAKER_06]: straight and tall and the bowl sticks out
at an angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, see, see, that we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was just a... This is a Redbeard
bag rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: That still worked great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I thought it was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, what do you want to go see next,
Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got about a half an hour to burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we should go take a look at
the front door now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well that was, you know,
pretty heavy-duty trail trek in there for
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny and I, so we figured we might just
stop and get another dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick dabs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a little piece left on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll just leave it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just leave it, it's my dab,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect is perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, the bag rip and that was just
something inspired through videos of the
[SPEAKER_04]: past.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can't remember if we've ever done
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we've ever done that in a
video or not, but it's an old Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_06]: special, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing it on the tram with hash beam.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would it be speaking?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't even know what you were
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get that in and then you got to
hit that bubble when it needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: bubbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get that in and then you got to
hit that bubble when it needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: bubbling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to hit that again because most
of it dropped on the picnic table.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get a nice little bit of a rip,
but... We are fighting wind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do better, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if I position myself a little bit
better here, I might be able to... So you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, as always, we're not being blatant
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to be discreet about it and
it really comes down to...
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Feeling that right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is heating up a nice,
better even temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting that little color to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in the cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: We require a pretty hot nail to get the
right hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's really cool how they have this
tram coming up to the very top of the
[SPEAKER_04]: mountain up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the view and just sitting here on
the back and then watching people come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the amount of people coming up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool to see actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice that they gave us this nice
little slice of world on us to come and
[SPEAKER_04]: take a look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see the beginning stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what it's going to look like in a few
more years and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess it's Johnny B's turn to have
a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Putting that over there for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to time this almost perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and your hit's still on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my camera out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might grab a few snappy scenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a nice little zone here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a beautiful zone here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is pretty much my backyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much where I live.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a half an hour down the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really can't express how strange it is
to be in a place that's so close to where
[SPEAKER_06]: you live.
[SPEAKER_06]: That you've never actually been to.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said they had a lot of good photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we puffing on anyway?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now that would be the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't go wrong with the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B with the backlash of rippers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to have to hold that one in for a
bit, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see how long Johnny B can hold it in
for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't pretend he didn't take a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good size rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a real nice little zone for just
coming and chilling.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems real loose.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's bothering us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've puffed in about three or four times.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the great thing about being nice
and medicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to remember so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we don't have to remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that pain has subsided in my body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a lot of you don't know this,
but I myself have also broken many bones
[SPEAKER_06]: from my early days of being a skateboard
maniac, as well as dirt biking and BMXing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I broke 16 bones in my body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snowboarding as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not nice, but we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the reason why Mark is actually
able to use cannabis legally and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: able to do what we do here every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best part about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who'd have thought it was such an
incredible pain reliever or pain?
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't call it a pain masquerade.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does seem to just desensitize
pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes my thought off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the best thing I was trying to
remember is why?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pain's like, I forgot what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're going to go find spot number
five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we'll bring you with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess one thing that should be mentioned
here is that they've got a really great
[SPEAKER_06]: little large restaurant, cafe,
bar thing up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some french fries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some yam fries and some french fries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some mayo, some ketchup.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do what you do after four
dabs in the forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come out down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Call it lunch and dinner menu.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hopeless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I dropped my first fry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Catch up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it looks like it just started
raining.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the drops here on the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can see the black sky right behind us
right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's definitely looking ominous,
so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably have one more little session
in the gondola, but say goodbye to the
[SPEAKER_06]: view, guys, because we are out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Show them that view going down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, nice workers.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you say, dabs?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to rip them through yours?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to rip them through your mind?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can rip them through your mind quick
enough, probably.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here we go again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the utmost faith in us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab her to your left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab her to your left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one of the things we find,
you know, we show you guys that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: puffing all over the place, but it's real
easy to take a puff and enjoy a puff in a
[SPEAKER_06]: place like this and still blow it out the
window and not, you know, hot box the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole thing and make it so it stinks for
the next person.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now put it off there perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of dropped off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, there's actually even some
people coming up still.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll heat you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to heat Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to the other side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heat the other side of the nail up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it nice, clean, and freshy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, clean, and freshy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, once you get away from the wind,
too, you really can actually see the nail
[SPEAKER_06]: heating up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, though there's no one behind
me, I might even not stand up for this
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep her going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Booyaka.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look out the window here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them the clear view of this awesome
rock face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, this is some sick ridges.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a nice climbing face right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it's cracked and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got some overhangs here, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely pretty cool looking stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing how they just picked this
here and put this going door-to-door to
[SPEAKER_04]: put people up here to hike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess that's about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you say, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_06]: Another Puff Wednesday complete?
[SPEAKER_06]: It might not be over yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and Puss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did me Puff and Car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and Car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and Car.
