[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on everybody Facebook live
well I'll tell you something I saw my
[SPEAKER_00]: homie solventless mind up on Instagram the
other day and he was doing a like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook live but it was on Instagram and
I'd never seen one of those done on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram yet so I was gonna start doing
Instagram lives and then I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram live is not available to me up
here in Canada just yet so no Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: live-ing and I went back to Facebook
live-ing look at that mom's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first people in the room hello there mom

[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the clarity there we go there
we go hi hello hello there yes sir dab so
[SPEAKER_00]: yes didn't make the Facebook live but I
did make the Facebook live Instagram live
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry not the Facebook live I'm not able
to do but when I am able to do it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be doing it I got a lot of
followers on Instagram much more than this
[SPEAKER_00]: so this could be some of my last Facebook
lives depending on how good the Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: ones go so yes very nice so I need to heat
up my nail apologies in the meantime get
[SPEAKER_00]: my timer going here it's always nice to
know how long you're heating the nail up
[SPEAKER_00]: for all right here we go apologies for the
obnoxious torch sound in the meantime
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome Tom McCluskey see Johnny B's in
the room Alexander LaViviere is coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little visit see what's up with him
Stephen Simmons in the house dab from the
[SPEAKER_00]: slab I could dab from the slab but I'm
gonna dab from the dabber thank you Adik
[SPEAKER_00]: blessed blessed holidays blessings to
everyone all right so that'll be enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: that let's be honest let's get on the tell
you with these you really in order to take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of your quartz properly and keep it
clean every single time the way I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing you really need to take care of
business you can't just be letting this
[SPEAKER_00]: set oh there's that's a nice decent sized
dab right there to go for a big one I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we should do a little turp dip too
what do you guys think Jack Frost for the
[SPEAKER_00]: win just gonna have to straighten this out
a little bit right dip that right into
[SPEAKER_00]: there oh yeah there we go lovely flavor
city welcome April Wilcox Ben Warden yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a good swing so I ordered terpenes
from Blue River extracts it says it's from
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado did I order from the right place
not if you were yeah you probably ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: from America I'm the Canadian version but
they won't send to you so if you ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: from them in America you'll get them from
them in America if you tried to order from
[SPEAKER_00]: them in Canada they would point you over
to me so you probably ordered from the
[SPEAKER_00]: right place all right here we go everybody
time for a turp dip do I have my make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: I have okay here we go we're good
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going very well Steve-O-Law thank you
for asking
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I put the OFC on top of this I almost
have to show it to you just to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: color of it look at the dab mat it's the
same color as the OFC golden heads kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: got lost in there
[SPEAKER_00]: let's clean it up shall we all right so a
quick q-tip cleaning all right and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the next q-tip oh I blew that out my nose
I'm probably gonna sneeze a few times I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do this new cleaning solution that
just cleans these bangers so good I love
[SPEAKER_00]: it cuz it steams it steams it right out
and it kind of lifts any little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: material that's still left in the banger
so been pretty much digging that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an anxiety that goes along with smoking on
these motherships with these beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: swings and whatnot because if you get it
dirty it becomes a real challenge to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you get it dirty to a level where
you can't clean well it's just not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: the same anymore and it's a bummer q-tips
for the win as well as as always the dark
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal glass cleaner my sapphire nail
isn't broken it's still here I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: small crack in it I also have a brand new
sapphire thanks to the good folks at
[SPEAKER_00]: denail who always take good care of me and
rep their products so they sent me a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new one so there's a brand new sapphire
right there never never used probably
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be going on there soon don't chas
the banger I thought that was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: story from Brett I appreciated some of his
humor on hash church the other day people
[SPEAKER_00]: were asking me why would that guy get
invited to hash church I'm like why not
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a nice kid he's knowledgeable people
know about him he shares information yes
[SPEAKER_00]: market mark David it is similar to grunge
off absolutely yeah it's some sort of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know eco it's a little bit different it's
Karanja oil processed coconut extract
[SPEAKER_00]: processed kelp extract and process extract
of sugarcane and I bet you 90% of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: just water so right on drew Robertson
happy that you got one I'm super stoked
[SPEAKER_00]: for you you'll be very very very happy
with that man I'll tell you I got pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: lit off that dab that was a much bigger
dab than what I normally take for myself
[SPEAKER_00]: nice to have a big dab when you're
enjoying boxing day with your Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: family yeah Brett's awesome Brett's good
to go there's all people are just haters
[SPEAKER_00]: people always got a hate for some reason
or another and I just I can't I can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: bothered with it to be honest welcome Ivan
and Heidi Hanford's in the house we got
[SPEAKER_00]: kevin Monaco I wish I could say hi to all
of you I do try my best but if I did miss
[SPEAKER_00]: you hello and why don't we grab another
bowl here or joint or whatever it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking I'm gonna load up another
dab got a little bit of this dry sift over
[SPEAKER_00]: here some buttered out rosin I made with
Johnny B did you guys see the video of
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B and I playing around yes I'm
going to spandibus playing around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sasquatch last puff Wednesday we squished
up with my bunch of his trim bin sift
[SPEAKER_00]: after I cleaned it and separated it into a
few different piles and I'll tell you one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those piles really squished out choice
I was quite happy with how that worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie well I'll take off one
more little it's it's really nice I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to say everyone deserves to pull from a
slab like this at least once in their life
[SPEAKER_00]: you know where it's just your your Percy
slab you know you get your half ounce slab
[SPEAKER_00]: on the table and all your list of Terps in
front we just did a Jack Frost tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: Clement let's go Clementine let's go
Clementine welcome Ron Jones and Jim Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah Johnny B's getting that he's getting
it man it takes a while you know it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: a while you know I was trying to teach him
on that press and I had a few people call
[SPEAKER_00]: me out on the YouTube channel going
Johnny's not a child let him do it I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like I know he's not a child he's my buddy
he's my good buddy I didn't think I was
[SPEAKER_00]: treating him like a child but man can't
please everyone I think we already talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this once today haters gonna hate
yeah it's super stable snap all right
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry about this guy's gotta light it up
again
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta light it up again so I do a torch
time of about 25 seconds for those of you
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering Clementine smells beautiful it's
not quite as citrusy as tangy but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very citrusy to this real nice light kind
of yeah I mean there's tangy all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: dabber so I can't really give you an
accurate description just there but if I
[SPEAKER_00]: open the vial and smell it yeah it's
unique there's all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on in there that I can't even
really describe just yet but let me have a
[SPEAKER_00]: big dab of it and then I'll do some
smelling after the dab and we'll see what
[SPEAKER_00]: we can find 55 seconds on the cooldown
this is a mega pot so it's a very big
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz that's why I do a 55 second
cooldown and I hope you guys are ready
[SPEAKER_00]: because you got about 40 seconds left yeah
Ron exactly that's what I'm saying it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good to have a few tips and I of course
got my tips from Phil the one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who popularized and created this
particular unit so it's always good to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your advice from the person the most
connected to it I thought that that was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good ah yes I've been smoking
flowers for the past 14 years well I have
[SPEAKER_00]: not been smoking flowers for the past 14
years I've literally been not smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers for the last 14 years it's exactly
how long it's been since I really smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers all right eight seconds left hope
you guys are ready here I'm gonna do a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little turp dip bong rip there we go
put this sideways so you can see this
[SPEAKER_00]: little beauty
[SPEAKER_00]: and the turps okay that was incredible
incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor town I haven't it's true if I would
smoke some flour I don't know man I really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know maybe haze or something but I
smoked the resin off of the flower so
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get me wrong I love the flower for
all sorts of different things I just I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer to smoke the medicine in a pure
form is all whistle while we turp but you
[SPEAKER_00]: said Whistler I'm gonna be Whistler in the
next few days here hoping to head up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Whistler with my family and have a few
days on the mountain do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: snowmobile and maybe get you guys out
there with us in a sense of a of a bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: man video always hoping for that it's it's
tough it's a little bit more intense
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to bring all the camera gear and
whatnot and go out into the backcountry on
[SPEAKER_00]: sleds and stuff but you know if I can I
will that is for sure if I can I will that
[SPEAKER_00]: just cleans the banger so nice quite
lovely well there it is a couple of quick
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs with the crew here and the slab shout
out to West Coast concentrate for slabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: up beautiful they really produced a lovely
slab for me here and I am quite happy
[SPEAKER_00]: about it really can't how could you be
upset about such a thing you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability in it no fog whatsoever it
hasn't buttered out in any way shape or
[SPEAKER_00]: form as of yet but that could change in
the future for sure right now it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: really mad stable hope you guys are
enjoying it I the slab dab I respect my
[SPEAKER_00]: slab too much to be dabbing from it must
treat the slab well put it with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred slabs there you go slabs be well
all right 420 coming up on the West Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it is it's 419 Jesus Christ I guess I
think that's and I'll hit this Swiss perk
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it dry the Swiss perk is dry well
I'll hit the D now through the client
[SPEAKER_00]: be so careful with glass when you're
moving it goodness all right here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: put this I got the sapphire with the Cory
cotton drop down we got that plugged in
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 for me is in about 20 seconds my nail
is heating up I'll probably hit it towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of this 420 but I think I want to
catch it nonetheless and everyone else of
[SPEAKER_00]: course jump in 420 do it up I guess I
Johnny be in the room earlier who else is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room what's everyone puffing on
there's Sabo Shen what's going on Sabo mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: vape exhale it's funny because who's shirt
am I wearing but the one Sabo gave me when
[SPEAKER_00]: he was here last very cool I hope you come
again dude I felt like that was gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: become a regular thing with you and your
less than two-hour flight away from San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco to Vancouver boom I'm gonna see
the bubble man I can't wait till I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: because I will literally do things just
like that just like that sure I'll go down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: for the for an afternoon geez I might miss
this 420 this nail is heating up slow I
[SPEAKER_00]: got about 20 seconds left I think I'll get
some of it in it'll just be a nice low
[SPEAKER_00]: temp hit all right who's hitting it with
me we're ready Rebecca casa casas reacted
[SPEAKER_00]: give love here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: that was like the super lowest temp barb
dry sift rip ever smells like fuzzy
[SPEAKER_00]: peaches those candies fuzzy peaches that's
what it tastes like too good morning
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have energy my god that
was like the lightest craziest like that
[SPEAKER_00]: just was insane that was like 400 degrees
my 420 rip super tasty but I didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: barely get a rip compared to the last two
ribs that that were quite well eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: originally probably from the great
gardener but no this was grown and sifted
[SPEAKER_00]: by some other people in Vancouver this is
this is it right here little little dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift piece this was done by van city
extracts can check them out on Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: van city extracts doing some great things
they got their shit together they know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry sift they're following the the
static tech and they use I think they do
[SPEAKER_00]: some wet wash as well and some rosin so
yeah a couple of the guys in town that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it proper there are a few people out
there that aren't on the oil bandwagon and
[SPEAKER_00]: are you know really focusing their
attentions on producing full melt resins
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think it's a good idea you know
it's kind of like I tell people all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time the full melt resin is to the hash
maker as the hand shooting is to the
[SPEAKER_00]: photographer so you know Indra was
mentioning the other day on hash church
[SPEAKER_00]: that Todd was telling him about the rail
systems that you can get that can move
[SPEAKER_00]: your camera like a millis millimeter at a
time perfectly take get it into perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: focus every time which is don't get me
wrong incredible but you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to take pictures like that you
want to really learn how to hold your
[SPEAKER_00]: breath and your camera and take these
great shots and I feel the same way with
[SPEAKER_00]: with solventless resin with mechanical
screen separations either wet washed or
[SPEAKER_00]: dry even with rosin to that level to be
able to learn how to do these solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: methods produces this mentality in your
mind like okay I'm getting away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent so throughout that whole process
you're probably going to avoid solvents
[SPEAKER_00]: like even if it comes to oh we need to
clean these screens well let's come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with some methods like what bet what's the
best way we could clean our screens so
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool welcome James Buzzell just
something that I saw as a little a little
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of connection there as to you know
the differences between when I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: photographers look for macro especially
learn how to shoot with your hands like
[SPEAKER_00]: take the picture before you get the tripod
and the button and the rail system you
[SPEAKER_00]: know to the point where it's a robot
taking your picture for you and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: programming it that's awesome but do that
later once you've learned the old-school
[SPEAKER_00]: method and I say the same thing with
hashes and stuff learn these simple
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless methods and you can go on to
play with some intense oil extractions and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do some monomolecular you know
molecular short path distillation or you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do roto vaping or you can do whatever
you can even do THCA and CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: crystallization so there's lots of ways
you can just keep taking this plant as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as you want to take it but it's
interesting it's kind of like the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: I say to people you know if only everyone
drove a motorcycle for the first year of
[SPEAKER_00]: having a license they would learn how
vulnerable they are and how scary it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: be outside of cars without a car that once
they got their license and they were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive a real car I think that that
would have a profound effect on people and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd maybe see less pedestrians get hit
just a different way to to go about
[SPEAKER_00]: learning things I guess yeah there you go
that's what makes a true OG good evening
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble man good evening to you Tom Aderman
senior I hope you're having a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: evening in on this boxing day that we're
having quite lovely we woke up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: snowstorm snowing big snowflakes just all
the kids playing on the driveways in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain it was very good I also thought
hash church Santa was awesome I put it up
[SPEAKER_00]: on Facebook and I posted it on Instagram
as well just the little clip of Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: coming and having it dab and D420K going
fuck I think Santa needs a turp dip it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just pretty awesome it's going very well
Cooper and the pow-pow is extremely deep
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting my sled on my truck tomorrow
and I'm gonna be getting up there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future so obviously if I can I will
do some live videos while I'm up there and
[SPEAKER_00]: if not I will make sure I bring my video
camera and everything else that I bring
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a nice make a nice video for you
guys to share if you guys haven't seen my
[SPEAKER_00]: snowmobile videos on welcome Selena on
YouTube you should definitely check out
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble man snowmobile Brandywine and
bubble man snowmobile I can't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's called but there's like four or
five of them where there's some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: epic snowmobiling they've got very low
views I don't think people know the videos
[SPEAKER_00]: are up but I uploaded them like a year or
two ago and they're definitely worth
[SPEAKER_00]: checking out yeah yeah thanks Tavi Tavi
Gonzalez respect to your pops I get that
[SPEAKER_00]: reference with motorcycles yeah I don't
know if I have usually my pops is right
[SPEAKER_00]: nearby me here it's weird that he's not I
must have put him away somehow or I put
[SPEAKER_00]: him over there somewhere I always have a
picture of my dad nearby of course I lost
[SPEAKER_00]: my father to a motorcycle accident about
11 years ago thank you Selena happiest of
[SPEAKER_00]: holidays to you as well the hash church
fam is all over right now some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: back home I know Tony's in Florida and
some of them are just out and about
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying the holidays as they should be oh
nice Spencer I'm glad you've seen those
[SPEAKER_00]: snowboard snowmobile videos because a
couple of them are pretty epic like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of some of the most I always wanted
to make like footage and I've done it with
[SPEAKER_00]: my drone footage that was just as nice a
footage is that you could you know like go
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube and look up epic footage I find
all sorts of amazing footage but some of
[SPEAKER_00]: like that particular footage the
snowmobile footage in Rutherford Creek
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going up the the I'm going up
the mountain on my snowmobile and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no tracks at all that's like as beautiful
of snowmobile footage as you can find like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll compare that shit to anything that's
out there right now because it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: blooper it was a perfect day there were
film crews filming all over that day we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw like three or four film crews filming
even Nike Nike had a film crew up there
[SPEAKER_00]: filming a commercial with this pro
snowboarder girl I can't remember what her
[SPEAKER_00]: name was but she's some epic snowboard
rider that was just slaying the dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: that day we sat and watched her for a
while do this do this big move off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cliff you know like a 50-foot cliff you
know backside 540 or a backflip or some
[SPEAKER_00]: other epic thing but I never even saw the
commercial in the end never even saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial I'm starting a channel on my
see do in Florida DJ Mavic footage coming
[SPEAKER_00]: soon oh shit Tommy are you the dude that
held up a selfie and you had like us a see
[SPEAKER_00]: do in the background is that who you are
social media is so trippy because of
[SPEAKER_00]: course I've never met most of you guys but
I have a memory where I can remember
[SPEAKER_00]: things and I'm pretty sure he's one that
hey thank you Rebecca I wish you the best
[SPEAKER_00]: as well you're not related to Chris are
you bar chance Derek Stanton joined yes
[SPEAKER_00]: sir see I thought so tabby that's cool I
smiled for sure when I saw the selfie I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like I was like that looks like my
snowmobile but I think it's a sea view
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously although people do take
snowmobiles on water all right well man
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Chris he's just gone through
the most horrendous horrific like I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even really talk about it but it's like I
feel very bad for Chris and my positive oh
[SPEAKER_00]: my goodness Rebecca my most positive of
vibrations towards you and your son he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: trooper to be going through what he's
going through right now with his jaw and
[SPEAKER_00]: his teeth and it's just I'm just on the
side I'm not super close with Chris we've
[SPEAKER_00]: hung out on a few occasions I've met him
and I were definitely sort of kindred
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers in a sense but I don't engage
with him a ton on social media but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: been secretly sending my most positive of
thoughts to him because that's that's some
[SPEAKER_00]: serious shit that he's going through right
now really feel felt bad for him but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know whatever doesn't kill us really does
make us stronger in that sense it's
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible the things that humans can go
through and pass through the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: and make it right through the whole
experience it's pretty wild anyway guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm gonna head on over I hear my son
crying for Dada on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: door so I should go see what he's up to
maybe go play spider-man or some other
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome thing with him he's two and a half
so I'll go make his day but thank you all
[SPEAKER_00]: for watching me on this boxing day I do
appreciate it and if you haven't already
[SPEAKER_00]: go hang out with your loved ones life is
short you never know what's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a squeeze peace out everybody
