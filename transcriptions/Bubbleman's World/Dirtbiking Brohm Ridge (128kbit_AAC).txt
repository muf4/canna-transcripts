to actual an oldie but a goodie video for
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys to share I did this one other
time with a snowmobile video that was
[SPEAKER_00]: about two years old and I basically Found
it in my archives and did a short
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction as well as a maybe even a
middle a Little talk in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two snowboard videos or
snowmobile videos And then just finished
[SPEAKER_00]: it off and I thought I would do the same
thing today I found a really great one of
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my greatest dirt bike ascents ever
Going as high as I can up and it happened
[SPEAKER_00]: just up the road from me past a little
north of Squamish on the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Whistler There's a little place called Cat
Lake and Cat Lake takes you into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Garibaldi mountain range up through Brome
Ridge And if you Google Brome Ridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's BROHM It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cat up there that the Snowmobile
Club has had for years and you can rent it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a fairly reasonable price and it's
pretty awesome So this is a video of that.

minute long video and feel free to fast
