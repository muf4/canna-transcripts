[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't filmed a video for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released a macro photographs from 2008
and I have 0, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 all
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of queued, but I didn't want to just
shoot a bunch of macro photographs all at
[SPEAKER_00]: once, so I figured today I would do some
hits out of the sublimator, which we have
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, the 2.0 XTR, as well as the
D-nail, which we have right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: plugged into the quartz puke and bee bowl,
and it's in a Bubble Man edition ruler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of neat having hit one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also pulled out my little, I guess they
call this the, was it a pea shooter?
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a name for it, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin gave me this pipe a couple of years
ago at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a little boo-boo, broke the bistable,
but the way the down stem fits on this one
[SPEAKER_00]: still works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to hit that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got this gift from Nate Dizzle when I
brought him and Steve Hopps to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry I met in Amsterdam, we brought them
to Germany to link up with Martin from
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruhr where they did some collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very nice of Nate to give me that
pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve also gave me a little pipe that I
would love to have here doing this little
[SPEAKER_00]: gauntlet, but unfortunately I smashed that
one just a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also last but finally not least,
the Sheldon Black, which Richard gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: several years ago now from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is it, a six arm, pretty
straightforward little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Hippo for fixing this bistable
because I broke that about a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I've got the mothership here
ready to go with the XTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually what we should do is we'll show
you turning on all the units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the D-nail, which is right here,
this is my custom bubble man version,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got the remote control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simple as pushing that little button is
going to turn that unit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be up to temperature in about
three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The XTR also has a nice little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just push that little button,
the light goes on, and then we dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go for early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys can see that
right there, but all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important once you do turn the
sublimator on, never to, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: D-nail for that matter, these are both hot
units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful as you're leaning over.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any way dealing with this unit,
you just have to remember that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very hot and that you can burn yourself if
you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think while we are waiting for the
D-nail and the sublimator to turn on,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn on the Ember,
which is a wireless ceramic heater,
[SPEAKER_00]: much like the Erbiron, and that was gifted
to me three or four years ago in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, I think we're going to hit
some Seedman Hayes bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a custom stainless steel screen
inserted into the Lux bowl, which was also
[SPEAKER_00]: a gift from Richard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, lots of kind people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suspect for this, we are going to
need a little B-line, which I have many of
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, and a little lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of things I haven't needed for a
while, but it just goes to show I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people asking me what you prefer
this, what you prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I first got my sublimator,
I used it endlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got my D-nail, I used it
endlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got the B-line, I used it
endlessly, and now I'm using basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few days, the sublimator and the
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sublimator is allowing me to hit Erb
again, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have Solo from Ritzer, which is
another cordless little vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great for hitting Erb on the go,
but it doesn't really give you that punch
[SPEAKER_00]: that the sublimator will give you pretty
much every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, light the old B-line with the
greenhouse lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this going with started,
shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always nice to start a gauntlet with some
mind-melding sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedsman Hayes bubble hash often is the
best in around the 45 to 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular batch that I just hit is a
45 micron, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The D-nail will be hitting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to go with the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's go rip some great gardener's
sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dry sift that I cleaned up a few
weeks back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely beautiful dry sift,
even through a single screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed to clean it up a little bit and
make it a little bit more beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this will also be my first D-nail rip
out of pretty much anything other than a
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking forward to hitting my custom
ruler.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the quartz carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carp cap as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we did the B-line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit an ember rip real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do an ember rip of some Bubba Kush
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to go for the ember rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got bowls and bowls and bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do the ember rip out of the little
guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't actually have my three-push bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'll have to throw the stainless steel
onto this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some of that Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the feel of this bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just having the Bee Man Ruler in my hand,
which funny enough, this is a Bee Man
Ruler.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, it has my logo etched into the
back, which you can kind of see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got it in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my color sequence, red, gold,
and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just turned on the ember as I was going to
hit the first bowl with it, and I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do the B-line first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, B-line, D-nail, and now we're going to
ember up once that gets nice and red hot
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's got a blue light that's half red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it goes full red, that's
generally where you see the tip of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic turn orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got a few more pipes to rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to the sublimator herb
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do both a sublimator herb and
a formal bubble rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really grabbed me by the back of the
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite amazing how different each one
of those hits were.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the combustion with the flame,
to the D-nail rip with the quartz bowl,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ember rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sublimator will be up to temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, generally with the sublimator,
to actually get it to work, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put it in the bowl, heating the
bowl is part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really get sublimator rips with
a cold bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heating up the bowl to the temperature
that the nail, or the wand, or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to call the unit, is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that you learn
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've got two types of herb here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, if you can imagine, some UBC
chemo and some Rockstar from Remo,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to be a month and a half ago when
I went there the first time, and shared
[SPEAKER_00]: with you a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've also got some really
beautiful, it's one of John's Kush's.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's just purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these, because I get given
herb all the time, and I don't really,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically often give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came across the sublimator,
I started saving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sublimator, I sent it back for the new
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been waiting, so I wasn't using
cannabis, so basically this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: became very dry, which, in my opinion,
is generally pretty good for vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really want moist herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find, even when the sublimator isn't
giving me that first real right away rip,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's generally because there's too much
moisture left in the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we will grind it up with one of John's
Medtainers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't see me do that very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad, I've never really been able to
promote this little herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful product of John's,
and it's not because I dislike it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just that I've never used it for
anything other than to carry stacks of
[SPEAKER_00]: hashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now that's all changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start with John?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure won't need to do much to powder that
herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the tool that Enrico supplies to stuff
the herb down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fluffy, so if you leave it sit,
this goes into the bowl a fair distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've seen people do this as well,
where they push the top of the sublimator
[SPEAKER_00]: down onto the herb, and it can potentially
cause a little bit of burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't even really describe the subtle
differences and nuances that you'll feel
[SPEAKER_00]: when you hit a sublimator for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something different there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something a little bit more than
what the other vaporization companies have
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really nice taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packed with a really great hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how much I put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little tiny nugget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has me hacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than all those beautiful bowls of
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, well, thanks for watching.
We'll see you soon on Bowling Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
you you
