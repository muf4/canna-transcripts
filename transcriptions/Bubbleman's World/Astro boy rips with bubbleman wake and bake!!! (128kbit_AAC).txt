[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just figured I would rip up a little dab
of some fresh frozen Astro Boy from TGA
[SPEAKER_00]: with you guys today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gearing up for a Jamaica trip here so
I got my colors on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be heading down there with
Tony from River Rock and potentially Scott
[SPEAKER_00]: from Rare Dankness and some other cool
folks and we're gonna do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: film in there towards the end of April.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now I figured we would do a little
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mothership, day nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
