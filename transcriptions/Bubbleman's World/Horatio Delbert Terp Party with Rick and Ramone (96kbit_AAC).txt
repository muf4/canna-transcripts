[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is almost 1am.
[SPEAKER_06]: My entire family's upstairs asleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio's wife's in the next room,
passed out on the couch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are ready to do a show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, quick little pre-hash church
session.
[SPEAKER_10]: Took an hour to set up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Took you an hour and a half to drive out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're well and sober, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're gonna go through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're well and sober, so yeah,
I gotta welcome Horatio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio in the house, he's brought all
sorts of fun stuff for us to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's, I don't know man, just shared with
us what we've got.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, have these guys been introduced?
[SPEAKER_06]: They have been introduced in the last
couple of videos.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't really released a video yet,
but we filmed a little bit of the hijinks
[SPEAKER_06]: that we did going and picking up the boat
the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we had to go after that and pick
up dirt bikes and swammers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about five and a half hours of
driving.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had Dave in the back seat just like
literally like a dab master.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just dab, dab, dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was quite awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, Ramon and Rick are also in the
house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got sublimators set up in
straight fabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got quartz puking beagle bowls set
up in the Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got the silicon carbide nail set
up in the Taurus with the drop down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a titanium hybrid nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I'll just pass it over to you
Horatio.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got so much stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to dab a little, I mean,
some of this stuff was made within minutes
[SPEAKER_10]: of me hitting the car, rushing up to try
to get a little THCA fraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's explore modulating strains with more
THC to see where the genetics could have
[SPEAKER_10]: gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we know we got tons of turps,
but where is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's that match?
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoke some LHL.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got some seven star whipped up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to get heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a full six course dinner,
which we served up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six course of cannabinoids, of
phyto-cannabinoids, of sacking,
[SPEAKER_06]: saturating our endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what time it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what time it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone just left that as a comment on the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: That he doesn't get high, he gets smacks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Smacks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Saturate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Saturate my endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like smacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to smacks up, what's that,
the LHL?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there it is, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You pretty much just think that that's
some CO2 extract or some crazy
[SPEAKER_06]: hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the fact that it's neither.
[SPEAKER_06]: What strain is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's our famous BC Fookies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fookies?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I love it on its own when I'm not
trying to turn it into something it's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to explore it.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are all going to get knocked over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's keep picking them up, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a fun game, and every time we
knock the turps over, you know it's your
[SPEAKER_06]: time to take a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a smack kind of game,
saturating your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess when it's your, it's a syac.
[SPEAKER_06]: Syac.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always fun to go through these little
videos with Horatio, because he literally
[SPEAKER_06]: puts thought into these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that we're doing something
different.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's going to be up first?
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to go up?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to turn that down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all desperate for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's on, I think we've got you at
about 690 degrees, and it's on the
[SPEAKER_06]: silicone carbide bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll want to carve that with that,
because it is the only carb on the table
[SPEAKER_06]: that will actually cover this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one goes in.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one goes in, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my,
my.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tastes like mangoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it tastes, it's more complex than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very citrusy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is the mercy in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you got to smell the ramos,
what was the fruitiness?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, it's, I like the smell,
but I can't name anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the B, yeah, it's the B.C.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bud Depot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's no Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I didn't see anything like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't look like Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just these giant, huge nuggets,
but they were covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bigger than his whole arm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you guys watch Bubble Man's
World, you've seen it on the Remo Beast
[SPEAKER_06]: Mode video.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you've checked out Remo Urban
Growers channel, it's in many of videos.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no shortage of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he's got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That one fits great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if it's fitting like that,
that's perfect.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!
[SPEAKER_06]: We got sessions to do here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, you guys talked a fair bit
of different extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something special to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something different, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would have thought?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't expect it to be so exact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, every time I, it's like a balance.
[SPEAKER_10]: You literally go is, if every turp's a
solvent, the better you do, the more
[SPEAKER_10]: unstable.
[SPEAKER_10]: But is, you know, no one ever snowed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, when is that a true guide?
[SPEAKER_10]: Until you hit something that's like that
sappy, but the experience doesn't match.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it just sappy and kind of,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sappy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so at this point, I'm like,
that experience compared to, we know we
[SPEAKER_10]: added turps on top of this, and it's
getting sappy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny, because after you get a grape.
[SPEAKER_10]: That matches your expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a little bit more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a grape after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, very nice aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish we had just picked a true name,
because on its own, I really like the
[SPEAKER_10]: strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: When it's, you know, shouting it out isn't
getting us an international beef.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just trying to enjoy some turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's just tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does taste incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a mango orange fruit roll-up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got such a beautiful consistency to
it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes in so smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is just that refined.
[SPEAKER_10]: You pretty much, you can look at this,
and you go, well, if that's what I end up
[SPEAKER_10]: with when I drop the turp experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, obviously, the color of this final
product, before that process, is going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, you know, ooey gooey gooey good.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm looking, if I looked at this,
and I would literally say I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_10]: 60% yield by the time we took it,
taken it to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the more turps, that's one of the
things I know, the more turps,
[SPEAKER_10]: the more loss.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we would hope that somehow there would
be a balance between isolating turps or
[SPEAKER_10]: pulling turps away from material for a
process like this, and then seeing out
[SPEAKER_10]: where else could it be reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because obviously, if I don't pull the
turps, they'll come out burnt.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll come out reincluded in a way
that is not fun to dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I could pull these turps out and
keep them beautiful, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_10]: and make that process, there's a lot of
ultimate goals where we're literally like,
[SPEAKER_10]: this has still got too much flavor to make
that out of.
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we get this flavor out?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because even if it's later, it may help in
the orally, like being preserved in the
[SPEAKER_10]: pure smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sure hits nice off the sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must like it off the sick,
Horatio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know he's very particular on
what sort of surface that he hits it off
[SPEAKER_06]: of.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I was like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't think, you didn't have this
pipe last time I hit the sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, yeah, I just want this in
a smaller, more restricted experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the Taurus is the perfect
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's lighting up again.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's knife into some sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a nice, nice rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was your guys' first time hitting
LHL?
[SPEAKER_06]: First time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's got a nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what's interesting to me is the
first time I hit Horatio's LHL,
[SPEAKER_06]: now he's figured out, he's furthered his
refinement process since then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always and every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even when I first hit it, I was like,
oh, you know, I really taste that LHL,
[SPEAKER_06]: the D-limonade.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'd be like, okay, yeah, but like,
but tell me what you taste beyond that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, I didn't understand how
you could get stuck at that door.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I got to know him better and I went
in deeper and then he refined things
[SPEAKER_06]: deeper, I learned to taste these other
flavors, these almost minty, flowery
[SPEAKER_06]: flavors that are below that initial sort
of... Because someone mentioned it even on
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash Church or maybe it was just on a
Facebook post about the potential of the
[SPEAKER_06]: D-limonane as a solvent altering terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like that process as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no doubt about that something
going on in there is special.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a high sense of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sensitive in the same way that Horatio
is sensitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really deal with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really deal with, you know,
I don't even like to be around,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cigarette smoke or any sort of
things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the reasons I've always stayed
away from the hydrocarbons because I just
[SPEAKER_06]: don't trust that people know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I just don't trust that anyone's
even close to touching the research to
[SPEAKER_10]: know what... The thing is, I'm like,
look, you know I can do something with
[SPEAKER_10]: this, you know it's different,
but you know what's different?
[SPEAKER_10]: Trusting nature as anything that's going
to happen is going to be in line.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, we don't know anything about
trying the other route.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just know it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said it off camera, but it was a great
quote and you said, I self-taught myself
[SPEAKER_06]: all of this and I chose to do it with
something that wouldn't kill me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like self-teaching yourself with
butane is insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's insane and this is like, I'm not
calling out to people who are,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, this is their focus and their
passion right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking to the guys and the girls that
are watching right now, the youth that is
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for something to focus on.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would say to you is start with
something safer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get some bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big solventless quiver to be had
out there and, you know, there's ways to
[SPEAKER_06]: access these different resins that are
safer than potentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: blowing yourself up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about the people who've blown
themselves up and now see rosin and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're like, oh my god, where was this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the rosin is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where was this?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so much smoother and tastier,
I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a nice option for people that want to
experience dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think that the dry sift is too far
away or you're like, oh, I'm never going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be in a ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to go to this party tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, all right, well, grab some 25
micro on screen and your hair straightener
[SPEAKER_06]: and press on something.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_06]: A pound of bubble over there on the table?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can press some of that later.
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought a couple of rosin options.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Some seven star tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, some seven star.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going big, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going in the puking video.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got water in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can barely tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool to come and press that in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the thing is, as you start to,
just like anything, some of us have
[SPEAKER_10]: started to learn how to enjoy a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of us learned how to enjoy alcohol.
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't a, oh yeah, is that a bottle?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, I know this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, no, you literally tried to
reinforce.
[SPEAKER_10]: You told your brain, this is good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want this.
[SPEAKER_10]: My homies are doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you train yourself into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, with anything, especially if you're
coming from whatever you normally smoke,
[SPEAKER_10]: because I'm always coming from that's my
regular experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I try a hydrocarbon extract,
I'm like, whoa, is this how you rip up
[SPEAKER_10]: your chest every day?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I could see how in a week I could get
used to this because I smoke cigarettes
[SPEAKER_10]: and I know how that started.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to literally say how fucking
incredible that tasted.
[SPEAKER_06]: That tasted better than the LHL.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good thing I made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just like, well, here's the
thing about the LHL.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find the LHL to be a damn near like,
well, when he turns it into that,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like almost a shame to dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're dabbing for massive pain
relief or some sort of like instantaneous
pain relief.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that is the stuff that like
cures colon cancer and fucking shrinks
[SPEAKER_06]: tumors out of people's heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, that's the shit that you want to
access.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just found out you have a terminal
cancer, you really want to get some of
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the weirdest thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of, that's kind of why I'm
like, even when extracting this,
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm actually with this all the
pulling more than what the conventional
[SPEAKER_10]: thought of what you can get out of it is
extracted.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's carrying more potential when I go
this route.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I'm really excited about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a refinement.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I forget.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, it was somebody who was asking me
about a test of some really, really black
[SPEAKER_10]: trying to like, is it CBN?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this raw CBN?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were asking, you know,
do all the cannabinoids come over?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, there's these people,
they're seeing these unknown spikes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see these unknown spikes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And unless the client is interested in
furthering the research, you just,
[SPEAKER_10]: it just goes off as an unknown spike.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm expecting to find unknown spikes of
why it makes a success compared to the
[SPEAKER_10]: other routes that you can track.
[SPEAKER_10]: CO2 being a route, conventional
hydrocarbon being a route.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Terpsif just now dissipated in my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that flavor lasted so long and nice
out of the courts, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, I think that's the proper
route.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a full bong rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only one pin standing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just, you just knocked over the whole,
all the pins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me what turk that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the pineapple express.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same one we kept.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I guess this would be three month
cure or four month cure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went into pineapple express sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the luck of holding that sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nature knows what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the thing is I want to know that
these Terps are not even just a sift and
[SPEAKER_10]: we're all exploring strains to find out
what nature has to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I add this, I'm like,
now nature, what did you really have to
[SPEAKER_10]: say when we just stick to matching?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm enjoying watching Rick watch Ramone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm checking his reaction, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's tasty as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it literally, and you can tell
it's like, it's like you said,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's that it's that you literally,
you go, is this what live rosin would be?
[SPEAKER_10]: If I tried to, if I tried to, if you tried
to just basically stress, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: a live plant, would it taste like this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that what I was calling it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Live sift?
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I call it the first time you came
over here?
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was live sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have turk sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's turk sift and then I was
like P&W style, seven star.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we just go through the gammon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how long did that flavor last in your
mouth on your lips and shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it lasted for me, like, cause Horatio
was talking for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't want to interrupt, but I was
literally like, I can still fucking taste
[SPEAKER_06]: that shit in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a nice way, not in this sort of
overdone way where it's like, I just took
[SPEAKER_06]: a pierced turk drop and it's like,
that was a good ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he is Horatio.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that I can do is get a ratio
correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to.
[SPEAKER_06]: How fucking tasty is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Very.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little sift with turps, a little,
so we started out with the LHL.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice that it matches the same turps
as the sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's what this high that you're
experiencing right now is about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, yeah, I know I love P&W express,
but maybe the key to that strain is in the
[SPEAKER_10]: lost portion, not in the saved portion.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the point of, and then you find
out it's a whole different high than what
[SPEAKER_10]: it said in the booklet.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely a very nice high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Modulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to modulate while we're smacking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Modulate the modulation.
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't even gotten into.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to be modulating this.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, well, it's a whole, I haven't,
everyone's like, you smoking on the Tucci?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I believe I've had to get some
syringes done.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't play as much as people think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so we're going to try to get in this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cat wants to come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on in, Secura.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta let the cat in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to do a little bit of
playing and like.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 10 after one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice and late.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are getting terpy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about to get turped out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so nice to have a line of
motherships to hit everything out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: egg and the Taurus and the fucking.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the clear collection, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the clear collection.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, uh, I haven't really, I'm not much
for like a $20,000 pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I find already it's a pretty big
responsibility just to put 12 G's in
[SPEAKER_06]: pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to see the function as I'm
taking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't feel surprised.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I feel like we're going to,
we're going to first before going into
[SPEAKER_06]: modulating with some of the people at
home.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have half a click.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what he's talking about right
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see that that's just pretty
much white.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean white, look at it on the gold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Modulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Modulate the modulators.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is, this is an experiment that I
remember Skunkman Sam talking about years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pure THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pure cannabinoids modulating with
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the time they weren't all cannabis
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was buying just single terpenes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're terpenes are terpenes for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get them pure anyway,
these are good.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are good.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to see how it responds with
what you've already got in your system.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be specific as well and mention
that these terpenes are profiles of
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of them are pure fractions.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are all messages in themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, usually when everyone thought of,
oh yeah, well it's against them.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the point?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That totally went.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to like grab it, but I was like,
you know, why would you smoke straight
[SPEAKER_10]: THC?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, well, no one said that's all you
have to smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we didn't start this session just
hitting that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So with the turps that are already,
you know, a profile in your body,
[SPEAKER_10]: does this make the last experiment?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's come back in an intensity or is it
its own experiences?
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of that first question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really bad at describing flavors,
but hit that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I mean, the only thing I can say,
this process was taught to me by a
[SPEAKER_10]: analytical Mike is, um, there's no
chemicals to the process.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you, someone would go, well,
I've seen high, high, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: 99, a hundred percent THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, well, if the difference
between a hundred percent THC and 99% is
[SPEAKER_10]: another wash in a chromatography column
with petroleum ether, ether I'll pass.
[SPEAKER_10]: The discovery is about just high purity
THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, just like this is, it's not about
trying to get into a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_10]: because there should be a decent percent
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: 99 is good enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposed to be like fuel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it's boring.
[SPEAKER_10]: One dimensional, but, um, getting close
enough gives us a, an approximation of,
[SPEAKER_10]: like I said, put this through your current
high and then we'll start dabbling in,
[SPEAKER_10]: bringing back strange through,
um, a set amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just clean up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's in there now toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that sick factor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard you mentioned that, um,
come and come again, uh, factor out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it's like, it's not charring it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can actually, let's see what we got
going on here with these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to keep my, uh, keep from crossing my,
uh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's super slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you'll be able to hit that for the
next minute straight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find the sick, no matter how high I turn
it up, it just hits like a low temp.
[SPEAKER_10]: It refuses to degrade.
[SPEAKER_06]: It refuses to degrade.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I don't know how to describe the
effects of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was by no means overwhelming,
but it's definitely there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like in the back of my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, it's, it's, it's like I said,
it's single dimensional.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not comparing it to, is it the alter
ego to this being inactive?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's something totally different.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is like multi-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's multi-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny how you can dab it,
you can eat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The simplification seems to, yeah,
it is bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys hit it the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's such a nice THCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is like, so we just went from
like heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was before this was quite a heavy
impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very light and brings you back up.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I thought is this would bring
this, if the Terps would lead you in a
[SPEAKER_10]: sativa direction, it may only be low THC
that sends you down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's undimensionizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's like removing
dimension from the, from it, but it does,
[SPEAKER_06]: like he says, it brought it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of just made it more like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause this seems to be an energy dose
where this is like, yeah, this is like a
[SPEAKER_10]: balancing like, oh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great product for when you're
like filming a bubble man's world episode
[SPEAKER_06]: and you got to puff like say 11 rips with
D420K and the full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might want to take a hit of that
halfway through just to level out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great during cannabis cups where you're
testing and you want to come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost palate clearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was like a fruity, like a minty
toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I figured is this,
that mintiness that goes this way,
[SPEAKER_10]: unprocessed by heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where it starts out at.
[SPEAKER_10]: That should get you excited for more
session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Session booster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought if you have something in your
system, in your system, it goes sativa on
[SPEAKER_10]: you.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you just hit it on your own,
you're like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: I love sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So personally, like, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the, the heavy, the heavy is
nice for right before bed, but it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: ideal when you're filming an episode and
you're watching four guys and all of a
[SPEAKER_06]: sudden they're all sitting there like
heavy eyed and barely talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to be sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still just hitting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now let's pick a strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that we can modulate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to go down?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to feel heavy and then be brought
back up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even right now I'm, I'm, I'm up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to, I want to be brought back
down with the same shit turped.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snarf.
Snarf.
[SPEAKER_09]: Snarf.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that so funny?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that from?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I picture some weird dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throwback deep county.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's going to write in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, who loves snarf on thunder card no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
Wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we get into two words?
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't heard right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm, if you have something in your system,
it's, it becomes the module later.
[SPEAKER_10]: like you figure we could just hit some
turps and go in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take an ounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what everyone's going to write in
the comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take one too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what happens when you
re-administer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, wait, let's show them that.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks so nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science with Horatio.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got turps on one side and.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, that shit is white bomb.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so you got your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it presses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never considered it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if I could use an LHO filter and
just film right through it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what happens when we come out of
the press.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get turpy with it yet?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I put the turps against the wall.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, I see, I see.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's now we got some pressed cake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: So.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pressed cake it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I support that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been at it for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puffing tough, hitting bulls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not quite 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: See how that makes you feel when you go
that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the bioassay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, you know, when you're not sitting
in a lab with millions of dollars in
[SPEAKER_06]: scientific equipment, a bioassay is a
pretty damn accurate way to get the job
[SPEAKER_06]: done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't take long to know what you love.
[SPEAKER_06]: People can laugh.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, oh, you know, I love what
you guys are doing and all, but this whole
[SPEAKER_06]: sitting around and smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some data that tells me it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole sitting around smoking is how
we learn this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want the data too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're registering the turps so he can
register the taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you register the taste there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get some butter?
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely tasted that butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubba turped up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now was it, did it keep you up there or is
it more of a, are you still in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool thing about a bioassay too,
is it works different for different
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all different.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all have different endocannabinoid
systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I'm sure that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel it right here behind my eyes a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your one was like more up here in the
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was a profile of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, that's, yeah, that's basically
asking that Bubba, what do you have to say
[SPEAKER_10]: on the subtle end?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically increasing the THC of that
death of a.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the, you can, you can get
something consistent and go, okay,
[SPEAKER_10]: well with this part, how far do you go?
[SPEAKER_10]: We eventually go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked it when you poured it on top or,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was too much turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when we first hit it, this was my,
I'll let you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main thing I noticed was it was more
of a thick, thick head, more of a full
[SPEAKER_04]: head.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one was slightly, slightly more
light.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lighten just.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wispy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have so much stuff to talk
about tomorrow on a hash church.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the time right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash church is in like five hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: The hash church is in eight hours,
seven, seven hours and 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't sleep for much more than six
hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio is not sleeping at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going home to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you feel, yeah, if you saw a
notification on your Instagram,
[SPEAKER_10]: I stayed up tonight.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have something in mind that I really
want to get done, but this session is
[SPEAKER_10]: getting pretty good and started,
so I don't know where we'll end up if I
[SPEAKER_10]: can actually achieve it tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wonderful that you phoned me and had
this all happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought these guys were just going to
come over after having a day out in
[SPEAKER_06]: Adventureland and just, it was going to be
really kind of like not much happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next thing you know,
we were at a party introducing them to all
[SPEAKER_06]: these people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all of a sudden you're like,
I'm at your door.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look at my phone and it's like,
I missed five calls from my wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dope surprise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great surprise.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it because A,
I know how valuable your time is.
[SPEAKER_06]: B, you do not live close to me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you go on a visit with your bro
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Paris.
[SPEAKER_06]: He could go to the US and be there
quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many hours does it drive?
A couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full bubble day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth the trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: It completely increased the bubbling
factor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit melted into a liquid before,
but it didn't really bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turpenes bubble.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, with a simple bioassay and two
different abs, you know the truth forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when it comes to the type of reactions
you see.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually as Dr. Miles Chabon told me,
he's like, the turpenes are what lower the
[SPEAKER_10]: melting point and make it more violent and
unstable.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're really at real THC, it should be
a steady, non-violent reaction to the most
[SPEAKER_10]: part.
[SPEAKER_10]: Makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we see a little bit of turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very turpy heads up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grab me by my throat way more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's still got those turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pubic taste was a little less than I
thought it would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it would be more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely taste it on my lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely heavier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you done this before?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like hitting off the different sources
too, I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_06]: That silicon carbide nail is, that's a
serious must for the quiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can't really go home without that,
but I want to say I have to figure that
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to be hooked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys are good guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll sort you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use the old discount.
[SPEAKER_06]: My code this month, actually, for the rest
of the month is bubbleman420.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's at D-nail.com website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of your D-nail needs, you'll get a
discount with that code.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe they have the silicon
carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have two, so make sure you order the
proper one.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one that has a sapphire insert
that sits inside it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they have this one, which is just
the pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they got the under, the under
nail, what is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: The flat coil.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flat coil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other nail is, this one they mounted
on a piece of titanium for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the coil goes around and it's kind of a
unique silicon head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically super high in ceramic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely more heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I know because it's just
slowing me down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, do you want to step into the last,
we can step into some My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last sounds like it's almost over.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the last of this dimension.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll do another round?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, we're going through feelings.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, wait, we're guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just stick with feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I've got one feeling, dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Feeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to flip flop.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is a different feeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's smell this and see if we can
decipher what we think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Merrileaf drug cultivar now?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the research mystery.
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be another downer, but there's a
definite different purpose between a death
[SPEAKER_10]: bubba and an MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's both cushy, but so differently cushy.
[SPEAKER_06]: God, it's like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one really is like, that's something
right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a, I wish we could fraction
that and see it sitting in front of us in
[SPEAKER_06]: all the different things, because we'd be
able to smell it right at the end when you
[SPEAKER_06]: smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something that's sharp that goes
into your nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, as you're pulling it away,
it's almost like you don't get it when
[SPEAKER_06]: you're smelling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just as you start smelling it that
you're like, Oh, you get this little
[SPEAKER_06]: blast.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the terpene I want to know.
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes me so crazy is knowing these
are only the terpenes nobody smells once
[SPEAKER_10]: they get it back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'm like, no, all generation,
every pack.
[SPEAKER_10]: The growers know them, but usually some
growers dedicate themselves to one smell.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for instance, the train wreck grower,
he has a room of true train wreck.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he lives this profile to the point
where I'm like, are you serious?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just too strange to smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's like, this is the only thing I
need.
[SPEAKER_06]: The real terps, the real terps,
you have to, it's like, you can't smell
[SPEAKER_06]: them direct.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like an off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we started doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I ever saw them,
it was like you had to waft them.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what these are good for.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause this little thin line when you,
[SPEAKER_10]: I do worry about the plastic.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my first question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause this shouldn't be regular plastic.
[SPEAKER_10]: If this is a graded style.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the thing is this is just a
side.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm like, how could those terpenes are
caustic?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the pecs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see no degradation, no leaking of light.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I give you water and alcohol as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a special talk that doesn't break
down in like caustic materials.
[SPEAKER_06]: These normally have just like a rubber
grommet in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are proper talks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I suspect these are special.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it would be insane to be able to
create this and then be like, eh,
[SPEAKER_10]: these are just for samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfumes are essential oils and those
essential oils are terpenes and
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know those things have to go for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like we're pulling out pecs,
the first strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can tell everybody, we're learning
pretty much along with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're watching us learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how it's going, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I love about Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: The open dialogue is really breaking open
the ability for people to come up with
[SPEAKER_06]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trainwreck was also the highest yielding
turf.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have some... Do you want to show the
camera?
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if we're going to run out of THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're so going to run out of THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do a straight modulation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got this under control.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got this under control.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got this under control.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we even modulate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love when this happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has happened to me a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hold on.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we got so much to... All right,
you ready?
[SPEAKER_10]: Grab your rig.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just put... All right, just put that to
task.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, you got to wait for them to work
off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Close the deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Close the deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, it's opportune.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to watch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, we inadvertently jump straight
into turf modulation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we... Yeah, does everyone feel...
Yeah, we're buzzing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's buzzing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now we're not going to bump
this sea of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that would not be.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just turf soup, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: We could just grab a little bit of this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, did you purge that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, this is so purged, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I harvested this on day one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just drop that in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to update yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Purged.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pureed rack, is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we were supposed to modulate it with
some THC, but I guess we're just going to
[SPEAKER_10]: modulate the last hit with pure turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy how no vapor comes out,
but you can still taste that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy color in the middle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is illogical.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's going to be like, they're
wasting turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I bumped it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't scripted, people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to fit all these motherfuckers in.
[SPEAKER_07]: They keep leaning out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lean in.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you're up, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put my camera back down.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what's going for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all he's throwing in, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got nothing, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is for real.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not even going to carve it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to come back with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfume life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whispy tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, I didn't blow anything out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is like, we've got to come up with a
new word for more than loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the question is, that's saturated.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is saturated.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I just got out of a turp hot
tub.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't want your wife's table if it
leaves its boundaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry about the table, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, someone already messed it up with a
cup that they left on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not blaming anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever that was.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, obviously the train wreck has
got to cover a lot of something.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll press something into this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to put some bubble?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a bunch of bubble right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to do the honors?
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll start pressing that out to something
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you mean, like half a gram,
a gram, two grams?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_10]: For this much turps?
[SPEAKER_10]: It all depends on how loud you want to
move.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's up to you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you seeing how I'm just going to
approach this real quick, real quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't burn, and this is extra quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is powder.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Nice.
Whoa.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I wish I had the camera up close for
that, because that was insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says he wants one of those real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all going to have to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a great one, but I want to see
that on the camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tipping, tipping.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ready, sir?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're tipping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wait for it.
Oh my god, I missed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So much tipping.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's tripping, tipping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there's the cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tipping off, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hitting terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got modulated?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, swing it over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Modulating THCA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get this out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the THCA.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are in the modulators.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's tripping.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just dealing with excess resources,
capping.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just out of control.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right, all right,
all right.
Overloads.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Overload, overload.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now we can put that bubble in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just put a little care.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got an even better idea, because
since we're going to be supplementing,
[SPEAKER_10]: do you want to run this in silver haze or
a UVC key?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, just mop up some little
pineapple express.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, hold on, Ramon's going to mop
up some pineapple express.
That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You just called it, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing a mop up trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, for those of you that ever took
crystal LSD by the gram and turned it into
[SPEAKER_06]: liquid, and then maybe even took that
liquid and turned that into sheets,
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually, you had to clean all your
tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: And generally, when you cleaned all your
tools, it was called a mop up trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you clean all your vials.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, this is a mop up trip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the thing is, we smothered some pex
and turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we're crossing the line.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_10]: He had some pineapple express on the turp,
just pressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't we press it, just to press it,
to see what was going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's turped?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, all you have to do is make a
slight trip to the turperating.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's seven star right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just jumped to seven star, just by
taking a quick swim.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I got to say, these are not
the average terpenes that I'm used to
[SPEAKER_03]: tasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the real terpenes, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick, give the ratio some serious credit
for his work.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get in here, I think I'm cutting
myself out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going seven star?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I get it off the sink, or can I go
off the quartz?
[SPEAKER_05]: Whichever way you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I want to go quartz.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll just cut swabs of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just kill that off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch your head.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just trying to use the pressure on this
peeper.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're breaking off a few skins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a few skin flakes right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a better way to carve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a carb right there on the two,
so.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so now, we busted through a few
lines of modulation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you've already jumped into
pineapples.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was very tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: What statements do we have about just the
straight turks chasing up?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so exciting, and it's almost
hard to even.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might take me a week to really give you
an accurate description, but I'll say this
[SPEAKER_06]: much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exciting, it's fun, and it's
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not feeling down right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling buzzing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm buzzing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say, not in a coffee kind of
way, but more in just a sort of... The
[SPEAKER_06]: closest thing we get to it naturally,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like whatever this is, is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some positive modulation going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably shit they don't want us
to know about.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why it doesn't just jump out there
into the open field, because here comes
[SPEAKER_10]: the buddy with the fake modulators to just
try to jump in and get anything safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, no, this could be unsafe.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the plant I'm trusting that makes it
safe, that I'm only asking the plant to
[SPEAKER_10]: put the ratios together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I tell you, the few times when I
first started doing this with Tony,
[SPEAKER_06]: he was really the first person to pull out
the Pure Terps, I found that we were
[SPEAKER_06]: hitting too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even your Terps, Pure, didn't close my
lungs out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the funny thing, because I'm like,
okay, we're going hard, and I remember
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony saying, whoa, you're going hard,
and I'm like... Some of the Terps,
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony, had some crazy, powerful... He'd
take a little hit, and it was literally
[SPEAKER_06]: like...
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it's a different... Do you think it's
more of a concentration of the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: plant's profile?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sure smelt amazing, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Christ, the Jilly Bean, and... He had
three different flavors this one time,
[SPEAKER_06]: and each one were perfect representations
of what they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember being two meters across the
room, sitting in a chair across the room,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he came in the doorway, and he opened
it up, and he just went like...
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked at me in my eyes, and he just...
And then I just grinned back, and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, whoa, you got something special
right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, did it smell more like the dried
weed, or more like the weed grown,
[SPEAKER_10]: when it comes to being accurate?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hit one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because then we're finishing this
era of train mech.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hit one.
[SPEAKER_06]: New direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the same one I hit last time?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're just finishing the paper that
had the grand start.
[SPEAKER_10]: You hit it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to take this silver haze that
we're going to sublimate.
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks so cool when it came around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reload it with a little bit of footage.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we got some train wreck
silver haze set aside for...
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on at 1.40 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: What time?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the next move?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should pull the sublimator out
soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, pretty much it's... We got the
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still going to activate it,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that goes with the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to hit one activated?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's hit one activated before we
sublimate, and then I think that's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you like to hit the activated
through?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the standard sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sick?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the standard sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the mothership Taurus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super high-end ceramic, silicone carbide,
titanium hybrid nail, 20 mil t-nail whip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Corricot drop-down in the mothership
Taurus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I hadn't even considered now,
what if I had suited this... Okay,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, since you have tried this real
quick...
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the TURP to C activated?
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't try MKUltra.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know PAX, and we know My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I don't have much My Little Pony to
do much with, so you want to finish My
[SPEAKER_10]: Little Pony?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a hard time answering that question
when anyone says My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_10]: All I know is with one drop left,
this is the best way to split it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I come back, and it's just dried
up, and all of a sudden it does it for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get what I can get out of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give that a final smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's lit up some... Look at that
situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's pretty incredible because for
how late it is, I'm actually quite awake.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't usually stay up till two in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit, we're going to be paying
the piper tomorrow on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably feel completely normal and
just be my normal flat-lined vape dragon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to figure out how I'm going to set
up pastchurch tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to get that computer unplugged from
in there and put it out here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either at this table or that table,
so we will figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take this... I'll be up at
eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just dropped it right into the...
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're going to do what Devo says.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whip it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whip it good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't take much.
[SPEAKER_10]: It worked out real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be lucky if we get it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, it's nice how it stays.
[SPEAKER_08]: It did not take much.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's already enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how serious we take this shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put that to the test.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little pony, activated.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little NLP.
Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to sleep well tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right through pastchurch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wake up at like 12.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at my phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have like 800 messages.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_10]: The sublimator's still on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sublimator's on?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got it turned up to seven,
so it's in the green, not the red.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do low temp dabbing off the top
or we could just put herb in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just put her in the bowl?
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Herb in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just your good night... You said that just
fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, I heard it all mangled on
video.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, it's not going to go down good.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to sound like Earl in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I put Earl in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't deserve the term Earl,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put some herb in the bowl and put some
Earl in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give them Earl on top of the herb
rather than dab off the top because it is
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_10]: The double decker.
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing where you load the herb and then
you guys go tch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would give that the little thing out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a level of Earl, but a higher,
more purified... Yeah, and then you're
[SPEAKER_10]: mashing it with for my little pony.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I have such a nice appreciation for
it now because I've just been ignoring
[SPEAKER_06]: this whole oil scene for like 50 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think you'd grab it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so grippy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually not that bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny thing is it was burning me as I
was passing it to you and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's fine for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a no joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably will hit for like an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to just sit there and do you
know that time when no one's home and
[SPEAKER_10]: you're just going to choke out?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to just keep hitting it till
oblivion and where the ambulance wakes me
[SPEAKER_10]: up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to see how many rips I can get.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hold everyone in as long as I
can.
[SPEAKER_10]: My car cap is going to get to 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to top in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe you handed it to me that
way so I burnt myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first grabbed it, it was hot,
but then I just took like 11 hits of that
[SPEAKER_06]: and I can't even remember where it was
hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tapped it real quick so maybe tomorrow I
might feel it somewhere on my hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just find some turped out LHR and rub it
right back in and you're set.
[SPEAKER_01]: My shoulder was hurting and it stopped
hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit is pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your toes high.
[SPEAKER_10]: By then you guys will have heard the story
on Hash Church of how I put an axe in my
[SPEAKER_10]: foot and the only thing I could go for was
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I basically just hit it with iodine twice
and then caked it shut.
[SPEAKER_10]: With that in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stuck a bunch of LHR in your foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically it's a big open kerbass and you
feel a little bit of heat coming out of
[SPEAKER_10]: your finger and it was just trying to cap
the Grand Canyon with barrier pressure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just capped it and let it ooze.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was obviously working on one of these
things for tonight and I start to trip and
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only when you're on this orally you
realize how high you were from your foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: The number one thing was that without my
traditional sublingual terpenes and
[SPEAKER_10]: additives to pass the undertone barriers I
had no potential thought that the skin
[SPEAKER_10]: being more of a sublingual experience that
it could pass through.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't need a sublingual.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put that right into your body.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this passed through like the
sublingual would.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't need a liver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't you put it into a wound?
[SPEAKER_10]: I put it in a wound in my foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_10]: This passed through without a liver.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to send this through my
gastric system and I didn't have to add
[SPEAKER_10]: basically whatever terpene remainder is
qualifying as a sublingual barrier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Normally I use cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_06]: See this is what David Allen was talking a
little bit about on Hash Church some weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: or even months ago now, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: In regards to, you'll remember this
conversation about how he was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about getting it.
[SPEAKER_10]: He wanted an ester that you could apply to
the heart.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, you're going to use
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even like phytocannabinoids that you
were able to hook up to like if you go to
[SPEAKER_06]: the hospital and you just have a bag of
like saline solution that's filled with
[SPEAKER_06]: phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saturating the endocannabinoid system
right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like, there's a future in that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the fact that I'm like I didn't have
to use what I thought I needed as
[SPEAKER_10]: transports.
[SPEAKER_10]: For transdermal clothes on the surface you
need your other tools to get transdermal.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as soon as I was exposed to blood and
plasma and the actual system clearly you
[SPEAKER_10]: can't go from your foot to your liver
through your gut.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't swallow it and I didn't use my
subcheat.
[SPEAKER_10]: The terpenes that leaning has left me
qualify as direct.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think whatever it is, it's the
antiseptic quality and it's also the fact
[SPEAKER_10]: that it bypasses it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you're bleeding out,
but sometimes a liver is not available.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether it's your drunk, the fact that I
didn't have to eat it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought, oh well, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was taking a long time to go through
your liver.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took the exact same amount of time to
get high as it would if I ate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: An hour and 45 minutes and I was like,
oh my God, they're not going to get the
[SPEAKER_10]: sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to get the sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not going to be any sift tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm typing to my buddy and I'm like,
hey bro, words tough.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, melting.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I chose this for its pain relief THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't go to CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: Normally everyone thinks CBD inflammation
is everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some things are gone inflammation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some things are still acute pain trauma
and that was panic attack trauma.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I couldn't even sit on the foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Later I find out.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the fact that it went through at such
a level that I actually had to watch how
[SPEAKER_10]: much I fed my foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had given that to my wife,
she would have tripped, tripped.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm more amazed that it went through the
blood that way than anything I could have
[SPEAKER_10]: eaten or dabbed.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm very, very pleased with that new
paradigm and Tony will have a lot to say
[SPEAKER_10]: because he's gone the transdermal route.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I never knew if the problem line could
be used in an open wound situation where
[SPEAKER_10]: this being a distillate, you've kind of
already done your trial by fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as long as you don't dip your finger
in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's definitely helped open the capsules
and put it on skin and then the drops I've
[SPEAKER_06]: seen rub as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then they qualify as hypo something
right in the comments.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hypoallergenic?
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the hype.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one that literally says by virtue
of what I am, I cannot harm you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know the term for that quality
of skin product.
But.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just too stoned to really know
either.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hit one more hit at
Helichote.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hit some herb in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you got?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Congolese right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have this Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got another special strain that
you want to hit, you can hit that as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought Kima would bring this down,
but we're so up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, OK, how's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: That seems pretty up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you guys have been on the Congo
part.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in love with the Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the size that sublimates?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you crush it and you don't crush it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Full melt sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got full melt sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: So which one's this here?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an interesting Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it feel too sweet and candy-like?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm questioning growers their bud
candy and how much that can transfer.
[SPEAKER_10]: However you look at the sublimator,
you're the boss of your unit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I usually have a little grinder,
but let me see if it's right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me do the hand rub.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're
[SPEAKER_09]: just going back in on a lot of LHR.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's going to get all super hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my urban grower grinder.
[SPEAKER_06]: UG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, Remo gave me this years
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm talking some years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never used it, ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now that I'm back on my
sublimator here, it's quite nice to get
[SPEAKER_06]: back to the flavors of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: After going over to Remo's, that's kind of
when I was like, God, there is something
[SPEAKER_10]: that could.
[SPEAKER_10]: I even bought a base riser, and that's
good for the road, but for this kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: experience with the men's.
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting a nice grind pound and just
working through it, and now that we're at
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not many, anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: That seems to be the tone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we'll see about the high,
but it's not as crystal-y as a normal
[SPEAKER_10]: Silver Haze would be.
[SPEAKER_10]: So should I light this up or what?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the bear shit in the woods?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, from my dirt biking that I've done,
he mostly shits on the path.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was going to say, did you grind up
the train wreck bud?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I ground up just the little bud that
you just gave me.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so I did give you a new bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was going to say, the train wreck
will be shit-ton full of limonene.
[SPEAKER_10]: You said it was... No, no, it's new.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just started checking the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever that little bud was that you just
passed me by.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this is the new question.
[SPEAKER_10]: With all these growing methods and then
with all the confusion about genetics,
[SPEAKER_10]: every name strain just...
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't feel as hazy as a lot of... It
doesn't feel like Silver Haze as I know
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It definitely feels more candied
experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we need to do the
double-deckeries.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to do... What do you think?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hurt ribs?
[SPEAKER_10]: Straight?
[SPEAKER_10]: How'd you choke yourself out tonight?
[SPEAKER_06]: With that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: With this tiny little pinch of herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's not double-deck it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you kidding me, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: 50-50 hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, no, let's go my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's call me Skip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably it right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm feeling pulled upwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is that just the... How was the taste
on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get anything towards a burnty
taste?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not burnt, but this is maximum.
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be like 190... I'm going to go
down one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go down one.
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be about 195 on the... We were
at 70.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure the temp is
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take this guy out real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got him out and spilled my herb on the oil
slick, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what it's good for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have my arm over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to agree with you on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might have started out a little heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we hit the LHL at first,
and it was just kind of like... I was
[SPEAKER_06]: stumped.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, you hadn't puffed for a
while either.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's late, so I was kind of like a
little bit like, alright.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got that LHL.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, the whole thing you can lift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just lift the whole thing up because it's
herb.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise you have to pass vaping it.
Did the bomb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a huge rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Managed to not burn myself on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got plenty for the tats.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rich ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you hit one already?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I took over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a tiny bit more for him to hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the bud?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what flavor was that?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the... I'm going to put BC in front
of everything I do until we get to some
[SPEAKER_10]: true men with some true genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the BC Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that can't be... Silver Haze I've tried
in the past, and it can't be home state
[SPEAKER_10]: for you, Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's definitely like everything has
got a candy spin on the string.
[SPEAKER_10]: Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do feel uplifted.
[SPEAKER_10]: For whatever we're on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're modulating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Modulate the modulation of the modulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're modulating.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now you guys have been in BC how many
days now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three days?
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes to the types of hives you've
been on, how does this high feel compared
[SPEAKER_10]: to like, I don't know, you know,
when you usually leave a smoked out lounge
[SPEAKER_10]: or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you're suffering, is anybody
suffering for air?
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're smoking the shit out of my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I seen it like in so many other
scenarios, like even nails end up more
[SPEAKER_10]: dirty, but I'm not choking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like now you smoke all around the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Typically when you go into concentrate
sessions, do you walk out?
[SPEAKER_10]: With feeling like you left a plaque.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like weight, like some block of air.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I'm more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like I'll seize up even from the
foreground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different than... That might do it for me
to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise if it's good raisinal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a problem with the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even being in the same environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've experienced that a lot in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember in Barcelona?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy how many people I've been,
cause I've been with them burning it down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't smoke this weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause basically you are just modulating
your cigarette.
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole night is about how, are you
modulating your cigarette with hash?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it got a subtle berry flavor?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm modulating my cigarette with herb,
but that's how they approach the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's through the cigarette's eyes,
not through the medicine first as its
[SPEAKER_10]: primary.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been there and done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should do a double decker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it time?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been chatting away for about an hour
and you have shown us all sorts of fun,
[SPEAKER_06]: exciting things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So do you want to stick with the haze?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to switch to the chemo?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause obviously the Congo you want to
smoke straight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a little chemo we can... Yeah,
well I'll grind up some chemo and we can
[SPEAKER_06]: do double decker.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is super fishy.
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife hates the vape smell mask.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super cushy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this called?
[SPEAKER_05]: UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good cush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't expect to see that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't expect to see this in Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a UG certified grinder with UG
certified cush.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have this cut out on my deck.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not even smelling that grinder when
it comes up correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's original.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pass that down.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is just fire, fire, fire,
fuego.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's that from?
[SPEAKER_10]: Urban Grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his favorite.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a friend sick enough that I need to
know if this strain has the magic.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like well let's find out.
[SPEAKER_10]: By making sure we get you the strongest
turp profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he was very kind enough to share
that cut with me about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a special cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shared it with some friends as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Remo could have taken that cut and blown
it and bred it and sold it as Remo's push.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he was happy to share it with
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you find that when people don't breed
something they just actually try to grow
[SPEAKER_10]: it to it almost back to if it was a land
race it's version of its land race
[SPEAKER_10]: experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it as cushy as UBC can get through
learning the plant versus just running out
[SPEAKER_10]: and trying to oh you know what this needs
it just needs a little dash of this strain
[SPEAKER_10]: and that'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little dash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of learning if you should have
grown it with a better light so you get
[SPEAKER_10]: more mercy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so there's your double decker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can feel that body lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we're ninjaing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninja in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Double decker and cushion it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we lowered that 10.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we'll know how high we are when we
see, when I go on Bubble Bear and go down
[SPEAKER_10]: like 159 minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: How long are we smoking?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's no edge.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you find a cut when we're two
spaced out and loading up the next one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I got this for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was nice, eh?
Incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's next?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ramon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramon, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you go that way?
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you kind of hold onto that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put that down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just lift up the wand Horatio.
[SPEAKER_06]: After about five seconds or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can kind of drop it back in as he
clears it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pushed the herb down so it's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could probably get another hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to hit it again, sir?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the oil is hitting for sure and I
bet you the herb will hit again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once it starts getting milky just pull
the wand out again.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had looked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like... Well, it's been a while
since we...
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, we got two more reps left.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since I got this high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Milk's your star.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a serious, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some real deal holy feel right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get some man's over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get a full... You want to fade
it back?
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to warm up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That herb, put it to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people mash oil into flowers and I'm
like, I don't know how you live that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You put my whole week's worth of dabs in
the smoke and you're smoking it at hot
[SPEAKER_10]: dabs the whole way.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not driving.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I got to bring you down,
chemo down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we're twitching now trying to get
the dabber up these days.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'm going to start hitting until he
goes back around two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big,
[SPEAKER_03]: big, big, big up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really recall ever getting this
high before.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why it's the modulating arts.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can go places and somehow we're all
feeling like... Even I don't even feel
[SPEAKER_10]: like I sessioned out like crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know how you normally feel
like at the end you're supposed to say
[SPEAKER_10]: you're high, but you really mean stoned?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, no, my head feels like neener,
neener, neener.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to do it, put it on the block
and kick some garbage cans and see what's
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take those dirt bikes off the back
of my truck.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, someone's going to have to
watch this video back and comment which
[SPEAKER_10]: modulation do you think turned us back
into teenagers?
[SPEAKER_10]: At which point did it break?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it when we all started drinking
trainwreck?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is for me, but hold on, I got a...
Where's my herb?
[SPEAKER_10]: The trainwreck shots.
[SPEAKER_09]: The trainwreck shots.
[SPEAKER_09]: The trainwreck... I pushed so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can lift the whole thing up if you
want.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just didn't want to get back on the
cover.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like being able to pick up the whole
pipe and sort of handle it the way I want.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: That cush is all over.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one that puts me on the new
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm entering into whatever competition
it's the first prize.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take some of this and apply myself
and get myself...
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that cush is UBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certified.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really good right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another way to cap off the night with some
flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a few minutes after 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: We rocked out a good solid hour with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio, super pleasure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You killed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two extra days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you were coming back tomorrow
morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be hard to be at Hash Church
without those churchs and without you,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we'll see you on Hash Church tomorrow
morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, will this come on after Hash
Church?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe, unless I just stay up all
night and put it on.
[SPEAKER_10]: It all depends because it's just one long
session.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: In elements.
Play that music.
Awesome.
Well, yeah, that was fun.
Thank you for watching.
Welcome to the world.
Thanks for watching.
Peace.
Cheers.
Yeah, that's it.
Cheers.
Cheers.
