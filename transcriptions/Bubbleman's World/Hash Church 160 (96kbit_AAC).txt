[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World and welcome
to Hash Church episode 160.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually had to go back a couple of
times and look at that because I thought,
[SPEAKER_11]: wow, 160.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get confused with the wake and bakes and
the hash churches, but everyone,
[SPEAKER_11]: welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you're having a great day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to the show that we have
ready for you today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to send out my link so I can get
Monsieur Etienne into the room and all my
[SPEAKER_11]: other good friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will send out the email as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, for those of you that have been
paying attention, today is the day that we
[SPEAKER_11]: were going to have Jeremy on from Build a
Soil and Peter on from Soil Balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a little bit of drama that
occurred online.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just want to clear all that up and
have a nice little conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's my brother from another
mother.
[SPEAKER_11]: First in, as always, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, my friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are things?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, things are pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm feeling lovely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to squish some of that Where Is My
Bike the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got a 30% yield.
[SPEAKER_12]: And look at that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: 30% yield.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a squisher, huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only that, it's haze through and
through this Where Is My Bike.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's terpenaline and pining and
d-limonene.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so rich in these terpenes that it
seems to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get cat mouth just smelling it,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first smelled it, it reminded me of
like Soma's place in like 97.
[SPEAKER_11]: 98.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that might have been.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if he was still in the same
place.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember he moved way back when.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think he moved right around 97,
98.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then moved over to the Faisalgrat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that's so.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: Morning, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: After the morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that sound right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Soma's near the Faisalgrat, isn't he?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm terrible with streets names,
even though I've lived here for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know how to get everywhere, but I don't
know what freaking street it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like Mark Rose, who lives in
Kathmandu for 27 years and never learns
[SPEAKER_11]: the language.
[SPEAKER_12]: It says Straat at the end of the street.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I want to welcome Jeremy into the
room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to mute your mic there, Jeremy,
just when you're not talking, because
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a bit of a reverb reverberation,
but Jeremy from Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, unmuted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope the Internet's acceptable here in
my office.
[SPEAKER_02]: The keys are in my office.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a wedding last night,
so everybody that works for me was out
[SPEAKER_02]: having a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I decided to do it for my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're coming through perfectly.
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as everyone keeps their mics muted
when each person is talking, we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: have that reverberation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also able to mute mics, so that's not
too big of a problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Peter just came in from Soil
Balance and he has a lovely guest with
[SPEAKER_11]: him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for having us, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, Hash Church today is part of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Today is we got we got both Jeremy from
Build a Soil and we got Peter and guest
[SPEAKER_11]: from Soil Balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to thank both of you guys for
coming in today.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really cool thing when sort of,
you know, you can have this sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: experience that happens out in social
media.
[SPEAKER_11]: Out on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook or
all these things.
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of got a little heated there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought, man, I really want to be
able to bring these guys in and get this
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation sorted out so everyone can be
on the same page.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really want to thank both of you
guys for for coming in and being willing
[SPEAKER_11]: to do that, especially in this day and age
where, you know, people might be a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bit freaked out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh, no, there's disagreement in
the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we thrive on disagreement here in
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's, you know, apples and apples
is less than apples and oranges.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's my metaphor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the I'm all about the quiver in
this day and age of information.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm happy to have both sides here on on
in Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we can have a great little
conversation in regards to, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: in regards to both what you guys are both
doing, because I thought maybe a good idea
[SPEAKER_11]: would be to maybe have Jeremy give us a
little background on Build a Soil and let
[SPEAKER_11]: us know what he's been up to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we could start the discussion in
regards to, you know, some of the I guess
[SPEAKER_11]: I would call it dramas that occurred in
the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you want to also maybe introduce your
guest, Peter?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: And real quick, this is the first time
that I've gotten to speak with Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_18]: So hello, it's a pleasure to meet you and
speak with you in person.
[SPEAKER_18]: So and I and I know, Jeremy, that you've
got quite a few questions for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the reason actually, everybody for me
being here today, is because I'm looking
[SPEAKER_18]: forward to answering all of them,
giving you and our audience the clarity.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for making the time to speak
to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And real quick, if it's OK, Shannon,
before I before I introduce you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I just I just wanted to say one
thing really briefly.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to share a few things with with
you about about this whole situation.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been pretty tough on me, my whole
team.
[SPEAKER_18]: With what's been going on.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I've actually been able to realize
that this whole thing is has really been
[SPEAKER_18]: kind of a blessing for us.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Jeremy, you took the time to,
you know, protect the growers that you
[SPEAKER_18]: represent and point out and ask questions
on all of the content on our site that is
[SPEAKER_18]: confusing or that could be looked at as
misleading, calling us out on that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, so you ask the hard questions,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do respect that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And and our our goal real quick,
you know, as a company is to constantly
[SPEAKER_18]: improve ourselves and become a better
company for this industry and our growers.
[SPEAKER_18]: So so so I do appreciate where he was
coming from on that, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also did some research on his
company.
[SPEAKER_18]: And honestly, you know, I'm very grateful
that there are companies like his that you
[SPEAKER_18]: know, that have been working so hard to
propel organic, no till sustainable
[SPEAKER_18]: cultivation methodologies.
[SPEAKER_18]: So so I honor the work, you know,
that that he's doing.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been doing it for about 20 years and
I know how hard it is.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can personally relate to to how,
you know, he wants to to protect his
[SPEAKER_18]: clients.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have I have no anger towards you,
Jeremy, or the way that you've done
[SPEAKER_18]: things.
[SPEAKER_18]: I respect you for your work and the things
that you're doing for the industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: So on a serious level, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And Shannon, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to say that I want this is
Shannon way.
[SPEAKER_18]: She's in charge of our company's public
statements and PRS.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're both going to pretty much like
take notes and try to learn as much as we
[SPEAKER_18]: can from this business meeting.
[SPEAKER_18]: So so the first thing we're curious about
is Jeremy's thoughts on the white paper
[SPEAKER_18]: that we put out after we hear,
of course, about him and his company.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, and just before Jeremy starts,
what I wanted to let everyone know that I
[SPEAKER_11]: had never heard of Jeremy or build a soil
before.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's a lot of people in the
community that I haven't heard about.
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing I'll really say about Jeremy
is he had an incredible group of people
[SPEAKER_11]: backing him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy may have come across aggressive,
but that's because he's looking out for
[SPEAKER_11]: us.
[SPEAKER_11]: He always has been looking out for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And man, people had great fucking things
to say about you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's why I felt like, you know what,
if this guy is the way people are saying
[SPEAKER_11]: he is, then we're going to have we're
going to be able to have a great
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So go ahead, Jeremy, and give yourself a
little introduction there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us about your company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And okay, yeah, my name is Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that don't know,
build a soil is a website that started
[SPEAKER_02]: actually right here in my kitchen,
and just kind of got built from the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really what set us apart as unique
from day one is we didn't open the same
[SPEAKER_02]: catalog that everyone else had to
distribute products from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while we're not a manufacturer,
like like their product is, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: reach out to other manufacturers that had
the same goals with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realized right away, they were hard
to find because they didn't have huge
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing budgets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were aligned with major agronomy or
farming outside of our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there was just really hard to find them
in one place where shipping was an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So build a soil was born to solve the
issue of sourcing quality organic
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients or ingredients for no till and
for that type of farming, and then putting
[SPEAKER_02]: them in one place where we could start to
combine the shipping bundle and lower that
[SPEAKER_02]: burden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since then, it's been really
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been able to look at a ton of
different I actually looked at soil
[SPEAKER_02]: balance pro from kind of not perspective
to bring it on for build a soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't pay too much attention
because we have a number of other
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my rules is I don't want to
confuse my customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to offer every product
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to offer ones that we have personal
experience with and we can translate that
[SPEAKER_02]: to our customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that being said, it got to the
point where we started to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about soil balance pro because
they were doing a very good job getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at that point, in my opinion,
the way the universe works is that when
[SPEAKER_02]: you hear about things multiple times,
kind of like a sign to start doing more
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will totally admit from my end,
it was like a series of events where I was
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely excited because I kind of
pulled on a thread and it started to come
[SPEAKER_02]: loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that hadn't happened before,
at least when I started researching
[SPEAKER_02]: products and the way this happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just like I normally do do things
in the spur of the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the way that all the
information will be portrayed here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a list of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't prepare for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to come have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nice to meet you before this
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so none of this was personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that he totally understands that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so coming from the perspective purely
of what's good for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are by no means the watchdog of the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of other products that
were probably maybe even better in line in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of soil balance to deserve this type
of attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: But soil balance in particular had very
good marketing reference in university
[SPEAKER_02]: studies that, in my opinion, gave it
supreme leverage to bypass some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: vetting industry does through the
seniority of who's been around a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time, who's proven their products work the
way our community normally adopts
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've seen so many products come
that now we're all looking for scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Community is shifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're really hoping for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel a lot of this conversation
started because they had that evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: that allowed them to jump ahead of the
pack, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're finding that some of that
may have been misleading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it may have been inaccurately
portrayed and now maybe more accurately
[SPEAKER_02]: portrayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to get to the bottom of all of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go through all the questions that
have already been kind of posted out there
[SPEAKER_02]: and anything new that maybe users have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, I kind of like to see
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing everybody knows and is up to
speed with where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everybody have an idea?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be four or 500 people
watching and maybe some thousands over the
[SPEAKER_11]: course of the next week.
[SPEAKER_11]: So probably it's not a bad idea to go over
it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just go over the threats you pulled,
mention each little thing, and then we can
[SPEAKER_02]: create the discussion back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pull up my Instagram really quick
because it'll help me on my end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go play them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go through each little
thing because obviously some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things have come to light that some of
them were different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The MSDS has changed, a few things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll go through with where it started
and where I was at.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been talk about maybe losing a
sale, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually several times where
this got brought up, but not in really a
[SPEAKER_02]: sales fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more in, hey Jeremy, I'd like some
information about this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that across the board because a
lot of times we want people to source more
[SPEAKER_02]: regionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then we had another aspect where we
had a consultant that behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_02]: was asking about soil balance program in
particular because they may be working in
[SPEAKER_02]: a group, be on the line and they had not
used this product before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started to do some more due diligence
than I normally would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where these things started to
come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so normally I just go and jump and I
look at the MSDS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that that is 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times there's no information to
be found.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do more digging.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I just went to his website or to your
product's website, found the MSDS,
[SPEAKER_02]: printed it out and went, oh my goodness,
this is very different than what I've
[SPEAKER_02]: heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right away I think it got me
excited in the sense of there may be more
[SPEAKER_02]: to it than I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we can all have that feeling
when our gut feels a certain way and then
[SPEAKER_02]: a fact comes in line with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to admit that maybe I was
excited that I was right, but it's human
[SPEAKER_02]: nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking, my goodness,
MSDS is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I shared that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times what happens is the
truth will come out right after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find that either the MSDS was
accurate, it was a whole product,
[SPEAKER_02]: products had been removed, whatever the
case was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you guys can see that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the MSDS that was listed on the
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later on maybe we'll get into how that
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that catalyzed the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then from there, as doing due diligence,
I just started dialing numbers for the
[SPEAKER_02]: university studies that were reported.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're being listed as university
trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also don't seem to appear in such
a white paper fashion the way they're
[SPEAKER_02]: listed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dr. Smiley, he was the one that I
called first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way the universe works,
sometimes when you're in that flow,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are the things that line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he called me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of the others have called me
back, nearly as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Communication has not been as easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was interested that his name was being
used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then we were talking about the
timeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that we got more of the
university trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I was going to call everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started calling them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on we found out something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got an email back from Dr.
Smiley, kind of confirming that he had not
[SPEAKER_02]: been part of the trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it couldn't happen because he
hadn't been there for 32 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time they started to dig and find
out, OK, Eric Nelson was working there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The story started to come together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually we got to the fact that I got
an answer back about it may have been a
[SPEAKER_02]: student who worked for Dr. Smiley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then we got a letter back from Dr.
Smiley saying that was not possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't have any undergraduate students
working for him when he left in 1985,
[SPEAKER_02]: nor during any time after that period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that led us to, it was definitely
solidifying that at least this one trial
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as that started to happen,
we lost trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we started to scrutinize things we
may not have scrutinized so much,
[SPEAKER_02]: where there was terpene analysis reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I clicked on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The percentage math-wise was probably
accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the percentage that we talked about
was they compared a very low percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they showed an increase in
quality using their product with a still
[SPEAKER_02]: very low terpene number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so after that came out, they said that
was a home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was a little bit concerned with
the fact we thought maybe there was some
[SPEAKER_02]: professional testing done on the product
instead of just on the home grower level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all in all, you can see how this
story followed through on our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch the videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we'll get into some more
specifics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what everybody's interested
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the basic story to where we're
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're both together here on
HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information regarding
university trials, terpene data,
[SPEAKER_02]: MSDS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we can just hit on the high
points that the customers might be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in, get the heart of the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I notice on your website a lot of things
has changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think had your website been the way it
is now, when I first started doing my due
[SPEAKER_02]: diligence, it would have been a dead end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would have recommended that they
just try the product and see what their
[SPEAKER_02]: results are, what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we looked further into some of the
bacteria that are listed on the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to talk about that,
see if that's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've heard some claims about all of
the material in there, colonizing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty clear from the label that
there's a number of them that just won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to talk a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think everyone's up to speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bubble man, if you want to kind of take
it to that next step, I'm ready to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I'll give my perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: I woke up one day, I had a kind of a
unique race horse in the race because it
[SPEAKER_11]: was, I had brought people Peter into the
community and shared my platform with
[SPEAKER_11]: them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I saw the post, I didn't even
really see what you had said.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, I didn't really like it was a
quick sort of Instagram thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been on the internet for 25 plus
years doing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've kind of learned over the years
ways to go about it ways not to go about
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just immediately saw people
attacking Peter's character.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was hurt by it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, Whoa, like, just a second,
like, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, why are people attacking Peter?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, he just came on to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, Oh, my gosh, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe those guys would do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just thought there must be a
misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, he seems like such a good dude is
the world really this fucked up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then and then I was like, Well,
maybe the web guy made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been dealing with a web guy for two
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't believe how borderline,
you know, brain damage they are,
[SPEAKER_11]: in a sense, sometimes the things that get
put on my website, are literally the
[SPEAKER_11]: opposite things of what I would have on my
website.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of my own fault for being so
distant from that component of my
[SPEAKER_11]: business.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm involved in a lot of components of
my business.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I thought, I was like, maybe they
made a mistake on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I called him up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was like, Oh, yeah, there's this
and that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a student.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did there was a mistake on the
website.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we changed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everyone thinks we're hiding now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, Oh, my God, this is a crazy
catch 22.
[SPEAKER_11]: The internet is a dangerous place.
[SPEAKER_11]: As you well know, people love to choose
sides, even when just solid information
[SPEAKER_11]: might be getting shared.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was blown away at how many people were
like, loading the guns, lighting the tiki
[SPEAKER_11]: torches.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just like, well, our community needs
to slow down just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And because, you know, for me,
I haven't used soil balance, I have never
[SPEAKER_11]: received like payment or sponsorship or
money from them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just invited Peter in as a guy that I
felt like I related to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And funny enough, I feel like I relate to
you as well, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_11]: The most of the things you said at the
start, we only want to sell products that
[SPEAKER_11]: we ourselves know work.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's what I've been doing for 20
plus years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of the things that you said in
regards to how you go about doing things
[SPEAKER_11]: is very much the way I myself go about
doing things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I kind of see this as a unique
opportunity for us to kind of obviously
[SPEAKER_11]: show all the information, get everything
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's still people in chat right now
going, Oh, it's all fake advertising.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got this world now with Donald
Trump and media and the way it all plays
[SPEAKER_11]: out that we all owe ourselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a big responsibility to one
another in a sense in how we react.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can respect that you were in the
moment because I felt that I felt that
[SPEAKER_11]: when I watched your little videos and you
were like, Oh, my God, it just keeps going
[SPEAKER_11]: deeper.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I could see how those key things would
easily, easily make you believe those
[SPEAKER_11]: things.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm glad that we could come come out
onto the chat room and sort of open it up
[SPEAKER_11]: as a discussion, even if it turns out that
it is all, you know, whatever the end
[SPEAKER_11]: result, I just think that a real
discussion between the actual people is
[SPEAKER_11]: more important and less damaging than
allowing for, I don't want to say social
[SPEAKER_11]: poisoning, but definitely manipulated
assumption, which is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_11]: anything that anyone's, you know,
we all do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all do manipulated assumption on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that it makes us evil
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, here's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B's been hooking up these people
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been helping these guys with the
Irwin clamp.
[SPEAKER_11]: He gave me one.
[SPEAKER_11]: He gave a bunch of different people one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he gave one to Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_11]: Breeder Steve posted it the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, Oh, I love Johnny B's new
product, manipulated assumption
[SPEAKER_11]: accidental.
[SPEAKER_11]: But Johnny B forgot to mention that this
is someone else's product.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so he got the props from Breeder Steve
and the guy who actually invented the
[SPEAKER_11]: product didn't actually get the and now
John doesn't do that because he's evil.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a mistake and we all fall victim to
this manipulated assumption.
[SPEAKER_11]: And from my perspective, we really need to
be careful with the Internet because it's
[SPEAKER_11]: so easy to lead people, to lead people to
something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, online as well, if you've
been dealing with customers for a long
[SPEAKER_11]: time, it seems like the ones who are angry
are willing to go out of their way to
[SPEAKER_11]: destroy companies and to destroy people
more so than when we just are able to be
[SPEAKER_11]: like, okay, well, let's sit down and have
a conversation about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've personally been embroiled in
lawsuits for patents in this industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been I've been socially poisoned by
different people who I've who've become
[SPEAKER_11]: business partners and friends in the end,
because I know I can see how when the two
[SPEAKER_11]: groups stay apart, it can just and it's
it's often not even the two groups.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the people around those two groups
that love those people that go to war for
[SPEAKER_11]: those people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they start defending in a way that is
really, truly social poisoning.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's destructive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not going to help any of our of
the patients or customers that are out
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really do appreciate both of you for
coming on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was super surprised when both of you
guys were just like, yeah, of course,
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll come on Ash Church and talk,
dude, I have nothing to hide.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like and so I just I guess I'd pass it
over to Peter if you wanted to mention you
[SPEAKER_11]: talked about the white paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not exactly sure what that is.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, well, dude, thanks for giving us
the platform to come and talk about these
[SPEAKER_18]: things, because that's just what we
wanted.
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't been really ever asked about.
[SPEAKER_18]: Any of this stuff, it's been more just
that social paradigm shift that the
[SPEAKER_18]: supporters are trying to find the truth.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we really appreciate you giving us the
opportunity to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So so, yeah, one thing I will just kind of
go back to, which was the MSDS.
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing that I'm grateful to Jeremy
for is that we we did upload the incorrect
[SPEAKER_18]: MSDS.
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of our scientists sent it into us
from another product that they were
[SPEAKER_18]: working on and it did have some some
synthetic ingredients that was loaded onto
[SPEAKER_18]: our site.
[SPEAKER_18]: Jeremy found it and we were like,
holy shit, that that shouldn't be on
[SPEAKER_18]: there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Why is that even on there?
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I can see how that would
lead to the hype.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, hey, man, it's not in the
product, but it's on the MSDS.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, we made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we we were about seven months
into the industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to do a good job.
[SPEAKER_18]: We uploaded a ton of information pretty
quickly to build the site.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shannon and I worked on it together.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's one of the reasons she's here.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we put a lot of stuff on real quick.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we made a mistake by putting up a bad
MSDS.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was sent to us in good faith.
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't double check it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so we I called in that morning and
actually asked about the MSDS before I
[SPEAKER_02]: posted this to give you guys a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called in and I went to the
technical support team and I asked them
[SPEAKER_02]: why I said that I wanted to run a trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was curious in making the trial
fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at the MSDS and I found all
of these ingredients and I read them back
[SPEAKER_02]: and I said, is there a lot of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a small amount?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I add some of these ingredients to
my trial on the other side and fair trial?
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, your customer service
department either wasn't or was ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: make up an answer very swiftly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they without skipping a step that they
were just trace amounts of all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to feed the microbes as an initial
microbe of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that to me was enough proof saying,
hey, I called the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked about the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The MSDS is listed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other opportunity could I give them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not knowing Peter maybe was the person I
should have talked to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I'm in a situation where
immediately was changed and I'm thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is this changing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see that this was not a
manipulated assumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was black and white and I was sharing
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't mean your manipulated
assumption.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just mean like the people who the people
who love and trust you were so quick to
[SPEAKER_11]: just I mean, I read everything you said
and I was like, OK, well, let's just let's
[SPEAKER_11]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: No one else needed to check shit out.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were on the ball.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were like they were good to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were just like, all right,
let's burn this fucking company to the
[SPEAKER_11]: ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's fucking and so that I love that part
frightened me because, of course,
[SPEAKER_11]: it should frighten you as well,
because we both own companies and the idea
[SPEAKER_11]: of like and I and I'm fallible.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm human.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've made all sorts of mistakes in my
life.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if people start calling me out for my
mistakes, like I'm actually and I and I've
[SPEAKER_11]: had it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want you want to know what happened
with me?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you a funny story.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started bubble bags a couple of months
after Mila Jensen started the Isolator Bag
[SPEAKER_11]: Company.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wasn't the first.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was second.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I took so much slack because of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an unbelievable starting the bubble
bag company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Second was was was quite something.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now check this out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had two cats at the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a cat named Dutch.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a Maine coon and I had a cat named
Tripper.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my email at the time was Dutch Tripper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, someone who loved Mila because Mila
owned a psychedelic shop and was Dutch and
[SPEAKER_11]: was a tripper figured I was stealing her
like name like I was the Dutch tripper.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's trying to make it seem like he's
Mila.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, dude, I can promise you the last
thing on the whole world I wanted people
[SPEAKER_11]: to think was that I was coming across as
Mila.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the reason I called it bubble hash
and stayed away from Isolator.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't call it bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind, 20 years ago when I called
it bubble hash, there was no hype train
[SPEAKER_11]: for people to name things so they could
own it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_11]: That happened after the term bubble hash
came out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly didn't name it because I
wanted to own it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to distinguish myself differently
from a product that already existed that I
[SPEAKER_11]: knew I was going to be taking massive flak
as the copier.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if you look back at the history,
not only did I copy it, I destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I made it so much better and it worked out
for the customer.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it ended up being a good thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But why did people think I was fucking
with Mila just because my email address
[SPEAKER_11]: was Dutch Tripper at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see these weird little things
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't trying to fuck with Mila like
honestly and the only cannabis cup back
[SPEAKER_11]: then the only event in all of the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Was in Amsterdam was in her backyard.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can only imagine from my
perspective, man, those were uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_11]: years at my booth where people would come
up to me from her her booth and threaten
[SPEAKER_11]: me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were doing it out of love.
[SPEAKER_11]: They loved her and they wanted to come
over to me and tell me I love Mila and I
[SPEAKER_11]: will smash your face.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one guy threatened me with a hockey
stick at the milk bag, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: over over water hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the fact that you guys are both sitting
here right now and having a nice
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation, I and the chat room also
really appreciates your maturity on all
[SPEAKER_11]: these levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter being able to accept what's being
told to him, acknowledging that the MSDS
[SPEAKER_11]: sheet was wrong, not for, you know,
a purpose of like to manipulate and lie,
[SPEAKER_11]: but being shown and being called out
immediately, it gets changed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, one of the funny things I saw about
that was they changed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I saw a bunch of people going,
they're trying to hide it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, well, no, you pointed it out
that it was wrong and they changed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's it's such a crazy situation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they should have given more credit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to thank Jeremy for pointing this
out, as Peter did when he came into the
[SPEAKER_11]: room, which to me was a big boy thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's got to be hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank someone for pointing out something
in a way that for sure you weren't overly
[SPEAKER_11]: stoked about.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, he swallowed that
and he said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: We we made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now she's taking notes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Calling customer service.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we need to make sure our customer
service isn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying to better things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact of the matter is,
Jeremy, you're helping.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I hats off to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as the MSDS goes, like,
thank you for that, Jeremy, because and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take full responsibility for that one
for switching it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, after the fact, I realized
that we probably should have put a press
[SPEAKER_08]: release out to that just for the industry
as a whole to know that we made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at that point, I didn't realize that
there was so much hype.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize that it was such a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I will definitely take the fall on
that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you also didn't understand the depth
of the hype that people or how seriously
[SPEAKER_12]: people take your product.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this makes you aware of how
seriously the marketplace takes your
[SPEAKER_12]: product and wants to see it move forward
as a proper product, because nobody wants
[SPEAKER_12]: shit product.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody wants chemicals that were listed.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I had problems back when I had a
cycling team.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a supplement company put illegal
supplements into riding supplements for
[SPEAKER_12]: actual cyclists.
[SPEAKER_12]: And cyclists failed, didn't go to the
Olympics because of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, so this happens across the board in
all types of industries, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_12]: people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's cruised over many people.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I commend also Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for allowing the platform so
that this discussion could happen so that
[SPEAKER_12]: the trolls and everybody else can see that
it didn't come from a place of evil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It came from a place of trying to do the
right thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of that, you know, thankfully,
you have this wise consumers, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: like build a soil that are actually
keeping their eye out on things to make
[SPEAKER_12]: sure that they're not getting ripped off
so that you're not getting ripped off.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it all came from genuine care from all
points.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for being responsible adults
and discussing it and bringing it to,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, an understanding that people can
see that it is what it is for what it is
[SPEAKER_12]: and that for some, you know, fallacy that
it isn't.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: For that sentiment, I did want to also
talk a little bit about we worked really
[SPEAKER_18]: hard for the last like week with with our
doctor, Brock, to try and because there
[SPEAKER_18]: was a lot of questions about the white or
university results on our website,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, especially after what Jeremy
found out with regards to talking to Dr.
[SPEAKER_18]: Smiley.
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we did was we we we took all the
original test results that were sent to us
[SPEAKER_18]: by Dr. Brock.
[SPEAKER_18]: We put it in a white paper.
[SPEAKER_18]: And and like, honestly, I really like
Jeremy's feedback on that, like what his
[SPEAKER_18]: thoughts are.
[SPEAKER_18]: If we did it, you know, if we did a good
job, what he thinks about that disclosure
[SPEAKER_18]: of information to the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everyone can go look at that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel again, it was pretty misleading.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a regurgitation of all the
information that you've already shared
[SPEAKER_02]: website from all these reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to further separate yourself and
said it's not Dr. Smiley, not a student of
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Smiley, the Dr. Smiley laboratories,
which doesn't make any sense in there for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at least 10, 12 years at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other 40 plus pages is
basically a resume for your by your vice
[SPEAKER_02]: president, Mr. Brock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a separate conversation,
I'd be impressed with his resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that putting information you
already had in what seemingly looks more
[SPEAKER_02]: like a white paper and is not listing his
resume so there's more science words looks
[SPEAKER_02]: to, again, deceive to the average person
that would click on and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: they got proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, there was nothing at all different
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm looking for is any time I
look for a white paper, it is record
[SPEAKER_02]: typically as a real study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that one of the websites where you can
purchase the study or download it if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're a student and it has duplicatable
information and in the bottom,
[SPEAKER_02]: it typically says if there's a conflict of
interest, it'll say competitive interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll state that Dr. Brock, president,
he's on the board, he stands to profit
[SPEAKER_02]: from this information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other reasons why maybe there were
some discrepancies, but it will have
[SPEAKER_02]: duplicatable test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't duplicate any of this stuff from
the results that you shared with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also see you removed the cannabis
tests from the website that were
[SPEAKER_02]: previously there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I gotta say, I just don't think the
white paper is a white paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just a statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, some more spin in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm definitely trying to learn from you,
Jeremy, and make my company better for the
[SPEAKER_18]: industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I'm hearing you say is that you
feel that Dr. Brock, who is a highly
[SPEAKER_18]: accredited professor who's been helping
protect the industry and the environment
[SPEAKER_18]: from chemicals for probably longer than
you and I have both been alive,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's your professional opinion that his
association with those trials is not
[SPEAKER_18]: valid.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's bogus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for the most part, because we were
just looking for a white paper by the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual doctor we mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to see that white paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I know there will be no white
papers, it changes the conversation into
[SPEAKER_02]: where the data may have come from,
whether they're from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: handwritten journals from Dr. Brock
walking around looking at studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: were they from well-documented
side-by-side trials, blessed with the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to properly discern if these
trials were done right or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm thinking is that a million trials
that he made that he did that were real
[SPEAKER_02]: trials and that were really working with
products to look for the better,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's using his gut to determine that these
did work and that even different from
[SPEAKER_02]: that, even if these trials were accurate,
they're not on product or marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, the way microbials work is on a
process called quorum, which I'm not a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist, but if you look up,
they have ways to control how the
[SPEAKER_02]: population interact and which one to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adding new microbes, even one,
let alone dozens, is going to change the
[SPEAKER_02]: results that we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perpetrating these tests as trials done
on the product you're selling to me is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely bogus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would mention that some of them were
done in previous trials, but even using
[SPEAKER_02]: any of that data, I would just say that it
was positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I see that now we're going off
his memory off of his notes saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these ones at different points in
time were really beneficial, like SC27 or
[SPEAKER_02]: soil balance probe, because of that,
to me doesn't translate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows if you change something,
there's a different result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do feel that his motivation has
been tainted because none of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists that have no motivation have
taken the initiative to come out and say
[SPEAKER_02]: why or why not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Nelson has hired, has probably plenty
of time to talk to us, has not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking because he doesn't want
to be in the middle, maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dr. Smiley did take the time to write.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what fact I do have to go on is
that this study did not exist in his name
[SPEAKER_02]: to question everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately for you, a lot of the
mistakes that were made were in your favor
[SPEAKER_02]: and started to add up to look as if it was
manipulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of mistake here, an email from
Mila, like he mentioned, some things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are far fetched, but a number of
mathematical mistakes, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a different picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on this study, all of a sudden
someone coming out that has financial
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in the company without any
further documentation, to me is
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulative.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the average person that is not gonna
ask these hard questions, especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: they already have invested in the product
and they just want any proof so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can not lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of my friends have used this
product and I don't think that they're a
[SPEAKER_02]: worse person for it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an employee that's doing this
side-by-side using your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that the statement doesn't seem
valid to me coming from the part owner.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our company, is extremely, extremely
fortunate to have a pedigree such as Dr.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bruch to support our team and our company.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the studies on our website were
completed independently by Dr. Bruch
[SPEAKER_18]: before his tenure with our corporations.
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense, but there's no data that I
can actually compare that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see those trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not been recorded properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the data is on a different product
than you're currently selling.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well, I appreciate the advice that
you've given us.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there's one thing, Marcus,
that I'd really like to get some clarity
[SPEAKER_18]: on.
[SPEAKER_18]: What I'm gonna do real quick.
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is a question that I have for
Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanna share my screen really,
really quick and show people this.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is... We also look and they quote
Danny Danko to be their senior agronomist,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I don't believe he's an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also look and they quote Danny Danko to
be their senior agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys see this okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: We also look and they quote Danny Danko.
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn the YouTube off there, Peter.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming through pretty loud.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that I have a question
on.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear that okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also look and they quote Danny Danko to be
their senior agronomist.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone's got their YouTube on as well as
the Google chat.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to mute the YouTube so we
don't keep hearing the reverberation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was the Instagram,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it could have been.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what he was trying to point out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that I misleadingly said that it was
their senior agronomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since then I've let go of that
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quoting that he's a senior agronomist
has been more in question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe that's what they're
referencing.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just in the middle of it here with
Bill the Soil and Soil Balance Pro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on real quick, because I don't think
that this got to be thoroughly looked at.
[SPEAKER_18]: So because of the reverberation of the
tag, but essentially this is just how I
[SPEAKER_18]: feel, you know, what he just said
misleading about Dr. Brooke.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the same rhetoric that kind of
defines everything right here.
[SPEAKER_18]: So on Instagram, what ended up happening,
and I can play this.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys can go to his Instagram channel.
[SPEAKER_18]: And essentially what happened was he cut
off the bottom of the actual testimonial
[SPEAKER_18]: that's on our website.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this testimonial has been there for
seven months.
[SPEAKER_18]: And on the bottom it says high times.
[SPEAKER_18]: We never claimed that he was our senior
agronomist.
[SPEAKER_18]: But what Jeremy did was he cut off the
high times.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what I wanted to play for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: I took a shot of the video.
[SPEAKER_18]: He cut off the high times and he just
focused on the top part.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can talk to that if you like.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, he said, we also look here and they
quote, Danny Danko to be their senior
[SPEAKER_18]: agronomist.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now how I know this is true, the bottom of
this video has the little red thing,
[SPEAKER_18]: which means we didn't change it like he's
insinuating us.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this right here, Marcus, it pretty much
lets me know that he's purposefully trying
[SPEAKER_18]: to slander us.
[SPEAKER_18]: This right here is not playing nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not being an adult.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is purposefully doing something that
you guys can all go see what he did and
[SPEAKER_18]: what he said to purposefully slander us.
[SPEAKER_18]: And every single comment other than our
MSDS has been in this fashion.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he admitted it.
[SPEAKER_18]: He got heated.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Danny Danko, this is a silly statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't cut it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram has Square recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cut it off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: No manipulation was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to me, just quoting him as a
senior agronomist to anybody was the funny
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're in our industry,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know who these people are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to let you know, it was
misleading enough that even with the high
[SPEAKER_02]: times listing there, everybody knows he's
with high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were actually attributing
him to be on the board as part of your
[SPEAKER_02]: senior agronomist, as your senior
agronomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because any agronomist, if they work for
high times as not, you can send
[SPEAKER_02]: information out and you can work with that
agronomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whether it was high times or not,
just listed as an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, it was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given you many mistakes and said,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were probably just a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Including that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to break in for one second and
say, listen, really, what you guys need to
[SPEAKER_13]: do is hash this out in private.
[SPEAKER_13]: In public, this is no good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's just tit for tat.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we should have back on the show
is when you two guys have reached a
[SPEAKER_13]: conclusion and you're in agreement.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Sam, there's a friend of mine out there
whose name is Pedro.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that this video answers his
question the other day.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because he literally called me on the show
and he said, hey, man, why did you say
[SPEAKER_18]: that this is your agronomist?
[SPEAKER_18]: Why would you lie like that?
[SPEAKER_18]: And I felt bad because he was given
information by this corporation,
[SPEAKER_18]: Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said right on there that he thought for
your advertising that he was wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does both of you a disservice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does the industry a disservice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, let's find agreement before we...
This is not good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you really think so, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I like the idea of, listen,
what was really not good, Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: What was really not good?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was having no conversation and letting it
grow with social media.
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with you, Marcus, but we're not
coming to a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just airing our dirty laundry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because that was what needs to
happen so that all the things can be out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I give my props up to both of these guys
for putting it out there because here's
[SPEAKER_11]: the thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything has changed with social media.
[SPEAKER_11]: The way we do business, the way we learn,
the way we connect with one another,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's all changing and it's happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: In real time, it's changing like nobody
knows what's happening tomorrow because it
[SPEAKER_11]: changes so fast.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for me, yeah, it's a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear the tip for Tad and that people not
wanting to like kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: like Jeremy has his perspective and so
does Peter.
[SPEAKER_11]: My only hope was really that we could be
able to have a conversation that would
[SPEAKER_11]: move things forward for both companies to
have.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because right now what's happened is what
happens and humans are so limited in the
[SPEAKER_11]: way they react and think in life.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just it creates sides.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, after spending 20 years,
Sam, 20 fucking years on the on the other
[SPEAKER_11]: side of the water hash thing, you know,
having wars and and and and little,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, social poisonings.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes when you can like uncover it
and expose it and open it up and look
[SPEAKER_11]: right into the nastiness, you can clean it
out and you can get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get it working again.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe both of these guys are a huge
benefit to the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: How I know is because in the chat,
there are people defending them to the
[SPEAKER_11]: death.
[SPEAKER_11]: And and that's the part that scares me
when we don't have the conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck, fuck Jeremy from Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck Peter from Soil Balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will go to.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, no, no, that's not what you
need to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: What Jeremy's trying to do is uncover
information.
[SPEAKER_11]: What Peter's trying to do is answer
questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody's trying to trick you or just or or
or take your money.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are both two companies that are
trying to share information in a way that
[SPEAKER_11]: right now they've got a little bump in the
road.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it you got to admit from
Jeremy's perspective, especially I've been
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have absolutely done the Internet
investigation myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's when you get that thread and you
and you pull on it, whether it's a mistake
[SPEAKER_11]: on an MSDS sheet, whether it's an elderly
doctor who can't remember a thing that he
[SPEAKER_11]: did because one of his students did it
under his name, blah, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_11]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_11]: At least we can have a conversation about
it and uncover it and expose it,
[SPEAKER_11]: because right now what you have is half
information.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's being assumed by people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can promise you what is happening is
hurting both of these companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that it would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's hurting both of these
companies, then it's not really that great
[SPEAKER_11]: for, say, the end result of customers
getting products that they are happy to be
[SPEAKER_11]: using.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really what it's supposed to be
all about, that we're happy with the end
[SPEAKER_11]: result of a product that we're using.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's I get where you're coming from,
too, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see here how you would think that
I'm cutting off the high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I it was in the moment I had no no reason
to manipulate that whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could definitely see how from your
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That one's a strong that one's as strong
as the MSDS sheet being wrong and then
[SPEAKER_11]: getting changed and people assuming
they're hiding it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's just as strong as seeing a clip
and that you can see how when we react and
[SPEAKER_11]: these experiences happen that it doesn't
necessarily have to be a sort of evil
[SPEAKER_11]: connotation for things to play out in a
way that people are like, oh, look,
[SPEAKER_11]: look at what happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, look, you see, he's totally full of
shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, well, if you look for the
worst, you'll often find it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's another way of saying it as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'm trying to do today is I'm
trying to pull the best out of build a
[SPEAKER_11]: soil and the best out of soil balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the bottom line from soil balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not yet used the product,
so I don't have a personal opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, some of my friends that grow some
of the best pot that I know of this 30
[SPEAKER_11]: percent yield or 30 percent yield off of
where's my bike.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys have the soil balance going
right now and they're both just they told
[SPEAKER_11]: me the other day, they're like,
dude, I want to buy a couple of kilos of
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unbelievable shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these guys are not the kind of guys to
be tricked, to be manipulated or to have
[SPEAKER_11]: something of that level convinced them
that it's working when it's really not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you that is an impossibility
with these guys here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can I can give props through my
grower friends that I have friends that
[SPEAKER_11]: are using it and are growing with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's it's it's working.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, that's why I wanted to have
the conversation to sort of get all this
[SPEAKER_11]: out in the open.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I totally hear where Sam's coming
from.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just I I I wish we could do this
on so many levels of business.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish we could.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like this to be resolved.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it would be absolutely a good
thing for it to be resolved.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the industry can use products like
these if they're safe and effective,
[SPEAKER_13]: which I believe they probably are.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I mean, I don't think we're
going to really resolve it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they need to resolve it and then
they can come back on the show and
[SPEAKER_13]: announce how they did resolve it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that idea, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, it was just to start a
conversation, get it out in the open,
[SPEAKER_11]: get these guys communicating and get more
exposure to both of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: In their in their journey.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, Hashchurch.
[SPEAKER_11]: I quit Hashchurch fucking three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: I stopped doing this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't put the energy into it anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob Clark came on the show and say
goodbye.
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember vaguely, vaguely remember that it
wasn't that memorable.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say that, oh, you've got to
mute Sam there real quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: So listen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Sam came up to me or no, sorry,
it was Tony three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, oh, we got to do one more
episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, all right, we'll do one more
episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then Sam, then Sam hit me up and said,
hey, come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I come up with a good, good
conversation, a dialogue, like maybe bring
[SPEAKER_11]: a friend in who makes CO2, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, listen, if you want to put some
energy into it, Sam, I will absolutely do
[SPEAKER_11]: another episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the build the soil, soil balance
thing happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought, could we offer this
platform to these two gentlemen to explain
[SPEAKER_11]: their positions and to, you know,
at the same time, to also to give exposure
[SPEAKER_11]: to more people so they can hear more of
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I can tell you right now,
this conversation is just sided and
[SPEAKER_11]: there's people on build the soil side and
there's people on soil balance side.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I was trying to do was just create
more of a people on both sides,
[SPEAKER_11]: get rid of that fence.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's no grass is greener on the
other side.
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's things to be exposed,
they will be exposed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're just trying to open dialogue.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see a point.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're just trying to be a good
mediator.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see a point where there could be
discussion and you're just trying to
[SPEAKER_12]: promote the discussion.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I think that Sam is correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is a little more complicated.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I'm always a fan of not
airing your dirty laundry when if not
[SPEAKER_12]: needed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you both presented your points,
but I think you need to work it behind the
[SPEAKER_12]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, this is just going to be a back
and forth all day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't have all day for this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I respect you both for what you do,
because I know growers who use both your
[SPEAKER_12]: products.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've also heard nothing but,
you know, positive things about both your
[SPEAKER_12]: products.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have to second Sam, you know,
I would take it offline, get your shit
[SPEAKER_12]: together and then come back and tell us
how you've worked it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, as I've seen in chat,
you know, you've definitely have people
[SPEAKER_12]: who are entrenched either way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And both are calling you guys out either
way because of how you presented
[SPEAKER_12]: yourselves, whether you wanted to or not.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just how people are.
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this point, I would, you know,
say, let's wrap this up to a bit,
[SPEAKER_12]: because I see an immediate solution out of
respect to you both, because I respect
[SPEAKER_12]: what you're both trying to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I respect the end products that your
products have produced time and time
[SPEAKER_12]: again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So work it out, figure it out,
you know, shake those trees, make it
[SPEAKER_12]: important.
[SPEAKER_12]: But solve it, you know, quell shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't need this stuff festering the
community because, you know, it's not
[SPEAKER_12]: about jockeying for position, you have
positions and products that are out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if depending on how you respond to
this, you know, could affect how your
[SPEAKER_12]: business goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not from me, I don't buy your products
personally, because I don't grow
[SPEAKER_12]: personally right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, apparently, from looking at and
if you've been watching chat, there's a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of people who do and are so I respect
you both for what you what you have and
[SPEAKER_12]: what you've accomplished.
[SPEAKER_12]: So work it out and then let's take it to
the next step.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would also offer if you know,
I don't know, maybe I'm just being insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you guys do need a moderator in any
way, shape or form, I'm I'm equally on
[SPEAKER_11]: both of your sides.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had Peter on more.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't mean that I'm on Peter's
side more than Jeremy's.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really want to be a neutral sort of
Switzerland for you guys if I can.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's not important, then by all
means, don't don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can I still have lots to do in life.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need we need a big fat cleansing bong
rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't had a bong rip this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Indra.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Forrest.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam's actually in his lab today and he's
going to run us through I think he's going
[SPEAKER_11]: to run us through a BHO run while Indra
tells him everything he's doing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam is as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: He is looking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam is such a fucking awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I told him I said, look, I'm inviting
injury in today and he's going to fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: tell you that you're doing everything
wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what he says to me?
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a fucking guy who wants to learn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who has put his own ego on the side of the
chair.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's just like, great, tell me what
I'm doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's worth a million dollars to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, right off the bat, right off the
bat, I love your buddy's shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: He loves your shirt, Corbin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I was wondering if I could send that
link to Corbin too so he could get on a
[SPEAKER_05]: microphone here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in kind of like a loud area with a
lot of the air.
[SPEAKER_11]: Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could, but we have 10 people in the
chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tight quarters.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll send it to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if somebody drops out,
we'll be able to get in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my boss, Corbin here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Corbin, you want to wave to the camera?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on, Corbin?
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting the dry ice in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get a little closer here.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first things we're doing to get
started with our run is using a condensing
[SPEAKER_05]: coil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flip this around so you can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a pump that we use to recover
the butane out of our collection pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a coil here that's immersed in dry
ice and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've just loaded some ice in there,
and then it will, it exits at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one big improvement we made is
that it will drain via gravity into our
[SPEAKER_05]: solvent tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a closed-loop solvent extractor
we're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Precision PX1.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've made a few modifications to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the most part, Precision's got a
pretty decent setup for an easy,
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient workflow here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got a dewaxing column.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it's pretty cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some chillers in the next room.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the modifications we've
made recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually eliminated the material column
from this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I take it that pan is there just to catch
the condensation from the ice?
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the cold columns here drip a
little bit, and it just collects water
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of making a mess on our floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we're running.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's check our solvent tank here before
we get going too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll kick on the vacuum pump so we can
pull the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_12]: You may want to speak into your mic a
little more, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a little distant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the heads up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that any better?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our solvent chiller.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can see here our solvent temperature
in that tank is about negative 24 degrees
[SPEAKER_05]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've also got the heater here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this keeps warm water in the jacket of
the collection pot, which is how we boil
[SPEAKER_05]: off the gas to recover it and get it ready
to pour out in the machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this here is the rest of our
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Corbin, do you want to actually just
throw this headset on and tell them a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit about what we're going to be
doing before him?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be your cameraman.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks like some sauces.
[SPEAKER_12]: We seem to have lost your audio,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he wasn't talking yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're live, so you need to keep the
conversation rolling.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to let you guys check out
some of our finished product that we got
[SPEAKER_04]: here, stuff that's out for laboratory
testing, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One strain we've done a lot with lately,
super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all from fresh resin material.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is all BHO extractions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all hydrocarbon extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a butane, propane blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you know, something like this,
you know, we're still waiting on the
[SPEAKER_04]: residual solvents and terpene tests and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in our previous batches of this
strain, you know, we've been hitting in
[SPEAKER_04]: the high teams.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last one was, you know, 18 percent
terpenes for a homogenized mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the packagers grab this up,
stir it up and get all the terpenes kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of spread back throughout it.
[SPEAKER_12]: People were asking why was it so watery?
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's the terpenes that are suspended on
the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, the terpenes will naturally
separate, kind of rise to the top,
[SPEAKER_04]: lighter compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's said when the packagers
are getting into it, we have them kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: emulsify that stuff so that, you know,
every gram gets a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene layer in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: What percentage of the terpenes do you
think you're actually capturing and what
[SPEAKER_13]: percentage are being lost to the process?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done any, you know,
terpene testing prior to any of our
[SPEAKER_04]: purging processes or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would definitely be an
interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you say French frozen, does that mean
the material is actually like a fresh
[SPEAKER_13]: plant that's been frozen and it still has
water frozen in with it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, correct.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can BHO it with water trapped in
it like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as long as the temperatures remain
cold and all that water freezes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've never once finished a run and
looked in the collection pot to see any
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture or water or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know nothing about BHO, so I was just
asking a question that's a pretty ignorant
[SPEAKER_13]: guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam is so ignorant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So over here, we've got kind of a higher
cannabinoid portion of a run.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are actually from the same exact
extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one has been separated.
[SPEAKER_04]: One has had all the native terpenes left
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a much higher testing
in THCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be your potent
knockout kind of dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be for those consumers
that just want flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: In here, we've got some stuff that was ran
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of earlier in the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure it's really picking up on the
camera, but it's just starting to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks purple.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, time for a bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you're going to purge that now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just starting the purging
stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's real early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except this is just extracted yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of prior to any
crystallization or separating.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the jars, you said that they were 18%
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what percent THC or THCA?
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, for our higher terpene testing
stuff, we're seeing in the high 50% to mid
[SPEAKER_04]: 70% range.
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason I asked it was because if your
cannabis is, say, 20% THC, and your
[SPEAKER_13]: product there is 70%, it's three and a
half times stronger.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the terpenes, it doesn't seem like you
lost very many, is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I truly believe we're
capturing everything that we can without
[SPEAKER_04]: sacrificing quality and picking up things
that we don't want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those are pretty high numbers,
18%.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's your parts per million residuals on
your test?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so most of them, let's see if I can
find the tester.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, we're under 100 PPMs a lot of
times, none detected.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a test result for our Dutch
Treat live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one was 17%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpenes, 59% THC total.
[SPEAKER_04]: This laboratory only tests down to 25 PPMs
if there was none detected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Microtoxins ratings all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of our more recent ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our highest testing terpene total
so far at 21.49.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, no detected solids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So typically, the higher terpene extracts,
because that terpene portion of it is so
[SPEAKER_04]: water-like, it's actually very easy to
remove all those residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of misconceptions about
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you producing this material yourselves
or are you purchasing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, say that again.
[SPEAKER_12]: This material that you're running,
is this stuff that you have grown from the
[SPEAKER_12]: beginning or is this stuff that you
purchase?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a pretty small grow here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the demand of our concentrates,
we do purchase a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we buy a lot of stuff from large
greenhouse grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys, how is the pesticides,
Michael butanol systemic sort of pesticide
[SPEAKER_07]: issues other people are having?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys running into that at all,
post?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, we're pretty careful with the
farmers that we work with and have got
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a bit of trust in the sold them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done random pesticide tests on
starting material, things like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: just to check.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also, the farm that we work with
primarily, we've encouraged that they have
[SPEAKER_04]: actually the Liquor Control Board and the
Department of Agriculture come out and be
[SPEAKER_04]: voluntary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pesticide testing, in our minds the fact
that they're willing to do that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put a lot of trust in them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you testing the final product though,
as far as post concentration?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not typically now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every once in a while we'll do a random
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would definitely recommend it for
certain farms just as you check them
[SPEAKER_07]: because we've seen a problem where a lot
of flowers test clean until we concentrate
[SPEAKER_07]: it and all the sudden things start popping
up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially if the farm is getting their
clones from other sources that they think
[SPEAKER_13]: are clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a big concern.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when your product is finished like
that and it's 18 or 21 percent terpenes,
[SPEAKER_13]: are most of the mono terpenes still
intact?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it close to the original profile?
[SPEAKER_13]: Of the plant?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, now I hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you see that recently published
article about CO2 extractions and how they
[SPEAKER_13]: have a tendency to lose all the monos?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I haven't had a chance to look
through it, but Sam just sent it to me
[SPEAKER_04]: yesterday, so that's on my list of things
to kind of read.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely always had a feeling that
there was something about CO2 extraction,
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor and terpene wise that was going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't saying that you lose all the
monos.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was saying that there was chemistry
going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some were changing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, a combination of loss and change,
you're correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's about all I got to show you
here as far as finished product and things
[SPEAKER_04]: of that nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably jump into the other room and
switch the mic over.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think there's a limit to the size
of beakers that you can create these
[SPEAKER_13]: crystals of?
[SPEAKER_13]: In other words, if you had a 10,000 liter
beaker, would it still work?
[SPEAKER_05]: We certainly don't have the oven space to
try anything that large, but from
[SPEAKER_05]: everything we've tried, the smaller
surface area does seem to help.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we're doing these really large
runs, it just becomes many, many jars that
[SPEAKER_05]: would have to get filled up.
[SPEAKER_11]: John, John, they're using ovens,
John.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what Indra has to say about using
vac ovens.
[SPEAKER_12]: We lost you again.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't hear you, Indra.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your microphone now is the opposite of
what it was last week and we can barely
[SPEAKER_12]: hear you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it sounds like it's in your ass
instead of your mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I just had to make everyone laugh.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad you're sticking around too,
Jeremy, because I want us to talk a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bit more just about your company and about
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Same with you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can still have conversations without
getting into the actual back and forth
[SPEAKER_11]: that Sam and Etienne have no time for.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have time for the resolution when it
will be announced.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the resolution will be announced.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, shout out to Pharmacy for the nice
hat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Today is day one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think the take home message from
today, take home message from today is
[SPEAKER_15]: that growing organically is a dirty,
dirty, dirty process and everybody should
[SPEAKER_15]: be growing hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's basically... You're starting
to take on Sam's humor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like dirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not if you want terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: True story.
[SPEAKER_11]: True story.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try to deny that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're going to see some signs to
back that up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know that Tony, who is doing a lot
of terpene extraction, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: not many people are actually extracting
terpenes the way Tony is.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he has a very unique perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish he was here today because he
definitely sees a very high percentage
[SPEAKER_11]: coming out of like greenhouse,
but terpenes higher, much higher than
[SPEAKER_11]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working now.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were pretty much the first to be doing
a quantified terpene method.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I know a little bit about terps.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying Tony processes like
hundreds, thousands of pounds of cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: to produce terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's produced more terpenes than most
people will ever see in their life.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: In other words, he knows what produces and
what don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's exactly all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not like Mr. Terpene science guy,
but he's definitely like out of all the
[SPEAKER_11]: people I talk to, because I'll often be
like, Oh, how many thousands of pounds
[SPEAKER_11]: have you run for terpenes?
[SPEAKER_11]: And they'll be like, what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be like, I thought so.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: My two cents about your crystal phenomenon
or your THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a phenomenon to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are leaving a certain amount of
gas in your extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the gas is doing as the gas
matriculate as the gas matriculates out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're letting it fit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighter stuff goes to the top and the
heavier stuff falls to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking for agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm explaining something to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heavier stuff is the THCA crystals
falling out on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lighter stuff is the higher
fractions in the terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going out near the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a phenomenon because we've
got a 120 pound chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extract 25 kilos at a whack and we see
it happen in the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's because our system doesn't work
like yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We freeze the top chamber as we're putting
it in by the way we put the gas in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it through special kind of nozzle
that freezes everything that freezes all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant lipids and wax right in the top
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just shower down the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bottom we have very pure
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of pictures on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what the material comes out
the way we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have these extra columns and
stuff because we don't need them because
[SPEAKER_00]: our system thermodynamically balanced and
it's thermodynamically levered from one
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the extraction to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at the bottom of ours we have zero
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do pour outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't advocate pour outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think it's a safe process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our system recovers all of the gas and
puts all of the gas back in the storage
[SPEAKER_00]: tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't use vacuum ovens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a vacuum oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bottom chamber is using the heat from
the compressed gas and the jacket around
[SPEAKER_00]: it to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it purges right in the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these other things that you guys
have got going there, the vacuum oven and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff, those are all things that
were done like a doctor sometimes treats
[SPEAKER_00]: things from the symptoms rather than
what's really wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how those systems came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That system that you're running there came
about that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our system is just received the state of
California zone two certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not a class one zone one system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're class one zone two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't need a bomb proof room to run ours
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that says a lot for the safety of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because of the way we look at
it and how we handle everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gas comes in the room, goes into the
chamber, goes into the bottom chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: is recovered back out and very quickly
sent right back to a filter system to the
[SPEAKER_00]: storage tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the California fire department
liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well that they gave us class two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like a fantastic system,
Andrew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been following you closely since
your first appearance on House Church back
[SPEAKER_05]: on episode 96 and 98.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if you recall,
but I actually wrote you inquiring about
[SPEAKER_05]: your system to see if I could purchase one
for a previous company I was working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where'd you write to?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a big fan of John.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was John Davis at Yahoo.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you missed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a brief dialogue back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you didn't have any systems that were
ready for I-502 compliance in Washington
[SPEAKER_05]: State.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're running with what the law permits
us to run with, the system that works well
[SPEAKER_05]: for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to see your system up and
running and to see how it works and what
[SPEAKER_05]: it puts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our system sits on a sled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got everything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a recovery system that we
imported from Germany that under ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions can recover 25 gallons a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the heat from this compression
to help purge the gas back out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we do 120 pound loads every
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you put the 120 pounds in an hour
later, you got the 15 or 20 kilos of oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom chamber, the catch chamber
is an 85 gallon chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually dump another load in
the top and extract a second and a third
[SPEAKER_00]: and a fourth one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can carry on all day long in an eight
hour shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy can extract a thousand pounds
without very much difficulty at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he's got two or three guys,
one guy preparing it by cryo grinding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can bump that up to nearly double.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system is a real beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits on a sled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It weighs 2000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top chamber is a 30 inch man way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom door is a 24 inch man way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually crawl in to these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made at Holloway Steel,
which is one of the finest stainless steel
[SPEAKER_00]: foundries in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from Holloway, they get shipped
directly to Universal Air Gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: who mounts the German recovery pump system
and the vacuum system and the control
[SPEAKER_00]: system and the computer all together on
it, test it, gases it up, bubble wraps it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then ships it to you ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really solid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air gas wouldn't be involved if it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are, they're on oil platforms
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They designed our recovery system for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it's the hottest thing since
sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not arrogant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about the truth,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people out there who think I'm
arrogant when I say these things are the
[SPEAKER_00]: same people that think open blasting is
good or Elvis is still alive or Obama was
[SPEAKER_00]: born in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the people are just sick and tired
of like waiting for the units and nobody's
[SPEAKER_15]: seen the results in the lab results or
anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, if you can't, who's nobody,
who's nobody.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll say me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting tired of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause it's like, I've been waiting for a
long time to hear all these, to see all
[SPEAKER_15]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's been talk, talk, talk.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, when, when are the systems
coming out?
[SPEAKER_00]: When here's the deal drug guy,
go on the site, make an order,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a deposit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, I know people,
I know people in the industry that have
[SPEAKER_14]: done that and they're still waiting for
their machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to like the deal was on
how long the wait was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all completely above board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going along swimmingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Halloway's got the stuff nearly done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go to air gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what part of it will you shut your
mouth off about them?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I want to see a unit working in
honesty, the lab results before I put any
[SPEAKER_14]: money at money down, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not too much to ask.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell you one dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: I, uh, I appreciate your candor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Mara.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate your is a special fight
church.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's no, this is court church.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone was calling it court hash court.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, well, let's just call it integrity
church.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, shit, when, you know, it's like,
what is this an ad, like everybody getting
[SPEAKER_14]: up here and just pumping their stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we going to have some results?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I will say this, like I've said it
before.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I asked Indra to see results,
I said, I pulled a, you, I was kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: like the doubting Thomas who wanted to
touch the incorporeal body of Christ.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what I did was I sent him material
and I said, if you can just make the best
[SPEAKER_11]: resin, then you should have no fucking
problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was aggressive about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: De-fatting this hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, dude, listen, it's maybe a story,
but I'm telling you, you know how involved
[SPEAKER_11]: I am in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but dude, I mean, I've heard it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been there, seen that and we're past
that stage now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like, if, if these magical units
exist, then why can't I see one?
[SPEAKER_15]: Why can't I go like, you know,
run some material through it and get a lab
[SPEAKER_15]: result?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm saying that's not, that's not too much
to ask.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do a live work session.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were tested in the flavor and fragrance
industry for 14 years by all the real
[SPEAKER_00]: labs, not marijuana labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were tested because we made stuff for
the first day for termination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extracted flavors and fragrances for 14
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fact that we're just slipping
over into the cannabis industry could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: heads up and everybody thinking,
wow, here comes expertise from around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world from someone that's been extracting
everything, not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the problem is, man, is that when you
get up and you start telling when it's the
[SPEAKER_15]: guy that's selling the machine,
that's telling everybody that they're the
[SPEAKER_15]: world expert with no data to back it up,
then that's a real problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and, and there's nothing that you can
do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can say that's going to change my mind
on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if you're selling bacteria or
you're selling machines.
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought Mark bought one of the machines
and is using it in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, is he, is it delivered yet?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, can I go down and see it run and
get a lab result and send it to the lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely, you definitely cannot go
down and see it run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I ain't putting any money down.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's as easy as that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, obviously when people buy these
machines, though, they have to see them
[SPEAKER_11]: tested.
[SPEAKER_11]: No one's buying this site unseen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they, Indra?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we make a test run for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody approves the test run loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So who, who is, who, who do we know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do we know in our community?
[SPEAKER_11]: That has had a test run and seen this
done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, Mark Scaldone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were joking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were saying me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just find it funny that there's always
a, you know, Todd was in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the doubting Thomas.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, well then get him to go see him.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go fucking see him and get, get,
get an extract done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I sent him material when he lived in
Kansas and it was like less than a week
[SPEAKER_11]: later, I got the shit back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had it tested in multiple labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I had it done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you contacted him at all Chimera in
regards to this, or did you just talk to
[SPEAKER_14]: him with the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm being just honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I'm sure like now you've offended
him.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's going to be like, you can't come
here, but I'm sure it would be as simple
[SPEAKER_14]: as, I mean, if I'm offending someone,
by asking questions about their product
[SPEAKER_15]: and their process, then that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like you can go into ridiculous is your
attitude, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the vibes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the question at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also don't have a horse in this race.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just once again, trying to be
Switzerland, trying to be the moderator,
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to keep everyone happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I like you both.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan, you need to have really good vibes
like me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you don't have to have any vibes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying it wasn't asked.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm asking the question.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was this.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, he was like the automatic
human response to that vibe, Indra or not,
[SPEAKER_11]: is and back and forth it goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I thought that soil balance and build
a soil was doing much better in their
[SPEAKER_11]: disagreements, but hey, I'm not here to
judge.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you said it, I laughed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when Indra said what he said,
I laughed then too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once again, I see all the sheep
in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Picking sides right away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Indra's fake.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Chimera doesn't know what he's
talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I just think it's all hilarious.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like a human experiment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Please continue to all do what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And nobody's doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody's doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: In between the third week of January and
the second week of February, five will be
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those five, all those people,
took samples, looked into it, even had
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers, did due diligence, looked at the
patent and they bought into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm getting ready to start on
manufacturing cycle number two,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to make pen in a second
manufacturing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus we now have a build budget sheet
coming for the five liter model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is five gallons up and 10 gallons
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's going to be affordable and
it's going to be the people's extractor
[SPEAKER_00]: for people who want a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can extract.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what we'll do?
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll put it on the bin like we did with
build a soil and soil balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what you can do is just come back with
the solution.
[SPEAKER_11]: When it's the unit and it's available and
you're sitting there and you've invited
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam over and you guys are going to do a
batch, then that's the solution.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's, you know, in Chimera's
defense, it's a lot of, it's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about the unit, some photos of it,
but not even like a video or something
[SPEAKER_11]: that people definitely are way past due in
seeing this process work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wouldn't you love to... It doesn't
make a sound, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits there absolutely quiet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the process, filling it, emptying it,
opening the door, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: all those little things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I mean, it's definitely a big part
of marketing a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as soon as they're finished at the
install site where we're putting the one
[SPEAKER_00]: in with the ventilation, which they're not
done with yet, we will do the first run
[SPEAKER_00]: and Johnny will take a video of that while
it's happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, forget Johnny.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should invite like vice or something,
bro, to come down there with reds and
[SPEAKER_11]: actually fucking create a production for
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, look, even, even Sam's here
showing the process.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it might not be the one you agree
with, but there he is showing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There they are doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, welcome dragonfly medicine,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having us this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're super honored.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally spaced on you guys last week and
I remember being like, damn, like I forgot
[SPEAKER_11]: to invite though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm the worst.
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I don't have a list.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although that's not really true.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not really true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause just yesterday I found this,
which was, I think this was like the hash
[SPEAKER_11]: church, like the big, big, big episode,
the three year episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, every, every day morning Sunday
when I do it, it's just kind of by my
[SPEAKER_11]: memory.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I go through Facebook's the hardest
cause sometimes I'll forget Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes I'll forget skunk man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you guys are of the unique group
along with Wade and Alec from SC labs,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, and sub cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a few others that are via email.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to do two separate invitations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So much going on right now here at the
farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just felt like, oh, it's, it's great to
be able to take a break with you guys for
[SPEAKER_09]: a few hours this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we love you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Busy season.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure for you guys right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as the rains came, it's when
things need to start kicking up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're running around the clock right
now with a small crew and feeling very
[SPEAKER_09]: blessed.
[SPEAKER_09]: What amazing summer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right till the end of October.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we have flavor still in the greenhouse
right now with like snow right on the top
[SPEAKER_16]: of the mountains right there.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw some frozen things down at Benson
Elvis's place in Washington and some other
[SPEAKER_11]: places that just like fields just frozen
on the stock.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, even Southern Oregon and
Northern California got some pretty good
[SPEAKER_16]: frosts on there.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: It brings the frost.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm glad to have you guys here
sharing the good vibes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've, we've had, we've had an interesting
hashtag.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a really, that's a really loud
sound, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you got to keep that mic muted unless
you want to say something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he kept it muted.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been like, sometimes I get into these
funny little like mute wars.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to jump in, but there's a lot
of discussion happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just wanted to get things going here.
[SPEAKER_11]: How much does that chamber fit?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the solvent tank here can hold about 20
pounds of solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: The material column, as you saw,
we had these socks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a good analogy here is kind of like
when you're making bubble hash using the
[SPEAKER_05]: work bag, using these column stocks so
that we can put our material inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for fresh frozen, which is what we're
doing today, you can fold it in half.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can fit about five to six pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now most of that weight is water,
you know, which is frozen ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then during the extraction process,
we do our best to keep everything as cold
[SPEAKER_05]: as possible so that it never warms up and
we can maintain the quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis is so incredible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm just like a kind of like sift
guy, water hash guy, but it's quite
[SPEAKER_11]: something that you can have these insane
machines built and, and be using CO2 and
[SPEAKER_11]: all different hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_11]: And can't forget Horatio's old method of
using the actual terpene delimiters.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just unbelievable that it produces
its own hydrocarbons to do its own
[SPEAKER_11]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like how kind of insane is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like inception.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's something I definitely wanted
to bring up is Indra was telling me that
[SPEAKER_05]: we were leaving a large amount of solvent
behind because we found that the terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannabis are more effective solvent to
promote crystallization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really recover all the solvent we
can out of the run and just let the
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes do their work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's more about the extraction process
and the gases that are used to get a
[SPEAKER_05]: thorough extraction of those terpenes that
allow us to create the sauces.
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chemistry of the plant does a lot for
us as long as we let it do its work.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't think I'll be picking up
the, the, the method tomorrow by any
[SPEAKER_11]: means.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just such a fan of like the quick and
easy, just like, you know, produce that
[SPEAKER_11]: nice little oil right at home with just a
press.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm most certainly also a fan of level
hash and dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And holy shit, that dry sift that you had
sifted there that you gave me a dab of was
[SPEAKER_05]: a pretty pale punch.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a different kind of a
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another option out there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I sure wouldn't fight against
any particular.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, let me mute your mic again,
because it's really bad sound going inside
[SPEAKER_11]: the column there as they fill it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, I'm not really one to
fight against any one.
[SPEAKER_11]: As I get older, I realize, you know,
promote the one you love or the ones you
[SPEAKER_11]: love over fighting against the ones that
you maybe don't think people should be
[SPEAKER_11]: doing or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares about your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like let people do what they want to do,
take it to the highest level.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for me, I've just been, you know,
more promotion promoting like the methods
[SPEAKER_11]: that I prefer, which are solventless
methods.
[SPEAKER_11]: I say solventless, which is kind of
impossible because the terpenes are some
[SPEAKER_11]: of them are solventless.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess in that sense, you can't
really ever have a solventless product if
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a cannabis extract unless you're
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: People have told us that water is solvent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, water is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's it's kind of a funny one.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of just like the most like
ironic term for salt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I guess what I tell people when they
say I say maybe if you want to promote the
[SPEAKER_11]: fact that it's like non petrochemical
solvents to make this extract.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could kind of get a little more
specific about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, butane is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, how you apply the butane to
the product makes a huge, huge difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in the outcome of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the fact that they are flooding
the chamber is makes them have to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the step number two of having a column
that's very cold to remove the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: they got from flooding the chamber rather
than freezing the chamber itself and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting the essential oil washed
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that column is frozen,
sargenically frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a chiller that maintains the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm saying the reason you need that
column is because your extraction chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't up to snuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't designed right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you need that column in order because
you flood your chamber and then you drain
[SPEAKER_00]: the flood off which contains the lipids
and the waxes and the oil and we don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: about it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, enough said about my way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using the very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a bunch of them around and
people will be if you're interested,
[SPEAKER_00]: get in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'll reach out again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no past.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always happy to have better equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want the best weed to run and we want
the best equipment to extract.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a big fan of oil but Sam brought,
he had a tiny little piece of this sugar
[SPEAKER_11]: wax or whatever it was and it smelled
beautiful, looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost wanted to photograph it with my
macro lens because it was just like little
[SPEAKER_11]: diamonds shining.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he seems to be a conscious guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He taught us about vape pens and the
insides of the vape pens and what was
[SPEAKER_11]: going on inside those pens before really
any of us were thinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, another guy kind of like Jeremy
asking the hard questions like,
[SPEAKER_11]: hey, what's your vape pen made out of?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your element made out of?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any things that the oil can come
in?
[SPEAKER_11]: What are all the things made out of that
the oil comes in contact?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the space between the element and
where the air comes in to vaporize the
[SPEAKER_11]: oil?
[SPEAKER_11]: He was asking like questions that like let
me tell you 99.8% of vape cart companies
[SPEAKER_11]: absolutely did not want to answer the
answer to Sam's questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a good appreciation for his
persistence in knowledge and learning and
[SPEAKER_11]: his ability to execute.
[SPEAKER_11]: So give thanks for coming out today,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for having me,
Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot that I've learned and I'm
happy to be here able to just show
[SPEAKER_05]: something and hopefully some people
watching can learn something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's all I'm trying to bring
to Bubble Man's world today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got solvent coming back in to our
solvent tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is passively recovering right now
because we've got a pretty large
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature differential.
[SPEAKER_05]: The solvent tank here is in a 25 PSI and
we're still at about 45 PSI here in the
[SPEAKER_05]: recovery pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a minute we're going to kick on
this pump and I'll try to mute my mic
[SPEAKER_05]: again because then it'll get really loud
in here and we'll transfer into the other
[SPEAKER_05]: room to keep chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool EO.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on in the world of forest?
[SPEAKER_11]: How's Silas doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for asking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are, I think with the exception of the
morning we were evacuated for the fires.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were 38 days seizure free at that point
and that chaos kind of threw us through a
[SPEAKER_07]: loop.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had some seizures that night,
but it hasn't had any major ones since
[SPEAKER_07]: then.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're somewhere around 50, 50 days in
one seizure, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So for a kid who had about 20 to 60 a day
before this journey, that's pretty damn
[SPEAKER_07]: successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just creates creates a landscape for
healing, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a hundred percent
pharmaceutical free, which is also
[SPEAKER_07]: important to be healthy because you know,
I'm not all anti-pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the reality of some of these drugs is
when you're tinkering with
[SPEAKER_07]: neurotransmitter regulation, it can do as
much harm as it can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, he's, he's doing great and take
that method.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we're working to get things out to
all the other kids that we're helping.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, trying to catch up from the
fires, but pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a rosin press.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got our first rosin press for the
network.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone's talking about machines.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at adding some other
machines within the year and really
[SPEAKER_07]: stepping up what we're able to offer these
families.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I just had two more of me to,
to work for free full time, I'd be a happy
[SPEAKER_07]: guy, but you'd be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, we're good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Found out I'm probably going to be
speaking at the Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, very nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd be good to see everybody down
there, but it'd also be good to get up on
[SPEAKER_07]: some of these panels and really start to
add to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to be fun.
Dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: How, how awesome was that?
[SPEAKER_11]: That you said Emerald Cup and Alec was
like, pop.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Did someone say the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just were like talking with Forrest
literally just mentioned the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_11]: and in you popped.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Were you guys talking about discussion
panels?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Forrest is going to be speaking at the
Emerald Cup.
Epic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm excited to see you guys down there
and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited to see everybody who's
watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited to be down there, but I was
down there last year, but it was like for
[SPEAKER_07]: this top secret sort of MacGyver mission
where we were picking up a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: clones and moms for the network that
someone had smuggled in there for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't get a chance to really hang.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, this year I'm really excited to
be able to participate and see everybody
[SPEAKER_07]: and spend some time there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Looking forward to hugging you Forrest.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you come down, check out the teepee
and come see us or we'll find you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: The teepee.
[SPEAKER_11]: How sweet is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: How sweet is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Come find us in the teepee.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're right next to forever flowering
too.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we kind of have this like sweet lounge
set up on both sides.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just a really good Oasis from the
Creos that's out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just go and get $5 couches all over
Santa Rosa and line the whole teepee with
[SPEAKER_09]: it and have a hangout.
[SPEAKER_16]: Although this year we may not be able to
find so many $5 couches.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we might just use wood and stumps.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll tell you why it's crazy down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to everyone who's suffered from
those fires.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a, what a, what a, I mean,
I've seen a bunch of different media on it
[SPEAKER_11]: is definitely some of the craziest photos
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I didn't know like houses and
neighborhoods could burn down without the
[SPEAKER_11]: trees burning down or even looking
damaged.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like that looks like some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I don't want to open up the
conspiracy channel, but does that not look
[SPEAKER_11]: like seriously strange or is that just
something that happened?
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that crazy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you take it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say it depends.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the trees are hard to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the trees look like they're alive,
but they're in pretty poor shape.
[SPEAKER_11]: But some are like green leaves and like
fully alive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just like, wow, like that's the
first time I've ever seen a forest fire
[SPEAKER_11]: where the forest didn't burn.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like trees were standing for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just survived the heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, definitely more prepared for fires
than homes are.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, lots, lots of these pine trees and
coniferous trees actually need fire to be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to breed and be able to seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes they'll go 15, 20 years
without actually being able to have seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: that are, you know, viable.
[SPEAKER_09]: So having a fire come through there and it
has to take that really super hot
[SPEAKER_09]: temperature to be able to melt that pit.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be able to create a seed.
[SPEAKER_16]: So another thing is the firemen were
talking about how there's wildfires and
[SPEAKER_16]: tree forest fires, and then there's urban
fires and there's usually a way that they
[SPEAKER_16]: can stop the fire from going into the
urban areas.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when it goes into the urban areas,
the fire changes, the energy of it changes
[SPEAKER_16]: and fires really are energy.
[SPEAKER_16]: They start just gobbling up houses.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just like, whoa, this is fuel.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's like propane and paint and gas.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's shit everywhere and it's just
gobbling up homes and it just,
[SPEAKER_16]: it really turns into like an animal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Different energy.
[SPEAKER_16]: And like what Sub was saying with the 70
mile an hour winds, it just took it from
[SPEAKER_16]: crazy to something more than crazy.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also of note to say that in British
Columbia was one of the worst fires in
[SPEAKER_16]: history on British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_16]: It didn't take out in towns in the same
way that it did in California.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not to take away from that,
but three, million acres burned in British
[SPEAKER_16]: Columbia this year, three million and
Oregon, all of the gorge, some of them
[SPEAKER_16]: view most beautiful hikes outside of
Portland and the gorge going down the
[SPEAKER_16]: Columbia river all got burnt.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a crazy year.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really big.
[SPEAKER_16]: We even put them a lot of help out and
support to those people.
[SPEAKER_16]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: They set up huge relief funds for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's crazy is they just indicted
a kid for throwing firecrackers that
[SPEAKER_12]: started that fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: 15 years old fireworks.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were shooting fireworks off and they
were so proud of themselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they got, they got in a little
chase trying to get away.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they got caught.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty sickening like to think
about, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't like they shot off one bottle
rocket and went off.
[SPEAKER_16]: They shot up multiple and people ran into
town to get cops.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how long they were on the trail
for.
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway, that's, you know, whatever
it's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Humans were responsible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shocker.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I got on my soap box last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not doing much social media,
but this, um, Oh, what's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's loud and obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they canceled the CGA in
Hezekiah Allen's group.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of our Nevada County cannabis
Alliance folks were putting together
[SPEAKER_07]: fundraisers for the families and had
raised quite a bit of money for these
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just last night, I believe,
or it might've been the night before,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the SACB picked up that refunded
everyone's donations because, because they
[SPEAKER_07]: were had to do with cannabis and they
wouldn't allow them to use their fund
[SPEAKER_07]: raising platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I got my donation back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what the hell's going on with this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I saw the SACB picked it up and
it just, it's absolutely infuriating to
[SPEAKER_07]: me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't hear a lot of people really.
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I heard, it was the processor.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't the site that was doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So any of the money processors,
once they start processing money and they
[SPEAKER_12]: started to hear it's cannabis,
it was pulled from the processor.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's where it stops.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, it's still the money.
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem we still have where we can't
have hangs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been kicked out of 36 of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, the fortunate reality.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard, I heard they can't insure
themselves properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't participate in the community
and prepare like any other responsible
[SPEAKER_07]: business could.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when they lose everything,
including the cash they had on site,
[SPEAKER_07]: their crops, their homes with their
children, then the community is not
[SPEAKER_07]: allowed to come together and then support
them carrots.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why we supported soil King because
he's just an individual who lives on earth
[SPEAKER_16]: in the area.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's no one that can stop him from
taking money and giving it out to someone.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's exactly why I told people to go
direct.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I was telling people on my chat,
look, I'm not sure about any of these go
[SPEAKER_11]: funds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I, I'll let me find out where the
best place to go to is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'll direct you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it was soil King that I also told
people to go to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same, same here.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, kind of in line with that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's a slight, slight,
straight, but I was talking to Tim Blake
[SPEAKER_17]: just the other day and, and Eventbrite
just kind of pulled some bullshit on them
[SPEAKER_17]: where, I mean, I guess visa just,
you know, international kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess, pretty crack down really hard on
Eventbrite and just are doing a big crack
[SPEAKER_17]: down on anything cannabis related right
now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so from that Eventbrite basically
canceled the Emerald cups ability to,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, basically hold, you know,
or to, to sell tickets.
[SPEAKER_17]: Through Eventbrite or to kind of do,
you know, the competition type stuff of
[SPEAKER_17]: it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, Tim and the Emerald cup
team, you know, this, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: this year are kind of, kind of,
you know, working together with the red
[SPEAKER_17]: light management who kind of, you know,
does hundreds of kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: major events and festivals across the
United States.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so they were able to kind of reach out
and basically try to chat Eventbrite.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so Eventbrite, they still kind of
disallowed them from being able to,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, run the contest aspect through
Eventbrite because it was directly
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_17]: But they were able to manage to,
you know, salvage, you know, still being
[SPEAKER_17]: able to get tickets for the Emerald cup
through it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it just, it just mind blowing how kind
of, yeah, just, you know, these,
[SPEAKER_17]: these fucking merchant processors,
you know, with their whimsical decisions
[SPEAKER_17]: to kind of just, you know, be these self
appointed guardians of the status quo and
[SPEAKER_17]: how much effect they can have across the
entire industry from banking to,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, just, you know, when one fails
to loop, just chapping a whole event or
[SPEAKER_17]: let alone more devastating kind of a whole
community people that, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to come around a cause like helping
to fight, you know, raise money for fire
[SPEAKER_17]: relief and then just kind of chopping
people off at the knees from even being
[SPEAKER_17]: able to, as a community gather to,
you know, make any type of difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really interesting because we've,
we've done a lot of disaster relief and
[SPEAKER_09]: gone into international areas and it's big
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just lay it down like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really big business.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's big business for the red cross to
come in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're making a crap ton of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're creating.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Red cross is actually even going into
areas that have maybe a small shelter set
[SPEAKER_09]: up there or a church that decided that
they wanted to take in people and they're
[SPEAKER_09]: sending out there, whatever people to say,
Hey, we're going to shut this down because
[SPEAKER_09]: this is not a proper shelter.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's really big business out
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: The world health organization,
um, red cross, you know, I work with all
[SPEAKER_09]: of those people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, money and business and
corporation comes first before helping the
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why community efforts and
energy.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you got to find people on the
ground that you love and support.
[SPEAKER_16]: And even the house that we went,
we went to rent a house in Emerald cup and
[SPEAKER_16]: it burnt.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the people's house, it was their
rental house.
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, both their houses burnt.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, should we just rent an RV or should
we just pitch a tent?
[SPEAKER_16]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_16]: So we kept looking and we found this house
in the middle of the nuns fire and the guy
[SPEAKER_16]: just said, you know what, we're going to
give it to you at our cost, which is like
[SPEAKER_16]: one 10th of what it would have cost the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And just give, he was a fireman.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's like, just give the rest to the fire
agency down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to give them twice the
amount of what the rental cost and really
[SPEAKER_09]: try to fund rate.
[SPEAKER_16]: We know how to give it direct and anyone
who's coming to stay at our house,
[SPEAKER_16]: they'll give some too.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I have a fit.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to be staying in a house in
the middle of the fire.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think now is the time for
Californians in that area to really look
[SPEAKER_16]: at land use and how they're going to deal
with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: How they're going to deal with the runoff
when the rains come with the ash.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think now using all that burnt wood and
all the wood that's around to lay out
[SPEAKER_16]: laterally on the hillsides, to stop water
from flowing downhill is going to be
[SPEAKER_16]: cruel.
[SPEAKER_16]: Anytime you can get the logs, just go from
this to this and just put as many places
[SPEAKER_16]: you can make a bed out of it, whatever,
but you got to stop the water from washing
[SPEAKER_16]: the tops all the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also just a side note, you know,
we can't look towards these huge
[SPEAKER_09]: organizations like Eventbrite.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, it's not great that they
told Emerald Cup at the 11th hour that
[SPEAKER_09]: they can't use it, but you know,
we don't really want those kinds of
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to start bumping up those
organizations that are going to help our
[SPEAKER_09]: community so we can help ourselves as
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully it's a gift in the end.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause it's like a lot of these Johnny come
lately mega corporations or banking
[SPEAKER_17]: institutions that at the 11th hour,
you know, are still kind of suppressing or
[SPEAKER_17]: repressing us.
[SPEAKER_17]: But then, you know, all of a sudden at
some point they're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_17]: oh yeah, we'll accept your money.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's like, dude, I wish there was
something more grassroots or community
[SPEAKER_17]: based where we could be like, yeah,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're subverting, you know, even having
any desire as a community to work with
[SPEAKER_17]: you, you know, because like, look what
you've done to our community since.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, this is not acceptable,
you know?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all the same, the cannabis industry
as it becomes recreational just because it
[SPEAKER_16]: becomes corporate and crazy.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it becomes a thing we don't even
recognize from where it started.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the disaster is on the ground.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's grassroots.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're helping soil King Patrick or anyone
else you can.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then all of a sudden you get into
these crazy organizations and really what
[SPEAKER_16]: it comes down to is we just have to make a
pact with the community and each other and
[SPEAKER_16]: just be willing to support each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we think that money is the real
commodity, but the truth, our own
[SPEAKER_09]: community is time is our real commodity.
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody even has like some shovels,
you know, we've got a month in November
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're going to come down, we're going
to go bring all of our tools and we have
[SPEAKER_09]: our skills.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're just going to go down to farms
and try to help build some shocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, that doesn't take a whole
lot of money to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we switch the idea of what our real
commodity is here in this community is
[SPEAKER_09]: giving each other the time.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm packing up the tools.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're tools.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're starting to love train.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go down and rebuild some
stuff down there for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that's that's the that's the
positive attitude that we needed today.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all it's all love.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure that people are going to need it
down there because holy shit, some pretty
[SPEAKER_11]: insane.
[SPEAKER_16]: We got to make it what we want it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as before, 20K would say bong rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time for a little where's my bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys, I got a lot of packages to get
ready to go to the mail tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to step off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for all you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before then, I'll see you guys next
week if we're still going.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for starting working with Wade as a
peer certified farmer who goes above and
[SPEAKER_16]: beyond what organic is and providing
medicine to your network in a pure form
[SPEAKER_16]: that's of respect to the earth.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're really, really excited to start
working.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he was so excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: He called me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, they're out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's getting certified.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just really attaches to people who
speak, you know, his language.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when he saw what you guys have on your
website and what we're talking about when
[SPEAKER_07]: you're out there, he's like, it's
everything I've been trying to say about
[SPEAKER_07]: sanctuary and creating the right
environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he's I know he's really stoked to
just meet some like minded folks through
[SPEAKER_07]: this process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll pass that on for him because I
hear it every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: He must have spotty Internet today because
I definitely sent him the link.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he's at a wedding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's at a celebration.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will see you next week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one, buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just letting my courts here cool
because it's about time to have a little
[SPEAKER_11]: rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got we've had some pretty serious
vibes today on church and we've had some
[SPEAKER_11]: fun vibes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So appreciate all the vibes.
[SPEAKER_16]: It is so good.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish you guys can smell it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lemon, lemon, lemon, meringue.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could smell that weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could join you for that rip
markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first hash church in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a part of and wasn't happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably a good idea while you're blasting
BHO in the background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait till we get home.
[SPEAKER_11]: This episode brought to you by glob moths.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brent sent me these recently.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always just used Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just I've always just used Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's constantly innovating.
[SPEAKER_11]: Make them pointier.
[SPEAKER_11]: Make them stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those glob moths are a pretty awesome tool
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: They let us get into some corners and
we're cleaning out valves and things like
[SPEAKER_05]: that that regular Q-tips don't quite do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also like a little tighter cotton
head.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been digging on the glob moths
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: A few years ago, I bought what I thought
were Q-tips and I tried them and it turned
[SPEAKER_13]: out the sticks were plastic.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a bummer man, a real bummer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like wooden ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I know how you like them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like your wooden ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: You used to have the wooden matches all
the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was one of the ways you could tell
skunk man Sam was at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could look down and see little wooden
matches and brand new stainless steel
[SPEAKER_11]: screens with like a single rip taken off
of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the craziest thing was this is a crazy
statement.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think of how fucked up this statement is.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you picked up those screens,
you would have you basically found the
[SPEAKER_11]: best product that you could find in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_11]: His burnt screens with like leftover
little bits of melt that maybe he didn't
[SPEAKER_11]: catch with the match.
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of moved over to the side of the
screen and he missed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was too busy just loading it up with a
new one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you, I will admit that I did
pick up a few of those screens.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: What a sad story for the rest of us
though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel that especially after squishing
this, where's my bike the other day?
[SPEAKER_11]: The bud and I have a little bit of the bud
here actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got a little bike here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can get it open.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll tell you, this is some of the
stickiest fucking bud I have had the
[SPEAKER_11]: pleasure of touching in a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was unbelievable sticky.
[SPEAKER_11]: The quality is so, I hope that it clicks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, come on camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me a click.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really not going to give me the love,
hey?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll take a picture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some macro photos.
[SPEAKER_05]: 30% yield on this bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it pretty well in your video,
but that's quite a bit more you've got
[SPEAKER_05]: there than this video.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on up Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get squishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might need to come up again for some of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hearing a lot about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you after breaking this butt
up with my hands, I was literally just in
[SPEAKER_11]: shock at how sticky it was through and
through.
[SPEAKER_11]: I photographed it with my macro lens.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was blown away at how much resin was
just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really just made me realize that a
lot of people are growing subpar cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we really owe it to,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're smiling and you're laughing,
but it's like, we need to call.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, if Chimera is going to call Indra
out and Jeremy's going to call soil
[SPEAKER_11]: balance out, I'm calling fucking everyone
out on their subpar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Living in BC, it's atrocities.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Weed that's cured and still sticky is like
magical.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, it's like space weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And whenever you see it, it's like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sadly to say it's, you know, few and far
between in my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I used to see it way more in the
nineties and I don't know what happened
[SPEAKER_11]: somewhere along the line.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just mainly here in BC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although when I travel, I find it even
harder to find in Jamaica now,
[SPEAKER_11]: whereas I used to be able to, it was used
to be hard, but now it's like this filter
[SPEAKER_11]: of this enormous amount of bunk weed that
you have to like sift through to get to
[SPEAKER_11]: people who are actually, and it's,
it's, it's pretty much the same every
[SPEAKER_11]: single time.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you finally meet the people who are
producing the absolute flame, they're
[SPEAKER_11]: super conscious.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have this whole idea of what's going
on from symbiotic relationships to like
[SPEAKER_11]: organic, to creating live soils,
to bacterias, to like the whole nine yards
[SPEAKER_11]: to actually processing the resin,
you know, in, in specific ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even from the processing of the resin
and curing the resin, even taking it as
[SPEAKER_11]: far as, you know, using that resin on a
very specific, I guess, type of heat
[SPEAKER_11]: source, whether it's convection or
conduction, whether it's titanium or
[SPEAKER_11]: quartz, whether it's sapphire or glass,
all of these different things seem to
[SPEAKER_11]: preserve the terpene profile differently,
you know, some more than others.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously if anyone's ever blasted any
type of dab onto a hot titanium nail,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know that the terpene profile pretty
much jumps out the window and just turns
[SPEAKER_11]: into this crazy like throat burning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't even know what it is,
but I'm sure the science behind it is
[SPEAKER_11]: fucked up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like those terpenes are being changed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything's being changed into a very
different, you know, compared to a super
[SPEAKER_11]: low temp like dab out of like Sabo's Vapix
Hail, which is like the convection.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's, it heats up differently with
the heat around it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I found the glass tube with the
quartz cylinder that slides in.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have one set up next Sunday
and I'll Vapix Hail the whole episode
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's one of the only units that
I've been able to hit pure terpenes off
[SPEAKER_11]: of, because people are like, can you hit
them pure?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, oh, no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I found that the Vapix Hail,
like a 10th of a drop, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: a 10th of 0.25 mLs put into the chamber
and at a nice low temperature.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is seriously one of the most beautiful,
[SPEAKER_11]: aromatherapeutic sort of ways of hitting
cannabis terpenes that I have ever come
[SPEAKER_11]: across it.
[SPEAKER_11]: None of these dishes or quartz compare.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just saying another really amazing
way to take in terps and get all of its
[SPEAKER_09]: medicinal compounds is to put it into soda
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just put a few drops into soda
water and like the bubbles from the CO2
[SPEAKER_09]: coming up in your face and drinking that
soda water, is a really great way to get
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: We found out, wow, you can make a whole
party giddy off of just giving out a bunch
[SPEAKER_09]: of terpenes in soda water.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just bubbling in your face.
[SPEAKER_16]: Terp bubbles when you're drinking it in
the suite.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: The person who called me out in chat
saying, let me read his call out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got to give everyone their five minutes of
fame here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone's calling me out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to let them call me out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chuckie Wagon.
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, he says, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_11]: Subpar says the guy in Canada who doesn't
even grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, currently I'm not growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: But have I grown cannabis in the last 25
years?
[SPEAKER_11]: Many, many a pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I have, I have a license to
produce federally cannabis here in my
[SPEAKER_11]: country in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last time I grew, I produced my
crop into five and six star resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't, I don't grow huge, but it's,
I don't find it impossible to learn.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of people even on this panel
for that matter who are willing to share
[SPEAKER_11]: their information.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's social media.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all these different websites.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of ways to learn how to grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it just takes a little bit of
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's as hard as maybe people
think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I think that maybe getting the right
genetics is, is difficult for some people
[SPEAKER_11]: that they might end up wasting their time
with a lot of wrong genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that people don't fully
understand the relationships between the
[SPEAKER_11]: plants and the soil and the food.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are, these can be fairly complex for
as simple as it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you gave the plant the right amount of
what it needs, but people make it complex,
[SPEAKER_11]: they can fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen people grow beautiful herb and
then destroy it in the cure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been here in BC for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been growing the whole time and
we'll back you up a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, it is really hard for us to
go outside of just the few people that we
[SPEAKER_09]: know and find something that we feel like
makes us feel good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, you know, you can have a lot of
techniques and you can have your practices
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can put in certain nutrients and
whatever products that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, this plant is a sentient
being and it feels our energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you have an energy about the
plant that you're, you're allying with
[SPEAKER_09]: this plant and it's a medicine for you,
it does grow better.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a fact.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes people just having a little
bit more intention towards their grows
[SPEAKER_09]: helps tremendously.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can remember on my first grow,
very small little grow, a couple of four
[SPEAKER_11]: hundreds, me and my buddy got these seeds
from a friend and we had a little hidden
[SPEAKER_11]: compartment.
[SPEAKER_11]: We would go sit in this little grow room
and just hang out with these seeds on a
[SPEAKER_11]: plate with the moist paper towel as we did
it back then.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where am I getting the feedback from?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that might be Indra.
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have to mute your mic,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of feedback coming in there,
but just hanging out in the room with
[SPEAKER_11]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And having that kind of passion.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for me, it was, you know, my passion
was always stemmed in trying to grow
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw a lot of my friends who went
into it also kind of wanting to grow
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible quality, but more the focus was
I'd like to make a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_11]: And not that that was a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: No one was looking down upon them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just definitely brings you to a
different result.
[SPEAKER_11]: If your result is to, you know,
really just make a bunch of money,
[SPEAKER_11]: you might find yourself in a different
place if your result was to just grow the
[SPEAKER_11]: best possible herb that you could produce.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the perfect expression that
those genetics are able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: the highest level of expression from
cannabinoid and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm looking for when I grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I never did it overly complex.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always tried to keep it organic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the more I was learning about soil,
the more, you know, the more intrigued I
[SPEAKER_11]: was by it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not something I know a ton.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I love having soil guys on the
show, people that want to talk about soil,
[SPEAKER_11]: soil women as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just soil guys, soil women.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry for that little division there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I got to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil people, we're all soil people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Humous beings.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, true enough.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me just, booyah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_16]: We grew some of our best weeds.
[SPEAKER_16]: This year because of natural systems.
[SPEAKER_16]: And even though we have products,
you know, grow our grow based off
[SPEAKER_16]: products.
[SPEAKER_16]: We grow our, we make our grow based off
nature.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we, I mean, if you go into the forest
and pick up, you know, a handful of soil,
[SPEAKER_16]: there's billions of microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no product that comes close to
billions.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can get products and you can do
indoors and you can mimic and bio mimic
[SPEAKER_16]: and do everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_16]: But nothing compares to just being able to
create this crazy environment with all
[SPEAKER_16]: this biomass and everything, just feeding
organisms and getting organisms from all
[SPEAKER_16]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had the best time this year,
really using hay, dirt and weed water.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a phenomenal, amazing growth.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and a lot of love and attention and
observation.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's not like we just plant it and
go to bed and wake up and harvest and be
[SPEAKER_16]: like, check it out.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time is the commodity.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we, we use washes and predator
mites, you know, to make sure that our
[SPEAKER_16]: everything stays clean and we don't have
to mess with invasive oils or different
[SPEAKER_16]: things that make it even stop it from
growing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're always in this really beautiful
immune boosting style growth, which we're
[SPEAKER_16]: just getting amazing results out of.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just so fun to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also you were talking about money,
you know, and when we're growing a plant
[SPEAKER_09]: for money, a lot of times it's the knee
jerk reaction that gets us into trouble
[SPEAKER_09]: because people that have a lot of money on
the line and something goes wrong with
[SPEAKER_09]: their crop, then they have to come up with
a solution ASAP.
[SPEAKER_09]: So their solution sometimes is not a
holistic solution.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very allopathic solution because it
goes right to the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes like, oh boy, we've got a mite
issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get rid of the mites rather than
looking at it as a real holistic way,
[SPEAKER_09]: because they might not be able to have the
time or the resources to be able to look
[SPEAKER_09]: at it in a more holistic view.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really implore people out there,
you know, that do have money on the line.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to spend a lot more money
when you're looking at it as an
[SPEAKER_09]: allopathic, you know, solution.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're feeling like one thing is going
to take care of it, it's going to cost you
[SPEAKER_09]: more money in the long run.
[SPEAKER_18]: Being in a reactive position instead of a
proactive one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's, I've seen it too many
times, people being in desperate
[SPEAKER_11]: situations to save their crops.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just like, definitely the
situations, the choices that they make,
[SPEAKER_11]: even some fairly conscious individuals
I've known in the past have made some
[SPEAKER_11]: fairly unconscious decisions to keep that
crop, you know, to get that crop to a
[SPEAKER_11]: level where it's still a sellable product.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just like, not my idea.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it actually sellable or does it just
sell?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, because selling once again is
there, it's a form of manipulative
[SPEAKER_11]: assumption, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, that's why the person
selling you the bud wants to say,
[SPEAKER_11]: look at the crystals, look how crystal
that shit is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you feel that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at how nice those buds are.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know what, you go away and
I just want to look at this herb.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't need to be sold the herb,
you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, that's what it's been so
fascinating kind of up to this point.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been such a like showmanship,
salesmanship kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, up to this point,
you know, where, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_17]: even though so much of what has been out
there and being hustled isn't organic and
[SPEAKER_17]: hasn't been clean, but, you know,
being able to talk the lingo and kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, stand in front of like a
procurement specialist at a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_17]: if you can, you know, eloquently,
like, you know, baffle people bullshit
[SPEAKER_17]: about, you know, compost teas and like,
you know, all this stuff that you use,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, up to this point, you've been
able to kind of, you know, get by and
[SPEAKER_17]: almost fake the funk and, you know,
kind of get whatever price.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I mean, just as everything
is shifting more and more in the consumer
[SPEAKER_17]: marketplace and, you know, the kind of B2B
marketplace has become more, I guess,
[SPEAKER_17]: educated and there's these different
analytical tools to substantiate quality,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, it's becoming less easy to fake
the funk, you know, and it's fascinating
[SPEAKER_17]: because, you know, at this point,
just since there's such a flood of
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis, like particularly in California,
you know, it's like if it's not A++ and,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, because anything I feel like
that's like that cured and still sticky
[SPEAKER_17]: reality, you know, it's almost gone,
you know, when people see it, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: without even having to sell it or...
Poster bud.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, exactly, but if it's anything less
than that, I mean, the market is drying up
[SPEAKER_17]: more and more, quicker and quicker,
you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question for you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the highest percentage of terpenes
you found in herbal cannabis?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, what's interesting is typically
we see kind of on average, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: the highest is kind of around,
you know, I mean, like on average,
[SPEAKER_17]: what we see is, you know, two and a half
to three, three and a half percent kind
[SPEAKER_17]: of, you know, has always been the,
you know, kind of, you know, where it
[SPEAKER_17]: peaks out, but what's really interesting
is certain genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: like we've seen continuously kind of,
you know, able to come back at like five
[SPEAKER_17]: plus percent, you know, I mean,
and what's really trippy about that is
[SPEAKER_17]: like we have these certain genetics,
you know, that we see, like whenever
[SPEAKER_17]: somebody will send it in a test,
we'll have to kind of go through like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, two to three different repreps
on the bud to kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: confirm the result, because if anything
kind of tests above our, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: we have these like high marks where,
you know, or, you know, these outlier,
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess, marks where if it's above that,
you know, then it almost immediately part
[SPEAKER_17]: of our quality system, it immediately kind
of triggers us to reprep and reanalyze it
[SPEAKER_17]: and have more, you know, eyes on those
results.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the numbers you're talking totally
makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did terpene analysis for years and we
got quite a bit of numbers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really good to hear actually,
because yeah, I mean, it's like it's
[SPEAKER_17]: puzzling to see most all herb,
you know, when it's cured perfectly and
[SPEAKER_17]: dried perfectly, and, you know,
it kind of comes around three,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, three ish percent plus minus,
you know, but then certain strange is
[SPEAKER_17]: bound is whack it at, you know,
five plus percent, six percent.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just like, wow, that's insane,
you know, but yeah, I mean, it's that's
[SPEAKER_17]: that's definitely it's definitely a
fascinating thing, you know, and with with
[SPEAKER_17]: this terpene classification system that
we've we've been creating, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: we, you know, part of it, you know,
we, you know, we created this like outlier
[SPEAKER_17]: trigger where, you know, if some if any
strain that we pass through this algorithm
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of has, you know, some anomalously
high terpenes or certain terpenes that
[SPEAKER_17]: never really expressed themselves,
you know, in you know, 98% of the data
[SPEAKER_17]: set, you know, kind of they get flagged as
an outlier for secondary review.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, I'm really excited about
this outlier flag because it kind of you
[SPEAKER_17]: know, educates us on like when there's
true novelty, but also when, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: certain things happen where there might be
some possible internal lab error by,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, an analyst that might be,
you know, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: misidentifying a colluding peak or
something.
[SPEAKER_17]: But but what's interesting is when what we
noticed whenever, you know, we were going
[SPEAKER_17]: through and doing, you know, kind of a lot
of analysis around the outliers,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, we, we, we saw that,
you know, tremendously this amount of them
[SPEAKER_17]: were kind of, you know, swag.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so so we kind of created what we're
calling like a swag flag, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and and so a swag flag, basically is,
you know, what we see is like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, if it has less than 0.75% total
terpene concentration, and it's got,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, certain higher boiling point
terpenes as the dominant primary terpenes,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, because, you know, typically,
what we see is, you know, primary terpenes
[SPEAKER_17]: will, you know, you know, are all
typically mono terps, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: so like are the samples fresh?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, oftentimes, you know, oftentimes,
they'll either be fresh leaf, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: where phytol will be like a dominant
terpene.
[SPEAKER_17]: But but in, in the times where there's
like, what we're calling swag flag,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's it'll be basically below 0.75%.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it'll have a combination, you know,
so and it won't have pretty much any of
[SPEAKER_17]: the primary terpenes or any, or any of
the, you know, primary mono terps like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, pining, terpenaline,
limonene, miracene.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it'll also not really have a
whole lot of the sesquiterps, which we see
[SPEAKER_17]: very common, which are beta carotene and
humuline.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so so you know, what we see is in the
huge, it seems like about like 5% of our
[SPEAKER_17]: total data set, or no, I'm sorry,
about 10% of our total data set,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, when passed through this
algorithm kind of hit, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: basically what we're calling swag flag.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that'll be basically less than
0.75%.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it'll have the following terpenes as
the primary terpenes in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that'll be basically guaiol,
nerolidol, bisbolol, and like
[SPEAKER_17]: karyophylline oxide.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it'll be these alls, ol as the last
terps.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, my dogs are freaking out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I gotta run.
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_11]: The dogs were like, No, we can't let this
terp knowledge drop go down.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just gonna have to hold back for a
second.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I think that it's interesting
that you know, in the wine world,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is a very old industry, you know,
it's been happening for a very long time
[SPEAKER_09]: with legality and acceptance by community,
you know, we're not really talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: the percentage of alcohol, we're not
talking about the percentage of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, sugars that are in it,
or all of the different terpenes that are
[SPEAKER_09]: in it, you know, it's really come down to
maybe because it's a more mature industry,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure, but it's come down to how
does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_09]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_09]: And how does it smell?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just really interesting that
we've gone in all different kinds of
[SPEAKER_13]: gametes with the cannabis industry,
people buy the varieties that they like a
[SPEAKER_13]: Chardonnay's or a red wine or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all based on the terpenes,
etc.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just interesting that we don't test
them scientifically, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's something that people people know
from experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a we need the cannabis sommelier
kit with all the different That's what
[SPEAKER_11]: we're saying.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be nice to invigorate that more
within our community.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like hard to do, but it's important
and I would love to see more of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The labs can't tell you how it makes you
feel.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we can we can take guesses on
what those terpenes are supposed to make
[SPEAKER_09]: you feel.
[SPEAKER_16]: But consumers have to buy based off
numbers, you know, people that you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: we all have really different cannabinoid
receptor systems.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's actually the same with wine.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you drink a Chardonnay,
you're going to expect it to be similar to
[SPEAKER_13]: the other Chardonnays.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's just experience when people
have enough experience with knowing what
[SPEAKER_13]: particular you know, if it's say 20% THC
in a particular terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_13]: it will cause these effects with the
different terpene profile, it will cause
[SPEAKER_13]: those effects.
Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it also comes down to terroir.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that Chardonnay terroir in France is
going to be different than the one in
[SPEAKER_16]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_16]: And people know that and that's a more
mature industry in that sense where we can
[SPEAKER_16]: be like, oh, we of course we know the dirt
in that area and what it's going to affect
[SPEAKER_16]: on the flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the terpenes are going to be affected
by the soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, terroir is a bit funny with cannabis
because so much of it is grown in man-made
[SPEAKER_13]: soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not really terroir if it's man-made
soil, is it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sorry if I may jump into it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had to scoot off.
[SPEAKER_17]: My dog is just barking.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just wanted to finish the point,
you know, because it wasn't just to make
[SPEAKER_17]: the point about Schwagg flag.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a pretty, you know, that was a
really interesting finding because we saw
[SPEAKER_17]: in Schwagg in these certain, you know,
subset of samples, you know, it'll have
[SPEAKER_17]: less than X percent, you know,
about 0.75% total terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And most of the mono and sesquiterpenes
that are the primary terpenes that
[SPEAKER_17]: distinguish most smell of, you know,
the primary and secondary terpenes that
[SPEAKER_17]: virtually any strain that we have tested
in California has, you know, it'll then
[SPEAKER_17]: concentrate these certain other
supposedly, you know, I guess,
[SPEAKER_17]: non-desirable or more highly or boiling
point terpenes that are more, I guess,
[SPEAKER_17]: distinguishing of, you know, Schwagg,
I guess, in that sense, because,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, pretty much, you know,
things, you know, things like I was
[SPEAKER_17]: saying, like, you know, caroalkaline
oxide, phytol, nerolidol, alpha-bisbolol,
[SPEAKER_17]: those, what we see to a really high degree
is, you know, when those concentrations of
[SPEAKER_17]: terpenes in this below 0.75% and you
verify kind of on the pictures and
[SPEAKER_17]: everything like that, it's typically like,
yeah, really old kind of degraded
[SPEAKER_17]: material, probably sat around for a really
long time, you know, but once we kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, in this outlier kind of
grouping, when we, you know, started to
[SPEAKER_17]: differentiate and see that there are,
you know, there's a need for the Schwagg
[SPEAKER_17]: flag, we also identified, you know,
the need for like what's, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's not the name of it,
but what we're tentatively calling like a
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuego flag.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's when something's like
incredibly above average in total terpenes
[SPEAKER_17]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what we see with that is,
you know, kind of, you know, about 5% of
[SPEAKER_17]: our total data set, you know, will
basically be above 3.5% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, you know, the primary
mono-terpenes that are present in that
[SPEAKER_17]: will just be soaring, you know,
things again, like alpha-pinene,
[SPEAKER_17]: terpenelene, miracene, limonene,
and, you know, in strains that are like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, cookies and sherbet and stuff,
that'll be beta-caroalkaline dominant,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is more on a sesquiterpene level.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, a very small subset of
these samples will be in that above 3.5%.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, in that, we see up to
five, six plus percent total concentration
[SPEAKER_17]: for these very specific strains,
which kind of correlate kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: yeah, I mean, there's the component to how
it was grown environmentally, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and of course, how it was kind of dried
and cured post-harvested.
[SPEAKER_17]: But certain strains, you know,
when grown and harvested, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: whether indoor or outdoor, seem
genetically to have a propensity to
[SPEAKER_17]: overall test higher in total
concentration.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then others that might just cap out at a
certain percent, even when they're dried
[SPEAKER_17]: and cured perfectly.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, it's pretty interesting because
with, you know, kind of just, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: with, I guess, Sam, you were asking,
you know, it's interesting how certain
[SPEAKER_17]: genetics will basically have that ability.
[SPEAKER_17]: But then, you know, it's also really
interesting to us how, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: we test, you know, 30, I think it's like
33 or 34 total terpenes at this point,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, we, in the future, eventually
we'll be kind of testing for different
[SPEAKER_17]: alcohol esters and flavonoids,
but of the 33 terpenes that we test for,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, pretty much there's about five
to nine that ever show up in any real
[SPEAKER_17]: significant concentration.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the primary terpenes that distinguish
most smell and how well it comes out in
[SPEAKER_17]: virtually all strains we test,
you know, really are these, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: four or five mono-terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's pretty much what we found.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we would test for, we had about 100
standards at the maximum.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we used to find a little over 50
terpenes in measurable amounts in the
[SPEAKER_13]: average cannabis variety we tested.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, but as far as like, you know,
75 to 80% of the concentration,
[SPEAKER_17]: did you see more than, you know,
those five or five, nine?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, there's maybe nine or 10 or 11 that
were common, like you say.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the rest of them are seldom found and
seldom in large amounts.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's really interesting what we see,
but what's really kind of cool about all
[SPEAKER_17]: that is in so many ways, I think that
really provides a roadmap to help,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, identify terpenes as the number
one metric to determine quality and how
[SPEAKER_17]: well something was dried and cured and how
well the terroir was brought out in the
[SPEAKER_17]: strain in the environment, you know,
and just being able to use as a
[SPEAKER_17]: comparative.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you don't want just terpenes,
you want the right terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody has a different opinion what
those right terpenes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great point, as far as all the
statistics that were being thrown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to point this back to
Peter and let him know, that's why I
[SPEAKER_02]: called out his terpene analysis,
as far as advertising the soil balance
[SPEAKER_02]: pro, because the numbers he was seeing as
average for the industry were far below
[SPEAKER_02]: swag, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the numbers brought up were still
below that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are the types of data that if
you share with your customers and
[SPEAKER_02]: correlated to the product, I think would
be much more received.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw the terpene test, whatever
numbers, it was way off from this
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation that seemed more accurate to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to relay that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to say, I just want to say for
everyone who's listening, here at Kind
[SPEAKER_08]: Roots, we pride ourselves on being an
honest, conscious and transparent
[SPEAKER_08]: corporation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there are probably still some
questions out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for anyone who's watching overseas,
this later, we welcome you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send us your questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Contact us on our website.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's soilbalancepro.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a contact form there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll make sure and answer all of your
questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to be as transparent as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're here to make this industry
better.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeremy, thank you for making sure that
we're tightening up our ship.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super excited to be working with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that you'll even consider mentoring
us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to work with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And be partners and work together in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so again, thank you for making sure
that we've got our ship together.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll address the terpene question just
really quick.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the grower who got 0.4 terpene,
that was their lab, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So the lab here in Arizona, when they
tested it, his terpenes were 0.4%.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so after he used our product,
he went up to 1.5%.
[SPEAKER_18]: And total terpenes.
[SPEAKER_18]: And there were eight different types.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I was really proud of that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know some guys are hitting 3%,
4%, and 6%, and 8%, which is epic,
[SPEAKER_18]: man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Their biology must be incredible.
[SPEAKER_18]: So hands off to those guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: But this gentleman wasn't one of those
guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: He was just like a regular grower.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he had been growing kind of in his
home.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he was like blown away by the increase
to get close to 2%.
[SPEAKER_18]: We were proud of that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's kind of where we came.
[SPEAKER_18]: But what was cool about the tests was that
there was six or seven different types of
[SPEAKER_18]: terpenes instead of just the three spikes
that you normally see.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we thought that was pretty unique as
well.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why we showed the data.
[SPEAKER_18]: But one thing, because we both kind of
have to get going.
[SPEAKER_18]: And one thing I did want to talk to Jeremy
about is I feel like our microbes really
[SPEAKER_18]: benefit your amendments.
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like your amendments would benefit
us.
[SPEAKER_18]: As well, and the growers that we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you're putting out some great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've heard great things about your
product.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I hope that we can kind of shake
hands, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you try and work together in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's kind of like Dragonfly was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a synergy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our product also, if the microbes come
together and work as a team, they're much
[SPEAKER_18]: more effective in helping this world.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what we're all here to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got to take care of nature,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Our fucking planet is dying.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's time for us to come together,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: And settle our differences, which I would
really like to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: And explain everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if anybody has questions, come to the
site.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is time for balancing our soil,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's time like Dragonfly was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_18]: That biology, that synergy, that what
they're working with that life is why
[SPEAKER_18]: they're helping the people, the fire
victims.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're giving organisms.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what we want to be.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'd love to support you, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we appreciate you from many different
levels.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm humbled by your work for the last
three years helping organic farmers,
[SPEAKER_18]: man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm impressed by you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're really doing seriously.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I will say that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you an organic gardener there,
Bill, to soil?
[SPEAKER_11]: You currently growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: All day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a live demonstration right in our
retail store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you can actually see that we
practice what we preach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do side by side demonstrations
right there on the retail floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also demonstrate some of our customers,
as well as our own personal gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very transparent in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always interested in the base
route of transparency of products that I
[SPEAKER_02]: can share the results with other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm looking at the microorganisms
there, at least on the list that I find,
[SPEAKER_02]: I find more affordable sources for similar
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of what they might
be able to provide is proprietary at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me to work forward with any
products, I need a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'd be a lot more likely to
work with Dragonfly's products based on
[SPEAKER_02]: their transparency than I would be with
the soil balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean it's going to
permanently be that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was more transparency in all the
specialty ingredients, I could balance
[SPEAKER_02]: that against my budget in the marketplace
with other products that may or may not
[SPEAKER_02]: have those same ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how I operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect everyone to operate that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everyone goes down to the individual
level and cares what they may or may not
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to do locally with other
producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's definitely a place for
maybe a longer, more drawn out
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I think that we've
seen a lot of change on there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, where are you located, Jeremy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Montrose, which is on the western
slope.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't even sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of cool that I asked for this
three times, and I haven't gotten a
[SPEAKER_18]: response to it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to have some third-party
independent lab test some of the
[SPEAKER_18]: build-a-soil microbes against our
microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any microbes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Or products.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as far as transparency,
every organic material out there,
[SPEAKER_18]: especially soil, is going to have over
1,000 different strains of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it'd be interesting to see what... When
they're formulated in the lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're usually individually formulated
and then mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just love me to be the
manufacturer of the products I research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me that info.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a challenge with labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even one of my favorite older products,
EM1, you would have to explain what's
[SPEAKER_02]: really in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does SC Labs do testing like that,
Alec?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you guys ever tested for...
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't do soil microbiology microbial
analysis.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know of a couple labs that I can post
up.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know one in southern Oregon,
one that has a lot of soil food web stuff
[SPEAKER_17]: for the Elaine Ingham team.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't think of it at the top of my mind,
but I do know of a couple different labs I
[SPEAKER_17]: can post on the thread.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, nonetheless, the offer's there,
Jeremy, if you'd ever like to work with
[SPEAKER_18]: us.
[SPEAKER_18]: We want it, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: We respect what you do.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you guys for the space.
[SPEAKER_18]: Marcus, thanks for coming out of
retirement.
[SPEAKER_18]: Super grateful to you, Matt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for coming in for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's almost 1130.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had... What is Sam in an LED grow room
now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I moved locations into one of the
grow rooms here at ECC.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were talking about subpar
cannabis being grown like half an hour
[SPEAKER_05]: ago, so I figured I'd come in here and
show some of our subpar cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it looking pretty stacked, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these are just in like week four,
so they're not looking super huge yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But growing under these LED lights really
seems to help with their tropine synthesis
[SPEAKER_05]: and comparing them to like Aveda's and a
few other lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see like two and a half times the
tropine development out of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these are some kind LEDs.
[SPEAKER_17]: Those look pretty stacked for week four,
man.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, yeah, LEDs, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I worked in the hydroponic
industry for a few years before we opened
[SPEAKER_17]: up SC Labs, and everybody was almost
seeing so much about LED technology and
[SPEAKER_17]: what had the potential to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was always like an unfounded claim,
but just seeing some of the new kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: LED kind of setups like these days,
it seems like it's actually starting to
[SPEAKER_17]: rifter kind of and comparable kind of to a
lot of the HD double-ended bulb like
[SPEAKER_17]: reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely seems like it's getting
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked at a previous facility that
didn't have nearly this quality of LEDs,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think our yield is almost double
here, but the yield is still not quite
[SPEAKER_05]: what like a gametus can put out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might be looking to do like a
mixture of different kinds of lighting for
[SPEAKER_05]: our next growth that we do, but still
looking into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again for bringing me aboard,
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to take off too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got our run done, and I think Andrew
just dipped out, but I wanted to thank him
[SPEAKER_05]: for the discussion today, and hopefully we
can have some more of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for the poor quality tools I have,
but I'm just working with what every other
[SPEAKER_05]: extract technician making oil worldwide is
using.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I appreciate you sharing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, it's not my preferred
method, but hey, you offered to share,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I thought that why not?
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like a nice thing to share.
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate the grow room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hi to your partner for us,
and I'm sure we'll see you again soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having us, B-Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was a very eclectic church today.
[SPEAKER_11]: All sorts of different things going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: We lost Chimera fairly early on.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said the funniest thing when he left.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said something like, well, I guess it's
all rainbows and unicorns, everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was just funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: He came in super aggressive.
[SPEAKER_11]: In his defense, yes, lots of people have
been like, yeah, when are we going to see
[SPEAKER_11]: this unit that Andrew's been talking about
for two years on Hash Church?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess probably sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he came out.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, whoa, come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a sales thing or are we going to
see that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he was just like, he's Chimera,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love him for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I dig all the different vibes.
[SPEAKER_12]: All he wants to see is the science,
which I completely back.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think all of us will completely
back.
[SPEAKER_12]: All we want to do is see the science.
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk is talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bullshit is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_12]: We see more bullshit.
[SPEAKER_12]: In this industry and have for decades.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why we look for science now to
separate the wheat from the chaff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, you know, I look forward to
seeing the science because from the talk,
[SPEAKER_12]: the science is apparently is there and the
science should actually back it up,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: I just do.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just going to say too.
[SPEAKER_17]: And on that note, you know, I mean,
just kind of hearing kind of, uh,
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I'm, I'm a little kind of new to,
you know, some, some of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of back and forth about the soil
balance and kind of that whole
[SPEAKER_17]: conversation and, and, you know,
but, but I mean, that's, that's the thing,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the science on its own,
you know, has to step up significantly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, it's like, there's a lot of,
you know, quote science and analytical
[SPEAKER_17]: labs doing testing, but there's also a lot
of kind of inconsistency and inability to
[SPEAKER_17]: compare apples to apples from within the
analytical lab community, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And so for what it's worth, we're,
you know, we're really excited kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: here in California and how kind of
California is following Oregon and how
[SPEAKER_17]: Oregon kind of, you know, really set the
standard in a bit of a way because,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, unlike Colorado and Washington,
you know, who kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of set the path and regulation and
how kind of lab testing and all that is
[SPEAKER_17]: part of a regulated market, you know,
in Oregon, you know, what they did is they
[SPEAKER_17]: realized that, you know, it's almost like
the chicken's garden, the hen house in a
[SPEAKER_17]: bit of a way.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause it's like, if, if you're going to
have robust regulations on people that are
[SPEAKER_17]: producing cannabis from the farm level to
producing extracts, to making infused
[SPEAKER_17]: products, you know, you almost have to
have even strict or kind of regulations on
[SPEAKER_17]: the labs.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so kind of, you know, in Oregon,
they basically required labs, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: that are doing testing to not only,
you know, to basically have full ISO 17
[SPEAKER_17]: 025 accreditation on every single assay
that they offered the public, but then,
[SPEAKER_17]: but then further each lab has to go
through routine kind of proficiency
[SPEAKER_17]: testing on the state level to demonstrate
that they're able to do this, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: repeatable and accurate, precise testing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause you know, it's like if one lab,
if, you know, if they're kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, kind of testing and showing,
you know, they're, they haven't fully gone
[SPEAKER_17]: through method, formal method validation
on their terpene run.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and, you know, they're, they're not
fully co, you know, kind of resolving the,
[SPEAKER_17]: their peaks and having coal looting
terpenes or, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: misidentifying compounds, you know,
the data kind of isn't able to be held up
[SPEAKER_17]: like as, you know, strong and comparable
to, you know, lab data in one area or
[SPEAKER_17]: another area.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, I think it's,
I think progress within the industry is,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, kind of really great.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think regulations, you know,
kind of in each state and the way each
[SPEAKER_17]: state has been building off the last,
you know, are going to just, if anything,
[SPEAKER_17]: they're going to strengthen kind of the,
the science and analytics that people can
[SPEAKER_17]: use and trust and kind of further dial and
develop what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, the, the, the, you know,
the strong shall persevere and those that
[SPEAKER_17]: aren't able to kind of meet the muster are
going to be not able to even sell their
[SPEAKER_17]: testing on.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so I think it's going to really step
up the game for everybody and it's going
[SPEAKER_17]: to, you know, create strong kind of
analytics.
[SPEAKER_17]: That then, you know, will be comparable
from, you know, state to state or lab to
[SPEAKER_17]: lab, you know, and, and I think,
I think everybody welcomes that because I
[SPEAKER_17]: think that might be one of the biggest
frustrations across the entire community
[SPEAKER_17]: is like, okay, this lab shows these
numbers and that lab shows these numbers,
[SPEAKER_17]: which lab's full of shit, which lab's
right.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if anything, it kind of creates a
massive distrust from within the,
[SPEAKER_17]: from across the industry because like
nobody really knows, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and, and then, you know, there's a lot of
hearsay and, you know, everybody's got,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, team this lab or team that lab.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and there's these loyalties,
but it's like, you know, I think,
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it'll all kind of, you know,
lay out accordingly with testing regs and,
[SPEAKER_17]: and whenever that happens, you know,
big ups to any lab that's able to meet
[SPEAKER_17]: those, those, those requirements.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause you know, no labs, I mean,
just like kind of cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, no crop has ever been regulated
as much as cannabis is about to be in any
[SPEAKER_17]: agricultural sector in the United States.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's going to be really
fascinating what comes from it,
[SPEAKER_17]: but, but also on the lab level,
you know, no lab has ever been regulated
[SPEAKER_17]: to where they have to have such wide
accreditation on every aspect of their
[SPEAKER_17]: service and then further proficient
testing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, I think, you know,
those that, you know, Well, not only
[SPEAKER_12]: further proficient testing, you're going
to have to deal with bulk testing on top
[SPEAKER_12]: of that, because it's no longer going to
be just a few of us testing everyone's
[SPEAKER_12]: testing, which means your load is also in
everybody's load is going to grow
[SPEAKER_12]: exponentially, you know, so it's going to
be a growth spurt all the way around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is going to be interesting,
interestingly to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you know, talking about labs,
as far as testing of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes and all of that, you know,
testing soil is, is incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're testing biology of soil,
but are we testing the sociology of the
[SPEAKER_09]: soil?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we testing what happens, you know,
when you put it into different
[SPEAKER_09]: environments, as soon as you take a soil
out of one environment and put it into a
[SPEAKER_09]: different environment, it changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, you know, just to add,
we're dealing with an adaptive genetic
[SPEAKER_09]: plant, so she's going to outsmart us every
single time, you know, you can find
[SPEAKER_16]: different tests results on different parts
of the plant, right, like top to bottom,
[SPEAKER_16]: inside, outside.
[SPEAKER_16]: What have you found on that, Alec?
[SPEAKER_17]: So much of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, from what we see, so much of that
has to do with like cultivation method
[SPEAKER_17]: with the way the plants are pruned.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if you got like a 14 foot tall
outdoor plant that's never been pruned and
[SPEAKER_17]: it's just completely shading any light
from, you know, exposing within the
[SPEAKER_17]: canopy, you know, yeah, we can we can see
from one part of the bud or one part of
[SPEAKER_17]: the plant to, you know, top buds,
you know, say 10, 12% variance from bud to
[SPEAKER_17]: bud.
[SPEAKER_17]: But whenever we see, you know,
very effective kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of, you know, management of kind of
canopy and, you know, kind of pruning,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, and, you know, helping to expose
light to all areas of the plant,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, all of a sudden gets to the
point where, you know, we see tremendously
[SPEAKER_17]: less variance, you know, that,
you know, kind of, you know, the couple
[SPEAKER_17]: percent plus or minus, you know,
at the most and and, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and so much of that also depends on
whether or not it's grown indoor or
[SPEAKER_17]: outdoor, you know, there's no mimicking
the sun, you know, and so distance
[SPEAKER_17]: traveled from the sun to get to the bud,
whether it's top or middle bottom,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, is very little difference,
you know, so then it's so much of it is
[SPEAKER_17]: about how you're pruning and growing your
plants as opposed to indoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: where every foot below the bulb is such an
exponential loss in lumens that,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, kind of, you know, it compounds,
you know, especially then on how well the
[SPEAKER_17]: canopy is kind of grown out or,
you know, or completely forested,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, then, you know, we see much
higher variance, I guess, in those cases,
[SPEAKER_17]: whenever something is indoor and,
you know, grown under HID lighting and
[SPEAKER_17]: then not pruned well, so but, you know,
just wrapping the point, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: but then like same thing with indoor,
whenever people are using like
[SPEAKER_17]: double-ended bulb technology and have
really effective kind of pruning and,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, keeping of their plants and how
they haircut and do all the things,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, then like we see like almost no
variance from, you know, small to middle
[SPEAKER_17]: to bottom or, you know, to top,
but so much of that's how, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: people are growing their plants and,
you know, kind of ongoingly, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and actively taking care of pruning and
such.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, going back to the lab thing in
regards to, you know, a lab makes a
[SPEAKER_11]: mistake or has an error occur and it's
like, it's true, people really like,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's not like being a weatherman where you
can be wrong half the time, like it's like
[SPEAKER_11]: having that those little differences
really causes this sort of like doubt in
[SPEAKER_11]: the community distrust and it's,
you're right, you see them picking sides
[SPEAKER_11]: and welcome back to Chimera.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's you, Chimera?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, I mean, I had to come back to
clear my name from being mistaken.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did we say?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm surprised he's even brave enough to
show his face again.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I mean, I just don't, I don't think
that would be an aggressive, I think I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: just, I like to call it like it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dude, listen, everyone in the chat I
didn't see one person going, fuck Chimera.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one person might've said that it
was a bit pompous, but you had most people
[SPEAKER_11]: behind you, so.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, again, it's not about popular
opinion, I'm just like, I gotta say my
[SPEAKER_15]: piece, that's just what I'm doing,
you know, whether it's popular or not,
[SPEAKER_15]: so.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If, you know, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaks for the trees, you speak for the
science.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, with the judo chop.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I speak for the trees,
you get to speak for the science.
[SPEAKER_15]: I take that as a huge compliment,
and you know, I really, again,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's nothing against Andra, I don't have a
thing for Andra, I don't have a hate on
[SPEAKER_15]: for him in any way.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just at a certain point in time,
I mean, it's like, it could be a car,
[SPEAKER_15]: it could be a grow light, it could be
anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, when the guy that's pushing the
technology that he's got a vested interest
[SPEAKER_15]: in is the one that's saying, trust me,
you gotta take my word for it,
[SPEAKER_15]: no, you can't say any results,
no, you can't have it, see the process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's a little bit too Wizard of Oz
for me, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit too Barnum and Bailey.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, let's be honest, there's no shortage
of Barnum and Bailey's in this business,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're at the point now where we're a
transition from stoner lore and claims to
[SPEAKER_15]: science-based evidence, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we gotta move into that world
and embrace that world.
[SPEAKER_15]: And not take it as an insult or a
criticism when someone says, hey,
[SPEAKER_15]: justify your claims, hey, show us how
you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, you know, even if it's a patented
machine or whatever, like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_15]: Replicatable science stands on its own.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not enough to just say take my word
for it and buy my shit, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: At least it's not enough for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_13]: I copyrighted pro science.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's telling me it's a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not enough to say take my word for
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's why we love you, Chimera,
because you just say it how it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've known you frigging, God, it's gotta
be 20 years, which is, or 18 or 19 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where does one get rainbows and unicorn
farts?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, when you said that, when you left the
chat room, dude, I laughed my head off.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace, love, rainbows and unicorns,
man.
[SPEAKER_15]: And hey, I love rainbows and unicorns as
much as the next guy, but like,
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not buying stuff from him.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't get wholesale rainbows.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of today what the whole episode
was really to be about, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: just people like, and that's the thing
about church, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome to come on here,
but people will call you on shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you come on here and say certain
things, you'll be, you know, you're in a
[SPEAKER_11]: room full of people who tend to know their
shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: To a certain level.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have someone at my door.
[SPEAKER_11]: Please all continue.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, if Andrew's watching, you know,
I like Andrew.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the things that he's done and I
want to believe in his technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if he's got it and he's doing it,
then that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I encourage him to do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at a certain point in time,
you know, we all got to stand up and show
[SPEAKER_15]: what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we want people to buy in and we're not
talking about small buy-ins.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, these are like 50, a hundred
thousand dollar machines.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, when people are going to lay down
that kind of money, that's okay that they
[SPEAKER_15]: ask questions and you don't, you don't
just have to take somebody else's word for
[SPEAKER_15]: it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, come here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Will you be at the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope I'll be down there, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you get asked to speak?
[SPEAKER_15]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, I'm around.
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought for sure that we had you on a
panel.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me double check that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll get back to you this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was just down there actually.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just down in San Diego in LA
checking out these, this new Fluence
[SPEAKER_15]: lighting technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you guys have heard of
these things.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you know, that's, we were just
checking out and I was just kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: speaking to some of the LED stuff and how,
where it was and the promise of it and
[SPEAKER_17]: where it's come and, and, you know,
Fluence is actually on the, on the tier
[SPEAKER_17]: of, of, of some of the lighting I've seen.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know people that have been utilizing
that are kind of actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: showing to be pretty comparative to,
you know, some of the highest end HID
[SPEAKER_17]: lighting, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, I mean, I haven't seen it
personally through kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: running a grow on my own with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'm, you know, just, I've just up,
I've historically been very skeptical
[SPEAKER_17]: about LED because I've seen kind of where
it started, you know, and, and how much
[SPEAKER_17]: promise there was with it and whenever
there was a lot of, you know, over promise
[SPEAKER_17]: and under delivering, I guess.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, but yeah, I mean, from people I know
that are actively running Fluence,
[SPEAKER_17]: they're stoked.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and apparently, yeah, it's crushing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the flowers, listen, I went to a
facility, these MedMan guys, I don't know
[SPEAKER_15]: if you know this MedMan crew down there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went, went and checked out their show in
Burbank and
[SPEAKER_15]: it was, I mean, it was, it was pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: They got, they got these stacked systems
they're doing with like these,
[SPEAKER_15]: these racks, essentially, like it's
vertical farming style with a couple of,
[SPEAKER_15]: a couple of layers of flat gardens under
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_17]: And more kind of a sea of green type.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's all sea of green stacked and
packed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really beautiful bedroom, really
beautiful, you know, moms.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really liked the production setup in
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: The flowering room was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: The rooms were, you know, they were,
they were not bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were, listen, they're producing
beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I happened to go to Denver after it
and saw some old friends down there and
[SPEAKER_15]: they're really killing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Using these, you know, the old
double-ended technology, which I guess is
[SPEAKER_15]: not old, but the Kavita double-enders way
up high in the ceilings.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the size of the flowers was just no
comparison.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: So when it came on the market,
it was just like, wow, it just,
[SPEAKER_17]: those that kind of really changed the game
on its own in lighting.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like whenever they came online and
so just, you know, thinking about
[SPEAKER_17]: something I can compare, I mean,
it's cool if LED can, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_17]: I just haven't seen anything compared to
like what double-ended can do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's one day there'll be a new
lighting technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, we're always going to be
skeptic because that's what happens when
[SPEAKER_15]: you got an industry standard.
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone comes in with a new technology,
whether it's disruptive or it's just,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's just a new thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And, but, you know, and so much of it too,
you know, because I really appreciate kind
[SPEAKER_17]: of what LED can do just because the
temperature control, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: so much of, you know, I mean, 80% of so
much success, you know, in cultivation is
[SPEAKER_17]: going to be in the environment created,
you know, less than one single factor or
[SPEAKER_17]: another.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like when you go into these new,
these rooms and it's like the growers
[SPEAKER_15]: doing it one way and you got to be able
to, how can you tease apart the effect of
[SPEAKER_15]: the light versus the effect of the
cultivation environment when you can't see
[SPEAKER_15]: what the growers do it every day?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's hard for you to be able to say,
oh, this much is due to the light,
[SPEAKER_15]: this much is due to the soil, this much is
due to, you know, the environment and all
[SPEAKER_15]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, it's a, it's not an easy thing
to, to that and try to figure out if
[SPEAKER_15]: you're going to switch.
[SPEAKER_15]: So really what you got to do is take,
take some lights, set up your own
[SPEAKER_15]: experiment on a side-by-side and then,
you know, you can control the variables
[SPEAKER_15]: that you control and vary the lights and
then come to an understanding.
[SPEAKER_17]: And make slow changes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Doing side-by-sides within not just a
bunch of radical changes, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: cause then it's really hard exactly to
kind of discern which individual thing is
[SPEAKER_17]: making the huge difference.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And well, that's, you know, that's one of
the reasons I got so much love for SC is
[SPEAKER_15]: it's like, to me, it's all about the lab,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: What are the numbers coming out on the
cultivation at the end?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I don't, I don't just want to see
the grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to take the flowers to SC and have
them tested, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to, otherwise you're not getting
the data, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not really understanding what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause flat, you know, biomass is one
measure, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you're pumping out a bunch of
flower, that's not, that's not high oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not high cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got no flavor.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's not what I want.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we want, we all want the goods.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody wants the, the diddly dank,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to come on real quick on
my trip home and thank you for bringing up
[SPEAKER_05]: that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I'm right there with you,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to see some proof,
want to see some more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to make a career out of this
and I want to use the best equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to just hear about it and see the same
two pictures for the last year and a half
[SPEAKER_05]: has been kind of frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if it is a game changing
revolutionary new piece of equipment,
[SPEAKER_05]: I want access to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd want to know more about how it
works before investing the money and
[SPEAKER_05]: buying that equipment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you, I mean, you're sitting there live
on TV, showing everybody exactly what
[SPEAKER_15]: you're doing, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no magic boxes at this point in
time, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming on here because there's things
I learned from that church and there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: few things I can share and if Andrew is in
a place where he can share this stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope he will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's just been a long time to not have
that stuff shared.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think what happened really,
to be perfectly honest is that he,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, he, you know, like I,
you listen, he did all the work and I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: sure he built one of these things,
like Marcus said, and was able to run the
[SPEAKER_15]: oil, the hemp seed for oil and,
and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, he built the technology and
they went and got the patents and secured
[SPEAKER_15]: that all.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's, you know, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's, that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um, at a certain point in time,
when he, when it comes onto the market and
[SPEAKER_15]: it's time when you're asking people to
drop 50, 60, a hundred thousand dollars on
[SPEAKER_15]: a piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's okay to be able for,
for someone to be a skeptic and say,
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I want to know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to be able to look at your
technology and see that it's doing this
[SPEAKER_15]: thing that you're say it's doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's not enough for me to show up
with a couple of pounds and somebody,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, disappears.
[SPEAKER_15]: Behind the wizard's curtain and then comes
back with a, that's the analogy that comes
[SPEAKER_05]: to mind too, is that it's kind of like
this mysterious curtain.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know exactly what's taking place
behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what Andrew says is taking place.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the things he's saying about the
thermodynamic efficiency of machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it does operate in that way,
it makes sense to me as somebody with a
[SPEAKER_05]: little background in engineering,
but there's still no actual proof of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I'm very excited to see
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I read, I hope, I hope the shell
down.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it showed on as a client down in
California that that's apparently bought
[SPEAKER_15]: one of these things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last word I had was that it was in
delivery or to be delivered and in process
[SPEAKER_15]: of being set up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when that happens, then, you know,
maybe we'll be able to go and have a look
[SPEAKER_15]: at the machine and see it in action.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what are the same things
from Dr. Scaldone and equally as anxious
[SPEAKER_05]: as you are to see it turned on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're all anxious to see,
I mean, everybody wants to see the new
[SPEAKER_15]: technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's the shit, then I'll back it a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I, again, I got, there's nothing
personal again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works and I can see it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will suggest to my company that we buy
one exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all we're trying to get forward
to have no solvent loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, I'm losing about a pound
and a half solvent for a run there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to get that down to zero would be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd save a lot of money and not having to
recover and do distillations and the time
[SPEAKER_05]: it takes to add the solvent to a machine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's efficiencies that come when
you're doing a batch process of that size,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I mean, you know, listen,
if it works, I'm, I'm going to be right
[SPEAKER_15]: there behind them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really, I've not absolutely nothing
against Indra.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it always, it just always makes
me nervous, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: When it's like a bicycle or a car or
running shoes or whatever, when someone
[SPEAKER_15]: says, just take my word for it and hand me
over a big stack.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't think that's, I don't
think that's unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway, whatever, I wish them the best
and I hope I hope he brings these machines
[SPEAKER_15]: to market and kills it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if they're as good as he says they
are, then, you know, that's a big win for
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of people, including him and
including the community.
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's get it out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people like me, it'll make a lot
of our jobs even easier.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's, listen, again,
I really, it's one of the things I really
[SPEAKER_15]: like about Indra and his machine is that
he's thought about all these safety
[SPEAKER_15]: issues, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, right back to when he first
came on the show and he was talking about
[SPEAKER_15]: the rooms with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_15]: And everybody working in the, with the
separate oxygen supply.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I thought that nitrogen
thing in the room was a little bit of
[SPEAKER_15]: brilliance, like to stop the, you know,
to displace the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that if you have a, if you have a fault
in the system, that you're not going to
[SPEAKER_15]: have a catastrophic failure.
[SPEAKER_15]: And same with his tuning fork,
his tuning fork switch.
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I thought that was a really
beautiful solution to a, to a complicated
[SPEAKER_15]: problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, let's not make it like,
I'm cutting down Indra or trying to be
[SPEAKER_15]: aggressive with him.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not, I'm just, you know, I think that
we need, we all need to move into a world
[SPEAKER_15]: where when you're, when you're putting up
claims and let's be honest, these claims
[SPEAKER_15]: have health implications for implications
on people's health, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: With residual solvents and, you know,
all the chemistry that's going on inside
[SPEAKER_15]: the process.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I was saying, Michelle Sexton just
released a paper on, on CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_15]: And how, you know, as Mark Sheldon has
been saying for a long time that there's
[SPEAKER_15]: chemistry that happens with cannabinoids
and terpenes and they undergo changes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that the, the, the profiles that come
out of the concentrates are different than
[SPEAKER_15]: the profiles of the flower.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when people are taking this stuff
and throwing it on a nail or inhaling it
[SPEAKER_15]: into their lungs, I mean, it's,
it's, it's only right that we ask those
[SPEAKER_15]: questions and we be, we're able to see the
results.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, through services like SC labs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's what this community has
become, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's, we're, we're, you know,
as D'Angelo says, we're out of the shadows
[SPEAKER_15]: and into the light.
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes we're under the,
the microscope light, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and on, on that kind of note
too, just with, you know, in reference to
[SPEAKER_17]: like Michelle Sexton's paper, you know,
it's, it's really fascinating because I
[SPEAKER_17]: mean, at this point I kind of wish like
Mark Sheldon was on, cause I'm sure he has
[SPEAKER_17]: some pretty good information on this,
but you know, a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: we, we see more and more, you know,
people are testing distillates,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, and these clear concentrates and
so often, you know, we'll see somebody
[SPEAKER_17]: send them in.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this goes back to like the very
beginning first kind of clear type,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, kind of post-processed extracts
that we tested back in the day with like
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Gold, you know, if anybody remembers
that product, you know, kind of a,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, these, these clear extracts,
you know, oftentimes that are like super
[SPEAKER_17]: refined.
[SPEAKER_17]: That can test up to, you know,
high, you know, mid to high nineties and
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of decarboxylated Delta nine THC.
[SPEAKER_17]: And those, you know, there's very little
to no terpenes left because of the heat
[SPEAKER_17]: processing, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, but very often times, you know,
with I mean, tremendously often we see
[SPEAKER_17]: people sending in distillates that have
basically a lot of the Delta nine degraded
[SPEAKER_17]: into Delta eight THC.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it'll kind of go into,
you know, there'll be significant amounts
[SPEAKER_17]: of CBN but very often times too,
you know, it'll be, you know, the total
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of, of the cannabinoids we're
quantifying, you know, which include Delta
[SPEAKER_17]: eight, you know, there'll be like 30,
40% total cannabinoids, but then there'll
[SPEAKER_17]: be on a chromatogram, all kinds of these,
you know, peaks in all these places that
[SPEAKER_17]: aren't kind of cannabinoids we're testing
for.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're kind of like breakdown
products, isomers.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's all these things happening
whenever people are using, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of, you know, high heat in their
distillation products.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we notice kind of these kind of,
you know, and, and so then, so then we get
[SPEAKER_17]: a lot of shit from people.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like, this is impossible.
[SPEAKER_17]: It tests 20 to 40% cannabinoids and you
guys are clearly fucked up, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: but it's like, there's way too high of a
statistical kind of reality of what we see
[SPEAKER_17]: in the data for it to be, you know,
I mean, we're, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, it's, it's, it's clear in the
chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I mean, we're not quantifying
these other compounds.
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't even necessarily know what these
other compounds are, but they're there and
[SPEAKER_17]: they're being created as a byproduct of a
lot of high heat post-processing,
[SPEAKER_17]: all these kind of, you know, post
processes that are, you know, steps that
[SPEAKER_17]: are being done to kind of either filter,
you know, attempts to filter out
[SPEAKER_17]: pesticides or to kind of further clean up
and, you know, and make the product more
[SPEAKER_17]: clear.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, but one thing we know for sure is
like, there's the, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, in, in complete and continued
retesting, and retesting of these
[SPEAKER_17]: products, it's like, you know,
the data stands, you know, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, a lot of the, a lot of the total
potential Delta 9 THC that could be
[SPEAKER_17]: distilled in the process end up kind of
creating these other byproducts.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what those byproducts are,
what the medical efficacy of those
[SPEAKER_17]: products are, you know, is unknown,
but you know, I'm very curious about it
[SPEAKER_17]: because it's one of the most kind of
controversial topics that we see kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: in those that we serve, you know,
that, you know, cause more and more people
[SPEAKER_17]: are getting, you know, sometimes,
you know, they're getting into thin film
[SPEAKER_17]: or molecular distillation or white film
distillation.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they don't, a lot of people have
a lot of substantial science kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: background that are, you know,
applying these, these tools to make
[SPEAKER_17]: distilling concentrates, but a lot of them
don't.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and it's fascinating because stoner
ingenuity and, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: it is very often kind of stumbling into
kind of, you know, creating these very
[SPEAKER_17]: interesting compounds.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, for a really long time,
Delta 8 was, you know, considered not to
[SPEAKER_17]: have medicinal benefits, but, you know,
more and more is showing that there are
[SPEAKER_17]: all kinds of different medicinal benefits.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's like, well, what are these
other isomer products being created?
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, are there benefit to them
or, you know, is there some potential
[SPEAKER_17]: detriment to them?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think a lot of that's unknown.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's totally unknown.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, you know, I think they got to,
you know, we got to keep in the context
[SPEAKER_15]: too, is that they're paying you guys a set
fee for one task, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you've got a margin built into
that fee, which is normal for any
[SPEAKER_15]: business.
[SPEAKER_15]: But that doesn't mean that you have to go,
that you're expected to go in and identify
[SPEAKER_15]: every single molecule that's in their
mixture.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's a series of different
tasks, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And that cost should be borne by the
producer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And especially when it's a producer that's
putting something on the market for a
[SPEAKER_15]: commercial purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: You got to know what's in your product,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't, especially when you're doing
all this chemistry, you have to know
[SPEAKER_15]: what's in the final product that you're
putting out into people's hands.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's really missing in our
community a lot because everybody's used
[SPEAKER_15]: to this situation where you grow it,
you extract it, you sell it, you go on
[SPEAKER_15]: vacation, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And you don't have to, people aren't used
to being held accountable like every other
[SPEAKER_15]: business in the world is, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like you have to be.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's a good point too,
because like now that, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: transparency and accountability is kind of
being demanded by the marketplace and
[SPEAKER_17]: being somewhat forced by regulation.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's really kind of,
it's now one of those things is like what
[SPEAKER_17]: you pay attention to, you become conscious
of.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you know, for the last decade,
you know, a lot of really well intentioned
[SPEAKER_17]: extract artists and people making extract
have in so many ways been peddling
[SPEAKER_17]: pesticides and tons of contaminants in
their extracts because they're running
[SPEAKER_17]: these closed loop processes.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just running, you know,
material from any farmer or any broker,
[SPEAKER_17]: bringing them any material, you know,
and it's like, you know, one dude's bad
[SPEAKER_17]: habits or, you know, choices and like,
you know, justifying and spraying systemic
[SPEAKER_17]: pesticides and the fungicides,
you know, then getting in the extraction
[SPEAKER_17]: process, then stay in the process.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then without your knowledge,
you're kind of putting out this fuego to
[SPEAKER_17]: the market, you know, kind of justifying
these super high prices and getting them.
[SPEAKER_17]: But now I think that, you know,
people are demanding testing and people
[SPEAKER_17]: are demanding transparency and
accountability.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really, it's really putting it on
people's minds where it's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: now that you know, what are you going to
do about it?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's like, you know,
you have to kind of evolve your process,
[SPEAKER_17]: but you have to kind of, you know,
do the due diligence to, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: ensure that what you are putting on the
market is in fact, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: free and clear of a lot of these kind of
harmful, you know, pesticide
[SPEAKER_17]: considerations.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, also kind of, you know,
and I don't necessarily know what the
[SPEAKER_17]: answer is to the Delta A or the
distillation kind of isomerization type
[SPEAKER_17]: realities of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you know, I mean, yeah,
we're not set up, you know, like we're set
[SPEAKER_17]: up as a, you know, a throughput analytical
testing lab with the services that we
[SPEAKER_17]: offer testing for the certain compounds
we're testing for.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, are we missing compounds?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there, there are tons of more
terpenes that we could be testing for.
[SPEAKER_17]: There are, you know, like, you know,
a lot of people are like, why aren't you
[SPEAKER_17]: guys testing for these alcohol esters and
flavonoids, you know, or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: how can you tell us more about these,
these, you know, random peaks that are
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of being created as a byproduct of,
you know, heat process distillation or
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of shifts in pH, you know,
and it's like, well, I mean, we're not
[SPEAKER_17]: dying.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, that's not, I mean, it sounded
like a 10 years ago when people were like,
[SPEAKER_12]: all right, so you got THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: So where's your pesticide testing?
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, as we know, it's a
step-by-step process.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and what I've dealt with,
you know, decade of frustration of,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, being a pioneer in testing,
it's been nothing but a challenge.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the repeated reality is, you know,
people were like, okay, well, okay,
[SPEAKER_12]: well now you've got this many pesticides.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, do you have the full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you got 39.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so do you have all of them now?
[SPEAKER_12]: So no, no one is ever going to be
satisfied.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the great thing about where we are
in this, this snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's past us, you know, we all wanted to
see cannabis grow up and be legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now everybody's bitching and
complaining about what's going on now that
[SPEAKER_12]: we're here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now it's being taxed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I remember people sitting around
saying, as long as you're taxed,
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care what happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now that it's being taxed,
it's going to be taxed and people are
[SPEAKER_12]: reaping the benefits from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And on top of that, you have to have
testing because we have to be considered
[SPEAKER_12]: like any other product on the market.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am so thankful nowadays that I will not
be the only one bearing that burden
[SPEAKER_12]: anymore that the entire state will.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that not only will they be testing for
the THC, CBD, et cetera, they're also
[SPEAKER_12]: going to be testing for all the pesticides
and stuff like that, which I've watched,
[SPEAKER_12]: countless of vendors go all around me and
sell to my competition because they don't
[SPEAKER_12]: actually test as hard or as strict as we
do.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can't go out there and yell and
scream.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only sit back and literally watch in
frustration as I watch the market have to
[SPEAKER_12]: absorb that type of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, and it's going to have to
absorb the cost of that in California now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and honestly, it'll go out of
state.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the reality.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll go out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll go elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, remember these studies have stated
that a third of grows are going to stay
[SPEAKER_12]: illegal regardless of legality and
whatever legal markets.
[SPEAKER_12]: So a third, think of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's significant.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a significant drop per se.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be, but there will be a lot
of people who are going to be reaping the
[SPEAKER_12]: benefits by doing it right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I just say one more thing too,
Alec?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you're talking about these
transformations, these chemical
[SPEAKER_15]: alterations that are going on in the
molecules.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think there is a little bit of
finger.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are people finger pointing at the
lab and say, well, you didn't do this.
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't do this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like, listen, chemistry analytics
has cost money, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like there has to be some personal
responsibility on the, on the,
[SPEAKER_15]: on the behalf of the producers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And whether that's manufacturers or
equipment or manufacturers of flowers,
[SPEAKER_15]: that it's like, it's your product,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like you're the one that has to ensure
that your stuff is safe, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't get to just stand back and point
at the lab and say, well, they made a peak
[SPEAKER_15]: that they can't, they can't identify.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, yeah, they identify that
there's a peak for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the beginning of a road to a
journey of knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when you get like, that's how science
works.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, you don't get every answer you
get, you get a series of answers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you also get a series of questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the next step is taking those
questions and following up on them.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, it's part of the maturation of
the industry, you know, and it's actually,
[SPEAKER_15]: when we talk regulations and I know you
were saying it's up to the market to
[SPEAKER_15]: determine that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a very, how do I say this about
being politically incorrect?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very American way of looking at
things because it's so, it is such a free
[SPEAKER_15]: market driven society where, you know,
this is one thing we got now in Canada
[SPEAKER_15]: with these regulations and everybody says
are so harsh and so hard to get through
[SPEAKER_15]: and expensive and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually really proud of our
regulations.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm proud that people are having to
step up their game and there's a set of
[SPEAKER_15]: rules that like essentially someone's come
in and the government's come in and set a
[SPEAKER_15]: bar.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can argue whether the bar is set at
the right level, but essentially it says,
[SPEAKER_15]: no, if you're going to do this,
you have to bring it up to this level.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the bar is set high.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone that's ever been in like one of the
well-built Canadian licensed production
[SPEAKER_11]: facilities, you can't help but go,
wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they're doing it right, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: And even the stuff that's not as good as
it could be, I mean, every iteration gets
[SPEAKER_15]: better, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, it's like we were saying before
about the science.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like you get answers to a bunch of
stuff and then you get questions about a
[SPEAKER_15]: bunch of stuff and you figure those
questions out and you give answers to them
[SPEAKER_15]: too, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, it's part of our evolution as
an industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the science is starting to show.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's all the science that's
coming out of these grows and chemical
[SPEAKER_15]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was at the ICRS this year and you know,
there was a, someone presented the poster
[SPEAKER_15]: and she showed that they were going
forward.
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, like Sheldon has been saying with
the turps, that also with the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_15]: are going through these transformations,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: There's chemistry going on in the process
and they're creating things like CESPA CBG
[SPEAKER_15]: from CBG, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Some stuff's going down, some stuff's
going up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, we have to do these tests.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's better to do these tests than it is
to just like, you know, cross our fingers
[SPEAKER_15]: and kind of blindly jump off the cliff,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like you can't, you can't,
it's not okay to just be taking products
[SPEAKER_15]: and making extracts and doing chemistry
and then putting those products on the
[SPEAKER_15]: market into other people's hands when you
don't even know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't know what the safety profiles of
things are in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like that's, to me, that's not okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and, you know, and for, for so long,
you know, ignorance is bliss has been able
[SPEAKER_17]: to kind of be a scapegoat to, you know,
do whatever it takes, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and, and, you know, in so many ways,
thanks to, you know, pioneering groups
[SPEAKER_17]: like ETN, BPG and so many of the clients
that we work with, you know, people have
[SPEAKER_17]: taken such personal expense on whenever it
wasn't required to show and prove where
[SPEAKER_17]: they're at to substantiate quality and to,
you know, at the, at the utmost level,
[SPEAKER_17]: look out for patient consumer safety,
you know, and, and, you know, whenever it
[SPEAKER_17]: wasn't cool and it was, it was just an
added expense that's going to take away
[SPEAKER_17]: from your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, people that shouldn't even
necessarily have the burden to do the
[SPEAKER_17]: testing, like a dispensary have been the
ones that are doing it actively to,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, try to on their own,
you know, microcosm level be able to,
[SPEAKER_17]: yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was hella expensive out the get go.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to do, like I said, I did 1500 tests
with the laboratory that isn't even doing
[SPEAKER_12]: this anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know what it's like to throw hundreds
of thousands of dollars, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: at something that we hope to become
science and it became science and become
[SPEAKER_12]: replicated science that is now we can all
benefit from.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I mean, you had to, I mean,
if you're, if we were giving this stuff to
[SPEAKER_12]: patients, we had to make sure that we
weren't killing them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we wanted to make sure we were doing
microbials early on as well, because I had
[SPEAKER_12]: gotten a, and Debbie, my business partner,
she had gotten a respiratory infection
[SPEAKER_12]: from a cannabis that we bought,
that we had looked through all our
[SPEAKER_12]: microscopes and everything in our
organoleptic testing showed us it was
[SPEAKER_12]: clear and good to go, but it failed along
the way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we both got sick from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We both lost days of work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And from that frustration of, you know,
losing both people who were running the
[SPEAKER_12]: company, it was, it's not an easy thing to
do as we all know, as we all run our
[SPEAKER_12]: companies, you know, when you lose major
players that can really set things back
[SPEAKER_12]: and be very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_12]: So out of that, it led to just the idea we
need to know what's going and growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it's to work into THC testing and
getting the actual percentages of THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that started off to be an initial
cluster about because we didn't release
[SPEAKER_12]: the data.
[SPEAKER_12]: Other people had released the data and
then it caused a huge ripple amongst
[SPEAKER_12]: consumers as well as amongst growers,
because people didn't understand what
[SPEAKER_12]: these numbers meant.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we knew that the THC numbers rectified
somewhere with the CBD and the other
[SPEAKER_12]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for some reason, everybody was looking
at the THC numbers all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_12]: like it was ever clear in alcohol,
high alcohol, that, you know, you've got
[SPEAKER_12]: the, you know, that you've got your beer
and then you go straight into your 90
[SPEAKER_12]: proof, your 110 or up to your 190,
you know, and people, everybody all of a
[SPEAKER_12]: sudden wanted to vie for the higher
numbers.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was an immediate quasi conundrum for
a lot of us because we wanted the data out
[SPEAKER_12]: there.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we weren't properly conveying
what this data was to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the consumer was just running with
it like it did for any other type of
[SPEAKER_12]: consumer product that, oh, the higher
number must be better.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we know, that's not necessarily the
case.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's, that's a bit of the,
we all fell and were susceptible to that
[SPEAKER_17]: early on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, and that's a bit of the disservice.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the labs as a whole have
brought to the industry is, I mean,
[SPEAKER_17]: and, and, and I mean, exactly like you
spelled out, there's been this evolving
[SPEAKER_17]: process, you know, when there wasn't a
demand for testing, there started to be
[SPEAKER_17]: this slow kind of demand because people
like yourself were kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: instituting into your process,
you know, and, and, and so slowly over
[SPEAKER_17]: time, the, the demand for the different
array of tests kind of has expanded.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then regulations is slowly defined
things, you know, but, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: up to this point, kind of, you know,
yeah, you know, before terpene testing,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, and before the labs were all
doing terpene testing it in a bit of a
[SPEAKER_17]: way, kind of, you know, the, you know,
just testing for cannabinoids and THC
[SPEAKER_17]: being the one analyte people are focusing
on it really kind of almost misinformed
[SPEAKER_17]: and conditioned so much of the marketplace
in this really wrong way, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: an almost somewhat dangerous way for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause then, you know, you have like,
you know, bud tenders that, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: are young, don't necessarily know any
better that are kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: like using kind of THC as a metric for
quality testing, THC strains to new time
[SPEAKER_17]: vets and old patients with post-traumatic
stress or cancer that have never used
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and so, you know, I mean,
in so many ways, it's just been this
[SPEAKER_17]: continuing evolution, evolutionary process
of kind of demanding more from the labs,
[SPEAKER_17]: demanding more from those that are making
the products, but, you know, being,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, taking on the expense before,
you know, it was a thing, I think is,
[SPEAKER_17]: is definitely like repeatedly worth
mentioning because, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_17]: it was, you know, I mean, paying 7,200
back in the day for pounds of herb,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, and then like doing testing on
top of that, just so that you can show
[SPEAKER_17]: these things, you know, kind of was just
an added expense when most people weren't
[SPEAKER_17]: taking it, you know, now that kind of,
that's shifting and, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: the, the marketplace is demanding kind of
transparency.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's really, like, you know,
the market is also going to be demanding
[SPEAKER_12]: that you accept as the farmer,
you accept that as a responsibility of
[SPEAKER_12]: your growing is also accepting
responsibility of that testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, that's, that's a shared
burden by all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I'm going to pay more for that in
the end because of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how it's done, but that's just
how the marketplace is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, and, and, but then
rightfully so kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: the, the, the testing and the burden of
proof is on the people making the
[SPEAKER_17]: products.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: About, you know, the regulated kind of
market because, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's helping to essentially, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if, if you're growing products and
you're trying to get them out in the
[SPEAKER_17]: market, so you have to kind of prove in a
bit of a way, you know, what, what's up,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, and, and, you know, ignorance is
bliss is no longer a thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and ignorance is, if anything,
you're going to get you quickly catapulted
[SPEAKER_17]: out of the industry, you know,
the, the landmine field in front of us,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, of pesticides and, you know,
kind of all these aspects of like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, sloppy production or,
you know, not conscious, understanding of
[SPEAKER_17]: supply chain management and where,
you know, you can introduce these certain
[SPEAKER_17]: contaminants into your process.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, those things are the things that
are going to get you ejected real quick,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think, I think those that have
been working through these, the,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the minefields for, you know,
up to this point and have, have done
[SPEAKER_17]: testing to, you know, kind of learn the
lessons and to, to learn the hard lessons
[SPEAKER_17]: oftentimes equate to having to destroy
product, you know, you know, are kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: the things that now are going to make you
most succeed in the coming, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: in the coming years, you know,
because a lot of people that are new and
[SPEAKER_17]: just coming in, you know, with really high
projections about how much money they're
[SPEAKER_17]: going to make, you know, they have such a
like body of knowledge that they have yet
[SPEAKER_17]: to acquire or have yet to fall in their
face to learn.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, I think, I think it's,
it's really going to serve those that,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, took the initiative to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, again, big ups.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And speaking of just want to give a shout
out to Berkeley patients group,
[SPEAKER_12]: because next week we turn 18.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're old enough to vote.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't hear you bubble man for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, congratulations, but also that
bubble bags is turning 18 in March.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just a couple more months, three,
four more months.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's quite a milestone at Jen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, Mark, when you get there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, happy birthday to you both.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to many people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who made that possible in a long,
strong fight against five year fight
[SPEAKER_12]: against government to make it a reality.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I also, I think I met Debbie around 18
years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here in BC, like at my house in lions Bay,
like a couple of doors over from where I
[SPEAKER_11]: am right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, yeah, they went and they visited,
um, you know, Hillary and then they,
[SPEAKER_12]: they wanted to see what was going on there
and look to, you know, what you guys were
[SPEAKER_12]: doing to also reflect, you know,
the compassion and understanding.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was going on there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was an international effort after
seeing things that went on in the
[SPEAKER_12]: Netherlands and thing things unionizing
like the Dutch did where we all were
[SPEAKER_12]: together in Oakstradam and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been a long, uh, it's been a
long, amazing trip and it's been,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, it's been a fun ride just to needless
to say, cause, uh, Oakstam is also coming
[SPEAKER_12]: up on it's, uh, it's birthday too.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, yeah, big ups there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause that was a major spread that
started, you know, that was our,
[SPEAKER_12]: our failed initiative, uh, here in
California that led to the successes in
[SPEAKER_12]: Oregon and Washington and Colorado and
other States.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once we failed, we showed it was possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: So everybody else decided, well,
what we can do it too.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, Colorado became the first,
God bless them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, now we're going to see what
happens in 2018.
[SPEAKER_12]: There should be more.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we anticipate hopefully, uh,
you know, more States are coming online
[SPEAKER_12]: here real soon, which will, you know,
just like the medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_12]: we started off with one now it's over 28.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're over 50% now in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_12]: We just have to push it a little further.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, here very soon with, with
legalized cannabis, you know, New York
[SPEAKER_12]: States, very jealous of DC.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, the Florida isn't,
you know, happy with just its medical.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's gonna be interesting to see what
happens here in 2018 and 2020.
[SPEAKER_11]: What year would that have been that they
came out here to Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe they went on a spring tour or
something like that with a group,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, that just, uh, Debbie, of course we
had the cannabis action network and such
[SPEAKER_12]: back then.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was my original way to Canada
back in 93, um, doing a rally there in
[SPEAKER_12]: Vancouver, but we got kicked out because
of LV's medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we were never allowed to actually do
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, uh, that was, uh, yeah, just part of
the process.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's, uh, it's been a ride and we
still got a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see by just our discussion of
science and everything else.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're just getting online here
with regulations here in California and,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, with machinery and technology
and all that it's, uh, it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, I've only seen a small blip of
it, but it all goes back to that man
[SPEAKER_12]: sitting there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little plush sitting there in a
seat there by the name of Skunk Van Sam
[SPEAKER_12]: that made a lot of what we have today
possible through genetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: So big ups to you, sir.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's never forgotten.
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was happy to do it at the time in my
life.
[SPEAKER_11]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_17]: I bet you were happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sam, what's up with the CBG varieties?
[SPEAKER_17]: You got any of those?
[SPEAKER_13]: We developed an almost pure CBG variety,
correct?
[SPEAKER_17]: And is, is that, is that, is, is the,
is the pathway towards a CBG?
[SPEAKER_17]: Dominant varietal kind of because of some
type of genetic, you know, mutation or
[SPEAKER_17]: something in the synthase genes,
or is that just a natural process that
[SPEAKER_17]: strains can go through?
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause oftentimes we'll test it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a particular group of synthases.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can read the paper.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, if you don't have it, uh, send me an
email and I'll send it to you or contact
[SPEAKER_13]: me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's, it's, I think it's actually a
little more complicated.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the paper suggests you've done some
work in that area.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good place to start understanding
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's essentially what it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's, um, we, you know, we got,
we got versions of CBD acid synthase and
[SPEAKER_15]: THC acid synthase.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's, there's versions on both that
don't work or they call them minimally
[SPEAKER_15]: functional.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, as anybody that knows the
biochemistry, CBG acid is the precursor to
[SPEAKER_15]: both CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you have broken machine,
machinery that turns up, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: that turns CBG acid into THC or CBG acid
into CBD, and those enzymes aren't working
[SPEAKER_15]: properly, then what happens is you have a
backup of CBG.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause you know, cause they're like,
we don't, I mean, most of the samples
[SPEAKER_17]: we've ever tested, you know, CBG,
a we'll see, you know, maybe two and a
[SPEAKER_17]: half, 3% most in certain varietals,
you know, actually 3% is quite high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, ours was only maybe triple that or a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause yeah, I mean, but typically every
time we ever see that it'll either be in a
[SPEAKER_17]: turpinoline osamine variety of THC
dominant turpinoline osamine variety,
[SPEAKER_17]: um, with maybe two and a half percent
CBGA, or it'll be a myrcine osamine THC
[SPEAKER_17]: variety where same thing, it'll be mostly
THCA, but then two and a half,
[SPEAKER_17]: 3% CBGA.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, just, I mean,
having no idea what's up there,
[SPEAKER_17]: just seeing kind of the common thing
across those as, you know, does that mean
[SPEAKER_13]: anything to you, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this, I mean, not the turpinoline
one, but I think I know where those are
[SPEAKER_15]: coming from, but, um, the CBG acid in the
myrcine osamine profile, I'm assuming that
[SPEAKER_15]: you're seeing about myrcine two to one
over osamine.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or more, you know, typically it'll be,
you know, primary myrcine, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_17]: then two to one or three to one kind of
myrcine osamine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that myrcine osamine smell is what I
call sweet hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's very, a very pleasant
smell myself.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a lot of people are calling like
mangoes or papayas or green crack dream
[SPEAKER_17]: queen, you know, kind of all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: What we've seen, um, you know,
are in that kind of group, but,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, we very rarely see osamine or
osamine as a primary terpene, but whenever
[SPEAKER_17]: it shows up as, you know, kind of a
secondary terpene, it seems to be either
[SPEAKER_17]: tracking with the myrcine grouping or with
the turpinoline grouping on the other side
[SPEAKER_17]: of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really see it kind of with other,
or I think there's a, there's a myrcine
[SPEAKER_15]: synthase that produces both myrcine and
osamine and about a two to one,
[SPEAKER_15]: three to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it varies between alleles of that,
of that particular type.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it is interesting though, cause we've
seen, uh, you know, kind of a couple
[SPEAKER_17]: different, you know, like in the pines in
the pines has been this awesome,
[SPEAKER_17]: yeah, pineapple too, but you know,
the tropical fruit smell.
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess like, uh, my mango papaya
pineapple oftentimes will be really high
[SPEAKER_17]: myrcine and then a little bit of osamine.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but, but, you know, we, we have seen
from a couple different groups that
[SPEAKER_17]: sprouted a bunch of like in the pine
seeds, which is, you know, this pretty
[SPEAKER_17]: awesome pineapple type smell from up in
Mendo, the Emerald triangle that has been,
[SPEAKER_17]: um, you know, historically kind of in the
top 10 that the Emerald cup, uh,
[SPEAKER_17]: for many years, but, but when they,
when people sprouted some seeds,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, we started to see, you know,
a couple of those phenos be either one to
[SPEAKER_17]: one, like balance of myrcine and osamine
or in certain, certain cases, we've seen a
[SPEAKER_17]: couple of these that are often dominant.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but those are, those are all in type
one plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was trying to go back to what you
were talking about with the type four
[SPEAKER_15]: plants, which are the CBG plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you, if you go back and you look at
those and you see that myrcine and
[SPEAKER_15]: osamine, usually like Sam was saying,
the total cannabinoid level is actually
[SPEAKER_15]: quite low.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in, in most of the CBG varieties,
not all of them, but most of the ones that
[SPEAKER_15]: you see on the market, they were derived
from hemp populations.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: So your, your total cannabinoid volume
switch is actually turned down quite low.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so in, in the process of turning that
up by hybridizing it with drug cultivars
[SPEAKER_15]: over and over again, and then selecting
for the CBG mutation, you start to change
[SPEAKER_15]: the terpene profile away from that,
like hempy sweet kind of hempy smell into
[SPEAKER_15]: something a little more dank.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are varieties now.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just in Spain about three weeks ago,
visiting with a good friend of mine over
[SPEAKER_15]: there.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a license.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the only license in Spain's
produced THC plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, I went down on their,
their research facility in, uh,
[SPEAKER_15]: in, in the Southwestern Spain,
but actually with Dr. Riz.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, we saw a whole bunch of different
CBG varieties and CBD, CBDV varieties and
[SPEAKER_15]: some CBD varieties they're working on with
a molecular molecule called canoprene.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so there are people that are breeding
those lines up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's not very dank CBG stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things about CBG, when you see
these CBG plants, the trichomes are white.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not sticky and they're kind of dry
feeling kind of like grainy, sandy feeling
[SPEAKER_15]: when the trichomes are white.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's because the CBG, it doesn't
dissolve into the oleo resin, like CBD or
[SPEAKER_15]: THC acid would.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so they actually have a different
texture on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not oily.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not sticky.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's, there's nothing fun about it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, there's, I mean, what's,
what's really fascinating to me about the
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of CBG and stuff is, um, there's
this, there's this paper I oftentimes
[SPEAKER_17]: reference about, um, the anti,
anti inflammation effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, um, I'll find the paper and post
it up, but it's about the potential cycle
[SPEAKER_17]: oxygenase inhibition of six primary
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and it basically, you know,
there's this chart that all kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, I'll throw up on the chat,
but it's, uh, it shows, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: the percent inhibition of Cox one and Cox
two COX one COX two, which are the enzymes
[SPEAKER_17]: in our body responsible for producing
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cox two, just so people can get the idea
or some kind of context on Cox two,
[SPEAKER_15]: um, ibuprofen as a Cox two inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, and, and, you know, and,
and, and, and it correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_17]: but from what I knew, yeah, pretty much
all the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_17]: drugs, like ibuprofen, Motrin and stuff
pretty much act on one or either or both.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that right or wrong?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not, I mean, I'm not a farmer.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can't say, but regardless,
you know, kind of, it's this, this chart
[SPEAKER_17]: shows both inhibition of Cox one and
inhibition of Cox two.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you look at the six primary
cannabinoids that this paper is talking
[SPEAKER_17]: about CBD and THC actually kind of have
almost negative inhibition.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think CBD has, you know, certain like,
you know, 25, 30% inhibition of one of the
[SPEAKER_17]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_17]: But when you look at CBG and CBGA,
you know, they both have their,
[SPEAKER_17]: their, their, their Richter kind of like
all the other cannabinoids potential to
[SPEAKER_17]: inhibit those enzymes and have almost up
to a hundred percent inhibition on those
[SPEAKER_17]: two enzymes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's really fascinating to kind of,
you know, think about and postulate,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, you know, anti-inflammation,
I guess in treating illness, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: cause most disease and disorder in one way
or another is rooted in some type of
[SPEAKER_17]: systemic inflammation, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, just kind of,
you know, understanding how many people
[SPEAKER_17]: across America and the world, you know,
are taking horse pills of these
[SPEAKER_17]: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, you know, longterm, how much
those drugs do damage, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: to your kidneys and liver and such.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, yeah, well, you know,
there's also some of these other ones say
[SPEAKER_15]: it's a bunch of years ago and it wasn't
that long ago, maybe five, eight years
[SPEAKER_15]: ago, but they started realizing that some
of these cox two inhibitor drugs,
[SPEAKER_15]: these NSAIDs, they're giving people heart
attacks, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like they were, they were on the market
and then they realized that like a whole
[SPEAKER_15]: bunch of people that had way higher
incidence of heart problems.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and so it's like for these
non-psychoactive kind of CBG components of
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis to be able to completely,
you know, knock that out and inhibit those
[SPEAKER_17]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like that's so much way.
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems like the path forward to creating
like the miracle anti-inflammation drugs
[SPEAKER_17]: of the future, but it's like where do
those where do those compounds,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: Then here's the next question.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, are we going to be smoking those
things?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they going to become, you know,
are they going to become formulations in
[SPEAKER_15]: other, in other products, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's, it's, it's part of that
transition that the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_15]: industry is going to go through is that at
some point in time, a lot of these things
[SPEAKER_15]: are going to be, it's going to listen,
it's going to be like Epidiolex,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like somebody is going to take CBG and
they're going to put it through the FDA
[SPEAKER_15]: process.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the FDA is going to start sending
out a bunch of letters to everybody that's
[SPEAKER_15]: making those CBGA or CBG products on the
market, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we've already been through this once.
[SPEAKER_15]: This whole thing is going to happen over
and over again with every one of these
[SPEAKER_15]: compounds, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's rinse, lather, repeat pretty much.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is rich rather than it's like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is what happens when we bring
cannabis into the real world, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we're going to start trying to
exploit these compounds for fun.
[SPEAKER_15]: We, we start entering a world that's,
you know, it's a different world than the
[SPEAKER_15]: dispensary world, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we should, I think with good
reason, you know, I think we should be
[SPEAKER_15]: wary of people saying, Oh, I've got this,
you know, green crack variety,
[SPEAKER_15]: variety, for example, with 2% CBGA.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, 2% CBGA by weight of a gram.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, really like, is that the way that
you're going to be taking that is smoking
[SPEAKER_15]: up a joint of like a 2% CBGA variety?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then whenever you burn it,
it combusts like half to more of what's
[SPEAKER_17]: there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like the potential 20 or less.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something that's really been
helping me of speaking to inflammation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been dealing with some inflammatory
pain and like repetitive motion injuries
[SPEAKER_05]: just from my job there and carpal tunnel
issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Washington state, our dispensaries
got taken away from us and our medical
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana program was decimated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now pills like this that contain high
amounts of CBG without any THC in them are
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal in Washington state and I can't
purchase these.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to go back to the black market
to obtain medicines that actually provide
[SPEAKER_05]: like ambinoid therapy for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's the source of that CBG in those
pills then?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a super good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an answer to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a verified lab report to know
the details of what it is because our
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace has taken those products off
the shelves.
[SPEAKER_15]: So have you had those pills analyzed?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only got 10 of them to try out and I
didn't have the money to go send them to a
[SPEAKER_05]: lab.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's, I mean, that's the,
again, it's the routine.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the system, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time we want to know what's in our
medicine, we got to go and pay for a lab
[SPEAKER_15]: test.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we could have a marketplace that
allows cannabinoid medicines to be
[SPEAKER_05]: produced in 502 and then go to the same
testing labs that we send all our other
[SPEAKER_05]: products to and put on the shelf for
people to use as medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for whatever reason, Washington state
decided that products that are sold in our
[SPEAKER_05]: retail stores have to contain THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that knocked out a really big
variety of actual medicines that really
[SPEAKER_05]: helped a lot of people like me and
patients I used to make medicines for and
[SPEAKER_05]: work with back in the med days here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, don't get me wrong again.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not trying to come off standing all
firm or that where everything's got to be
[SPEAKER_15]: FDA approved, but what I'm not okay with
is people putting products on the market
[SPEAKER_15]: that say they are CBG and then they're
not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm going to spend my money on a CBG
product to help me, I want it to actually
[SPEAKER_13]: help.
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's extracted from a plant source
and it's CBG, I bet you anything there's
[SPEAKER_13]: some THC A or THC in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was told that each of these pills has
110 milligrams of CBG, 35 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_05]: THC A and about 10 milligrams of THC B and
it was created from an old Toby varietal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Might be right on for all I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have no reason to doubt it,
but I also don't have any reason to trust
[SPEAKER_05]: it because I don't have a lab report for
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like, you can work on a stuck in a
tough situation where when you don't have
[SPEAKER_15]: anything or any reason to doubt it,
but that doesn't mean that you also have
[SPEAKER_15]: any reason to believe it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we're still stuck in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got my own bioassay where I was not
able to get a night's sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd wake up at three, four, I am in my
arms would be either asleep or burning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now after a week of taking these
pills, I sleep all the way through the
[SPEAKER_05]: night and I wake up and my arms are on
fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then with all those compounds in it,
it'd be in a mixture.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it has probably got turps in there
too.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, how do you pinpoint what the
activity, which if it was even one
[SPEAKER_05]: specific compound or if it's the variety
of course, the synergy between all of
[SPEAKER_15]: them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we don't know that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, that's like, that's really
what we're missing in this world is the
[SPEAKER_15]: science, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: That backs all this stuff up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to work on products like this
and have them go, go to labs and get
[SPEAKER_05]: tested and know exactly what's in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, deliver those to
patients and consumers that want them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well then, you know, you find something
that works.
[SPEAKER_15]: You find someone works and all of a sudden
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pulled off the market, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, the whole situation is really
kind of silly right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's, it's, it is a very tough
question to answer because there's all
[SPEAKER_15]: these compounds in the, in the plant and,
you know, maybe not in one given plant,
[SPEAKER_15]: but in the, in the species and in the
selection of plants that we all work with,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, there's, you know, whether it be
different terpene types or different
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabinoid types, it's a massive
polyfactorial like experiment with
[SPEAKER_15]: hundreds of thousands of people at least.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're all taking different amounts
and they're all taking different things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And some people are having success and
some people aren't having success.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a really hard nut to crack from
a, it's really hard nut to crack from a
[SPEAKER_15]: research point of view to start figuring
these things out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when the people that aren't
having success don't know for sure what
[SPEAKER_05]: they're taking and whether they should be
having success with it or not.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey Alec, what do you got going on there?
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe Marcus can click your camera and we
can.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, I was, this is that chart I was
talking about, you know, from this paper,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's called evaluation of the
cyclooxygenase inhibiting effects of six
[SPEAKER_17]: major cannabinoids isolated from cannabis
sativa and, you know, the black bar is
[SPEAKER_17]: COCOX-1 and then the gray bar is COX-2.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it shows the, you know, percent
inhibition of each one of these
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and it is a trip because like,
if you look at THC and CBD, you kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: almost have those weird negative
inhibition, which I don't even really know
[SPEAKER_17]: what that means.
[SPEAKER_17]: But then whenever you look at the acidic
cannabinoids, you know, as THCA,
[SPEAKER_17]: CBDA, and then even more CBG and CBGA,
it's crazy how much CBG and CBGA have for
[SPEAKER_17]: both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's crazy how much CBG inhibiting,
you know, both of these kind of enzymes up
[SPEAKER_17]: to, you know, almost a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, look, look at the other thing that's
really interesting to me, at least on that
[SPEAKER_15]: graph is that the acidic forms,
which are the ones that are natural in the
[SPEAKER_15]: plant that you find when you don't
decarboxylate through, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: chemistry or, or you don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, those, those compounds are,
it looks like, you know, THCA,
[SPEAKER_15]: CBDA, and CBGA are more effective than any
of the other, the neutral forms.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what's such a trip,
too, because, you know, it's fascinating
[SPEAKER_17]: with, because so often, and this is a bit
aside, but I mean, kind of think it ties
[SPEAKER_17]: in a little bit to the point.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, so many times, like people
that are making infused products,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, they're taking like some type of
extract, right, from like a quote,
[SPEAKER_17]: sativa or quotes, indica strain,
right, with certain terpenes dominant in
[SPEAKER_17]: each, and they decarboxylate that oil.
[SPEAKER_17]: So pretty much they boil off any and all
the remaining terpenes that are there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what they create is like a fully
decarboxylated, you know, kind of delta 9
[SPEAKER_17]: THC extract that then they're infusing
into an edible or infused product,
[SPEAKER_17]: and they're heating further to make the
edible or infused product and,
[SPEAKER_17]: but then they're labeling these products
like, you know, an indica edible or a
[SPEAKER_17]: sativa edible, you know, and it's funny,
because I feel like there's so much,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, it's almost like suggestive
selling and, and like trying to push
[SPEAKER_17]: people's placebo effects, because,
you know, most of these products where
[SPEAKER_17]: people will take a strain, decarboxylate
oil, put it in and call it a sativa,
[SPEAKER_17]: indica, sativa or indica edible,
you know, they're kind of really what it
[SPEAKER_17]: is, it's just high THC.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, you know, so much of like why
it affects somebody one way or another
[SPEAKER_17]: more has to do with dose.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then yeah, the time of day they're
taking it, whether they're taking it on an
[SPEAKER_17]: empty stomach or a full stomach,
whether or not they have a hyperactive or
[SPEAKER_17]: underactive metabolism, whether or not
they're like sedentary and, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: playing video games all day long,
or whether or not they have a,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, an active lifestyle where
they're running all the time, because all
[SPEAKER_17]: those things are going to express your
endocannabinoid tone in one way or
[SPEAKER_17]: another.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how active or underactive it
is, but, but, but whenever you kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, but for whenever people are
taking like these, you know, acidic
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabinoids, you know, like in these high
concentrations or what have you,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, not only does it seem like it's,
you know, from this chart, it shows that,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, they're inhibiting and,
you know, these, these enzymes,
[SPEAKER_17]: but, you know, also in whenever people are
juicing or, or, you know, doing like
[SPEAKER_17]: unheated kind of extracts put into kind of
infused products so that it's all in the
[SPEAKER_17]: THC or CBA form, they're also then
actually getting whatever concentrations
[SPEAKER_17]: of terpenes are in there into the infused
product that people are then ingesting.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's, it's interesting to think
about, you know, what a true kind of,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, plant derived terpene infused
product, what that would do if it does,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, stimulate a stimulating effect
or a sedating effect, but then how much
[SPEAKER_17]: those terpenes also play a role maybe in,
you know, what's happening here with these
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of inhibition of these you know,
inflammatory enzymes, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just find it really funny though,
because a lot of people kind of will
[SPEAKER_17]: always say indicar, sativa in their
edibles, whenever it's pretty much just
[SPEAKER_17]: THC, you know, but, you know, I,
and, and, and, you know, oftentimes when
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm doing kind of a lot of education
seminars for like dispensaries and bud
[SPEAKER_17]: tenders, you know, I'm trying to kind of
really, I always show this slide because
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, you know, this is the,
you know, the acidic cannabinoids are the
[SPEAKER_17]: most, if you counted all the kind of
cumulative cannabinoids that are held in
[SPEAKER_17]: your shop, you know, it's all THCA or
CBDA, primarily THCA, but nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_17]: guiding people towards taking those,
whether it's, you know, juicing fresh bud
[SPEAKER_17]: or leaf, whether it's grinding up fresh
bud and putting it like in a smoothie or
[SPEAKER_17]: something, or, or whether that's eating
little amounts of, you know, on heat
[SPEAKER_17]: processed kind of extracts that are more
high in acidic cannabinoids, but in either
[SPEAKER_17]: way, it seems like we all could benefit so
much more from acidic cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, especially you know,
with the anti inflammation effects,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, particularly because of,
you know, how most disease and disorder,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, are rooted in systemic
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's typically because of the shit
food choices we put into our bodies and
[SPEAKER_17]: the toxic environment we live in.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, the fucking chemicals that
we expose ourselves to because,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the pesticides and fucking
glyphosate that are in everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, it seems like the acidic
cannabinoids provide a roadmap for us to
[SPEAKER_17]: help, you know, Dr. Courtney, who,
who is, he gave me my first, or I got my
[SPEAKER_17]: first recommendation from Dr. William
Courtney, who's kind of this like black
[SPEAKER_17]: sheep medical doctor, you know,
that was really like, in so many ways,
[SPEAKER_17]: like the, you know, the, I mean,
it was, it's so funny, because he would be
[SPEAKER_17]: presenting and I would see Ethan Rooster
like balking at him, like in, in crowds
[SPEAKER_17]: where he was presenting, but you know,
he was way ahead of his time, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: and he turned me on to acidic
cannabinoids, he turned me on to CBD,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, whenever I was living up in
Mendo and really sparked passion in my
[SPEAKER_17]: life about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so since then, I've just been really
pushing people to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: look at the the diverse profile of
cannabinoids that you could be taking,
[SPEAKER_17]: because most people are, you know,
popping it getting high THC is the main
[SPEAKER_17]: thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's like, we need more of these like
what he would call dietary essential
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabinoids in our life, you know,
and he believes that, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: one day, society will view the acidic
cannabinoids as much of a dietary
[SPEAKER_17]: essential as you know, we're currently
considering omega acids, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: being kind of, you know, keeping our life,
you know, in the preventative kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: state of not being too inflamed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, I mean, I'm all over what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just I want to just say one thing about
the inflammation being the genesis of all
[SPEAKER_15]: the all the disease that may or may not be
true, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's tough to say whether the inflammation
is the cause or like a byproduct of so
[SPEAKER_15]: right correlations not causing I would
definitely just be careful when you're
[SPEAKER_15]: saying that at dispensaries, because I
don't know we know that to be true yet or
[SPEAKER_15]: not.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do agree with with almost everything
you said.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, Courtney, you know,
history will be the history will be the
[SPEAKER_15]: the teller of what happens over time,
you know, whether he's a cook or a
[SPEAKER_15]: visionary and only and I know I know that
some people see him that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, he does say some kind of
kooky things at that times as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think he also has a lot of he's got
a lot of good information and he stumbled
[SPEAKER_15]: on something that I think a lot of people
probably weren't looking at, because,
[SPEAKER_15]: again, we've been so focused on on the
neutral forms of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, even in the way we used to do
everything by G.C., right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, you know, back then you'd look at a
G.C.
[SPEAKER_15]: trace and you'd say you'd think to
yourself, oh, well, we can't the plant
[SPEAKER_15]: produces T.H.C.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it doesn't produce it produces T.H
.C.
[SPEAKER_15]: acid is that the the analytical method
that they were using makes it seem that
[SPEAKER_15]: way.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, again, we got to apply the
right tests to the, you know, to be able
[SPEAKER_15]: to pull the answer, the true answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not just like throwing some
science at it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to get the answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's remember science is like anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to be validated.
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to be needs to be shown over time
by multiple sources.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not just one paper that says
something and it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a discovery that we go through over
time.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: So great info, Alec.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for sharing that, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very, very good information.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last hour of hash charts just blasting it
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Mark, I found that paper and put it
in the our little our Hangouts chat.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you can post that in the
other in the in the YouTube chat so people
[SPEAKER_15]: can find the paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't have the resources or access to
look at those things up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll post it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will post it right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Came on Alec, you always spur a really
good conversation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Glad you stopped in.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, no, I'm super appreciate,
appreciate everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: Always appreciate being on and appreciate
being checked, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, you know, it's like, do you and
yeah, Ryan, that's what's so awesome,
[SPEAKER_17]: man, is like you're you're super
indiscriminate with like science being the
[SPEAKER_17]: way forward and and the way you word
things, you know, and so so appreciate
[SPEAKER_17]: that because yeah, I mean, there's a lot
of contributing factors to why disease and
[SPEAKER_17]: disorder exists.
[SPEAKER_17]: Inflammation is part of what may or may
not be the main proponent.
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, as much as we know, we got to
remember that we really don't know
[SPEAKER_15]: anything with how the human body works and
how the brain works.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we've got a few things figured
out.
[SPEAKER_15]: But really, when we're throwing these
compounds and we're just like flipping
[SPEAKER_15]: levers and pressing buttons, you know,
oh, look, what happens here?
[SPEAKER_15]: And we don't really understand all the
mechanisms involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that's also important to
keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's like everywhere you see all
the stuff in the in the in the average
[SPEAKER_15]: media, not the scientific literature,
but it just in the media.
[SPEAKER_15]: But even, you know, cannabis kills cancer.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, well, there might be some
compounds that have certain anti cancer
[SPEAKER_15]: properties against certain types of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_15]: But to say that, you know, cannabis kills
cancer, it's just not true.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it does it does the plan to disservice
when we when we try to overgeneralize.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I find that we're like, you know,
that at that point in time, we're no
[SPEAKER_15]: better than the DEA saying that there's no
value.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the truth is somewhere in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think less like trying to reach too
far.
[SPEAKER_15]: It really does the the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: It does the truth of disservice for one.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it also does the plan to disservice
because it really can do some things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we start claiming that it can do
all these other things that it can't do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then people are going to they're not going
to believe the things that it can do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't explain that very well,
but no, no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, by overstating, you know,
and being too fanatical about what we're
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to express, you know, definitely is
food or like, you know, whatever food for
[SPEAKER_17]: fodder for like the opposition to to kind
of discredit the argument.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we have a moral response.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you know, we're going to we're
only going to get ahead through the truth.
So.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, awesome, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was a solid conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank everyone for coming in
today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chimera, for coming back and
Alec coming in from SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Jeremy, for coming in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd love to have you back again and
have some more conversation with you and
[SPEAKER_11]: find out what's going on with build the
soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Gunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, Sam, Samurai Sam for
running us through a batch and always
[SPEAKER_11]: coming in and ready for the conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for being a part of this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: A part of things, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, everyone else that has already
left.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those that never showed up this
day and of course, for the I think seven
[SPEAKER_11]: plus hundred people we had watching at one
point in time, you may very well see us
[SPEAKER_11]: back next week.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace out, everybody.
Please.
[SPEAKER_17]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy Ashturch.
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy Sunday, y'all.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
