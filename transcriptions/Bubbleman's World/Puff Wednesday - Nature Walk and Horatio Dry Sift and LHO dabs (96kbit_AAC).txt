[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here in West Vancouver, right on the
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the Lionsgate Bridge in the
background.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a ship that's coming through right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you've got West Vancouver on
this side here, and as you go over the
[SPEAKER_05]: bridge, you end up in Stanley Park,
which is that right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, of course, have my Fabeg with my
banger, which I got from DC Glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dark Crystal Glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess today what I'm going to do is
a little show on just traveling around
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver and West Vancouver and ripping
bowls.
[SPEAKER_05]: I obviously have my license, so if I go to
a private area or a public area where,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, no one's around, I'm able to do
rips without really being in breach of any
[SPEAKER_05]: laws, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I saw this deck out here and I thought,
this is where we'll start the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a couple of rips, a couple of
rips out here, and then we'll head into
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe the mountains, maybe go up to Cyprus
or maybe head over to Grouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't exactly know, but we'll see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a couple of Japanese people
coming and we'll see what they think of
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Japanese people, get ready for a dab,
because that is what is happening here
[SPEAKER_05]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I suspect they're curious as to what it is
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we better have another rip and just
let them see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're stretching right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost want to move the camera and show
you guys because it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good old West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I've got a bird as my guest here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bird is the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, bird?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a brave bird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that concludes the first part of
our session.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will catch you in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was just dumping out the water
from the fab egg and man, if this little
[SPEAKER_05]: bird didn't come check it out,
it's like he wants to take a rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to take a rip, buddy?
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There he's taking a rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just being silly, hanging out with nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: This bird's getting a little closer now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't want to hit this guy to get
whatever it is he's possibly getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought it was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I am here in the beautiful
Lighthouse Park.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trees everywhere behind me, above me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really beautiful park, Lighthouse Park in
West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to be able to come do all the trails.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of people walking their dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been looking for water and I've
literally found the smallest little
[SPEAKER_05]: trickle right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So without further ado, I guess what we're
going to do here is try and get water into
[SPEAKER_02]: the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gentle, gentle, gentle mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adding the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all rock here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to be real careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the last one, I used ocean water,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time here, last little bit,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all of you cringing out there in the
world of YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we go down or do we go up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go down first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a quick rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll head back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a really nice spot in the forest
where I wanted to share a rip with you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, looks like we found the next spot
for sessions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw how I had to put water in this
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to get those nice bubbles
because of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So without too much further ado,
let's torch up the banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the quartz because it seems to hold
its heat for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still managed to get my dab ready in a
hurry.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So get the dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course the Zeha shishi,
which is going to be an important part of
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is called multitasking here.
[SPEAKER_06]: People pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Respect to this monster tree that's bent
over next to me here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the size of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're going to head down a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just right at the Pacific ocean and
yeah, I think it's probably not a bad idea
[SPEAKER_05]: for us to wrap this up and go head out
there and have a bowl in the open ocean.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to head back up and
have a bowl in the middle of the forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to get all of our bases
covered and I think we're doing a pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think this is a good spot for us
to maybe set up the camera and have a rip
[SPEAKER_05]: or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might want to hang out at this
spot for a little bit in fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have everything we need.
[SPEAKER_06]: All we need is the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I access it without dumping the whole
lot?
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be the test.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're at one of the outer cliff faces
of lighthouse park.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great place for many people to
come.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right off the coast of Bowen Island
over here on this side behind me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, right behind me, this island
in my hand right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Hutt Island.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only gone around it once myself on a
boat, but it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I say, why don't we get right to
business here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the hash of the dabber much closer
this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speed up that nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I pooch my torch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fixed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this little guy here?
[SPEAKER_05]: See this little guy here?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was way over here and I needed to put
him over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let more oxygen through the hole there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not very good with the torch,
I will admit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting for whoever is
walking above me right now to stick their
[SPEAKER_05]: head up over the ledge and see me down
here with the fab egg and the quartz
[SPEAKER_05]: banger and the creme brulee.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could see whales, could see dolphins.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see either right now, but you
could.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the glass on quartz carb cap there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was probably the best hit I've had so
far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best one so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing to hike through the forest
on a lovely non rainy day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another completely to bring your fab
egg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we roll with our fab eggs through
the forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Climbing up rocky, super sketchy terrain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking my fab egg for a walk.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right guys, so this is going to be the
last place that we hit a bowl together
[SPEAKER_05]: while we tour Lighthouse Park together.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an easy park to find if you want
to leave Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take the Lionsgate Bridge and you go
left onto Marine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a right and it loops you
around back underneath.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you follow that into West Vancouver
and you just keep going and going and
[SPEAKER_05]: going and I mean you go for quite a ways
past the fire department and all these
[SPEAKER_05]: things before you see this little sign on
the left right by the bus stop that'll say
[SPEAKER_05]: Lighthouse Park.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you can find an address and
directions if you Google it, but there
[SPEAKER_05]: really are some spectacular trees in this
forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a great place to come walk your
dog or walk with your girlfriend or your
[SPEAKER_05]: buddies and just enjoy a few rips while
you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got my dabber all loaded over
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mothership's ready for one more rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had a call with Horatio,
Mr. D.
[SPEAKER_05]: Limanin himself, and he thought that he
was going to rip down this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to maybe go eat a little
lunch after this and then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: hook up with Horatio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not exactly sure what we'll do,
but we'll probably sit down, dab,
[SPEAKER_05]: hang out, talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it usually gets pretty deep with
Horatio.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's got a terpene thing that
we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys will definitely want to stay
tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Balancing my dabber full of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD Rene for those that want to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finding the glass containers to carve this
angled banger perfectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to give props to Quave for coming up
with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very impressive dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously people are going to come up and
start jacking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quave is the originator.
[SPEAKER_05]: DC Glass has done a great job though with
representing a pretty darn good nice thick
[SPEAKER_05]: quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave you with a little bit of the
forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey guys, I'm out of the forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in my car and lo and behold,
Horatio is here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you just appeared rather than
actually just spent the last two hours
[SPEAKER_00]: racing down the... While you were out,
you know, puffing, tuff, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean, forest, it was all a drive for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be here in two hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I don't know if I can hang out
that long.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've got some excitement,
don't we?
[SPEAKER_07]: We should let them know exactly what we're
going to do here next.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing out some stuff once we got
a little hot box session and then probably
[SPEAKER_01]: heading back to the lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a quick little rip here and then head
back to my zone and we're going to pull
[SPEAKER_07]: out a bunch of fun stuff and go through a
sort of terpene experiment with Horatio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some things still frozen in the pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can reach for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it's at, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the secrets lie in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not easy when you got to keep things
frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the zebra stripes though that
actually preserve the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The zebra zebra stripes are actually,
I'm pretty sure it's a scientific fact at
[SPEAKER_07]: this point that zebra stripes,
um, preserve terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you get pink piping,
then you pretty much, it'll never butter a
[SPEAKER_00]: white out straight up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I heard that the pink piping is
quite important.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the non buttering out factor.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give you a little ripper of this like
ancient bubble hash and then we use the
[SPEAKER_07]: glass jar to carb.
[SPEAKER_07]: We learned that today on mothership 101
with bubble man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice ripper.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been good.
[SPEAKER_07]: DC style just every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been raining here the last few days.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was kind of nice to just get out
still cloudy and dark, but perfect for
[SPEAKER_07]: just getting out and spending a few hours
in the forest ripping away while the
[SPEAKER_05]: police, you know, do their thing out on
the street and drive back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just, they're not worried.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just continue to do our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot boxing at the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't be the only ones hot boxing at
the mall in front of the bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so in front of the bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially after the epic places I've just
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, let's just hot box in
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, just pull over, just pull over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have a session in the bank.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's worried about the glass or the
torches or smoke effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just chilling in the car dash
truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you call this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Shane.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tipped it and it never spilled a drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still going for this plastic tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well that tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like astro boy or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably going to hit a couple more
of those, but the next time you see us,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling we'll be somewhere
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you find the carbonated water hits?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a surprise I only had.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first dry rip I took of it was not
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of grabbed me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oxygen.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it seems, it seemed fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be interesting to see what the
carbonated water filters versus
[SPEAKER_05]: non-carbonated water.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, at that point you could
get into the different pHs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get into reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get into distillated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you get into distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is literally stripping
everything it comes intact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has an upside and a downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find all the turps in your
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as well that I have a little bit
of a worry when it comes to distilled
[SPEAKER_05]: water, that it seems that it would strip
more good than bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I use it in my process,
but I'm using it in a spot in which I
[SPEAKER_00]: already know what it's going to do,
but it definitely, I would rather
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with carbonated water or other,
not that we're going to go around
[SPEAKER_00]: refilling our bongs with soda anytime
soon, but it is one of the unique
[SPEAKER_00]: capacities now that you're pairing water
with another molecule of carbon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, today just walking around with
the mothership really had me realize like
[SPEAKER_05]: first I went down to the right to the
ocean, had no water.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, wow, there's a whole ocean
full.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I filled it up from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoked an ocean dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Saltwater rips, saltwater rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I went into lighthouse park where it
was just dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no water anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I just kept going deeper
and deeper and deeper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to a point where there was this
little like creek of dribbling,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually water rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I, then I got that in there and
filled it up through here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm with you and we're doing
carbonated water.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really quite fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably we should do some type of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be boring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's artesian spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm, I'm looking, there's possibly
baby tear water, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unicorn made from babies tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you get really rich,
you could do a bubble run with baby tear
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a 20 gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to get, it's the
comments that are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the baby to your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, what we're really doing is
we're working on an upcoming episode of
[SPEAKER_05]: reading all your, um, um, how would I put
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Douchebaggery comments, hate arrayed
comments, reading just the nastiest,
[SPEAKER_05]: meanest comments that you guys write.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do an episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who's going to be in it with
me, but it'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just going to take about a
dozen, maybe more, write them all down and
[SPEAKER_05]: then we'll go through each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll kind of talk a little bit
about what it takes for a person,
[SPEAKER_05]: like for a person to watch a particular
video, maybe it's a 30 minute video and
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe, you know, the part they're talking
about is that like the 28th minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these guys have watched two thirds of
the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they must've gotten something
more out of it, but this is the thing that
[SPEAKER_05]: they choose to comment on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that guy squeaking his chair
though?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's interesting anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be up and coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to hear us making lots of
jokes as we get to that episode,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we want to get, we want to get you
guys commenting with your best comments
[SPEAKER_05]: that you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right guys, Horatio and I are out of
the car and we've head over to High
[SPEAKER_05]: Integrity Glass Art, who is shy and off
camera right now, actually doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful job of heating up.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you call that piece?
[SPEAKER_05]: The spinal?
[SPEAKER_05]: The spinal climb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spinal climb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was excited to pick up the pieces over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a right handed one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm left handed, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still works perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Time to be destroyed after a rip from the
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that ought to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spinal climb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gonna rip one of those Horatio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I often get really great quality highs
visiting him.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, similar, the one time I did hit
LHO, I got a really nice rush off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unfortunate because I had to leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife called me almost immediately after
and I was like, literally like,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, I guess I'm driving now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something most people don't really want to
do, like I got rocked in a good way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like, oh, I'm uncomfortable,
but just really, much the same way I get
[SPEAKER_05]: rocked when I take a nice hit from
something that's a, that higher end passes
[SPEAKER_05]: over.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Congolese 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so that's the top of the top right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grown to pure perfection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flattened out on parchment paper about
three minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to show you what she looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Horatio.
[SPEAKER_05]: That little OFZ is the optimized flavor
zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to admit, I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: First time I was past one, I was very
confused, but it's got a little lip in
[SPEAKER_05]: there and you're confused because you put
this big piece, the tube down into the
[SPEAKER_05]: quartz.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: OFZ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that just a lovely flavor?
[SPEAKER_05]: The dabs are big.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a big dab for sure,
but they're not small dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was tempted to take half of it,
but after I took half of it, I was like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a moment where you're like,
wait a minute, there's a full dab still on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a dab and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, all right, just finish
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just finish it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Push it through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're hitting out of such a
beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like you deserve to hit a rock
and roll dab on the day that you hit a
[SPEAKER_05]: piece such as this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got that sweat out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mothership on the edge there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always, always top quality at high
integrity glass art.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your purses?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the size maximum for me with
personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets any bigger than that,
it doesn't belong on my desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like something I'm going to hit
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible how actually handleable
this pipe is for these spinals.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually put your fingers on each
spinal column.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott, that's right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything he does, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so ridiculous, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott Dappe for the win.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that for a dab rag?
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So next up, the Brindle's Farms Mix Guava
and some other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was much more reasonable.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, I'd say a third to hit,
but still very tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always happy to be popping on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a machine over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cutting off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we're just like sitting here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's working it over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like me some guava.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a real nice flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else did you say might be in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love those blues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'll tell you the blue suede shoes
that the trichome heavy extracts guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: the melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: That they had in Amsterdam this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like blueberry yogurt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really did have a unique, like I wanted
to make dry sift with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's those things where I'm like,
the name just matches the effect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point, you know, you believe without
having to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Skunkman Sam was like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like everyone that smoked it or smelled it
was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to try that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right on guys, props on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a contender too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it took like second or third at
the, uh, legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I saw them up on stage as well at
the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if they entered dabidu,
but I'm sure if they did, they would have
[SPEAKER_05]: probably gotten some type of award there
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: They always seem to be in the top,
top rank.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is that nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know we were going to do another
rip in this very spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe next time we'll be somewhere
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not driving for like four hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, Horatio and bubble man back
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just finished up at high integrity
glass art and he just, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: annihilated us with three wicked hits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, really nice piece that we were puffing
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the Scott Deppies, always a
pleasure to hit a Scott Deppie piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see that spine piece personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Horatio's pulled out some of his train
wreck, uh, dry sift, which sorry to show.
[SPEAKER_05]: You my nasty dirty nails, but let's just
see if we can't show you the quality of
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get close enough or I think the
front camera wants to give us the love,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we'll show you another angle of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see we're sitting in front of my
tent here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got about six little plants in bloom
couple under the lush light over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the two XL dominator up and got an HPS
between Horatio and I.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to light that up Horatio,
[SPEAKER_04]: Lighten up the mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this looks like a really nice color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticky as fuck too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That train wreck is, that was the hardest
thing I've sifted so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ready to smear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to need to, that was a cold set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is going to be a nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, you can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is yours, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well you're going to hold the piece for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Shane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Shane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice, nice, nice sift on that one
Horatio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a tiny little hair on that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to clean that off and we'll
get you a rep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we got, uh, what do we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Atomical haze, um, watermelon over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got, uh, Congo, Afghani and Barb in the
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congo right here in the front and then
Afghani on the left side and just over to
[SPEAKER_05]: the right is Barbara.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either already producing nice little
round heads at only two weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're even out shining the Astro boy
over there, which will of course look
[SPEAKER_05]: really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's finally done, it's a,
it always does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about the shaky camera here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been a little bit of a cell phone
episode, but I figured better something
[SPEAKER_05]: than nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not ready to hold this for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wasn't ready either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stuck the dabber in with one hand
holding the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Oh yeah, this'll work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're going to film another video
after this, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's tell them a little bit about what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I brought by some wet, undried bud,
dried bud that comes from my turf
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of actually being able to go,
wow, I see what is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what is there, um, before the drying
process, which a lot of us don't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puffing in my garden with Horatio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to, uh, finish up this video
saying thanks for watching and joining.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully you puffed a bowl at least
every time we puffed a bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah, why don't we head up to the
office and film this next level episode of
[SPEAKER_05]: Terps and Herbs and Sifts and LHOs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this.
CFO.
[SPEAKER_05]: CFO.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you guys in a bit.
Bye.
Thanks for watching.
