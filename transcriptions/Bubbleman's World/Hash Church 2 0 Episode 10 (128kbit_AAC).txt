[SPEAKER_13]: All right, hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to Hash Church, episode 10 of Hash
Church 2.0, Buggleman here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will send out the link.
[SPEAKER_13]: Send out the link.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we do here on Hash Church at 9
a.m.
[SPEAKER_13]: every Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that we've done every Sunday morning
for the last few months, but we're getting
[SPEAKER_13]: back into the track of things here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it's a little bit difficult to
get a show organized, so these last couple
[SPEAKER_13]: of shows have really just been sort of fly
by the seat of my pants, invite whoever
[SPEAKER_13]: can come the night before, and kind of go
from there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll see who comes in now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got people popping in the chat room
all morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Ron Jones and John Maddox and
70s mamas in there and Rackham and Cuban
[SPEAKER_13]: Chronic and Cuban Grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be a good one.
[SPEAKER_13]: We already have 196 viewers in the room,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very, very quick.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is on like Donkey Kong, JF.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my headphones just fell out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I'll see if I can get those back
in.
[SPEAKER_12]: See if we'll get someone coming into the
room here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's gonna be difficult.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was plugging back the headphones in.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see if we can get some people in
this room here.
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, there's Tom.
[SPEAKER_12]: How you doing, Tom?
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning, Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we doing today?
[SPEAKER_12]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Trying to fix my... Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't plugged in all the way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could only hear you in one speaker.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got this shaky computer screen
because I'm trying to plug my headphones
[SPEAKER_13]: in from the front.
[SPEAKER_13]: How are things going by you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Going well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going well out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seasons are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The evenings are getting cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite time of year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're eating tomatoes and melons.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, you know what time of year it is
by what you're eating.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also love the harvest season,
but I also love it for another reason,
[SPEAKER_13]: that it is the reason that a variety of
psychedelic mushrooms tend to appear each
[SPEAKER_13]: year here in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be picking stunzies,
going to be picking semelanciadas,
[SPEAKER_13]: going to be picking cyanescens,
going to be picking azorescens,
[SPEAKER_13]: and baeocystens.
[SPEAKER_13]: All of those different psychedelic
mushrooms will be popping up here in
[SPEAKER_13]: British Columbia, really, probably within
the next month, month and a half,
[SPEAKER_13]: depending on the spots.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's always kind of a nice, just a
little bonus, a little nature bonus.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we just got through picking all of
our blackberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, everything's coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's nugging out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got this OG that just won't flip,
but probably needs another few days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, everything's going real
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Farmer Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_16]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_16]: How you doing, Mike?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's finally starting to clear up some of
the smoke out here in Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been an interesting summer.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was unreasonably beautiful all spring,
but it's been a little bit boxed in for
[SPEAKER_16]: smoke the past month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've been pretty lucky out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Portland, Vancouver area and the north
end of the Willamette Valley here,
[SPEAKER_04]: we seem to get not as much smoke as
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did have a few days, but on the long
run, after driving up and down the coast,
[SPEAKER_04]: we really had it pretty easy around here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, there's more wind traveling up and
down the Columbia Gorge.
[SPEAKER_16]: It helps keep the air clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an onshore breeze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we get this nice little breeze every
evening and this little microclimate that
[SPEAKER_04]: we live off of.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get this Columbia Gorge breeze.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts about one o'clock and goes to 11
o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really been an amazing place to
live.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit cooler here than,
let's say, in Portland or further south.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate the little
microclimates.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the things
everybody's got to get used to when
[SPEAKER_04]: they're growing out there, is figure out
where you're living.
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure out the microclimates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go talk to the other regular farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what they're up to.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll really get a good idea of how
things go in your little area.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome both to Mike and to Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm, of course, in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got smoked out hard this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we did last year, the last couple of
years have kind of been the worst two on
[SPEAKER_13]: record for a while.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the smoke has cleared up here as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got nice clear skies.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't smell it anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you doing, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good to see you here on this early Sunday
morning, I guess, mid evening for you in
[SPEAKER_13]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we got Dragonfly Earth Medicine
saying they were going to pop in a little
[SPEAKER_13]: bit later on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Wade said he was going to be
making it in.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Mark Chaldone said he was going to
be popping in for a bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll have a nice little chat today as
we did, maybe Cuban, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: He says he's real tired, but maybe he'll
come in and have a conversation with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Johnny B's holding down the chat
room in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Dave P from Function Junction.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on, Dave P?
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just in Function Junction the other
day visiting Whistler Medical.
[SPEAKER_13]: Went on a little tour there of both the
Whistler Medical in Whistler and the
[SPEAKER_13]: Whistler Medical in Pemberton.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have to say, like, I was extremely
impressed with the facility that they've
[SPEAKER_13]: built.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I love Whistler Medical in
Whistler.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just limited.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're in a smaller space, but they've
got a really beautiful building they built
[SPEAKER_13]: in Pemberton.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got a great group of people that
are just all about skiing and growing
[SPEAKER_13]: great herb, which, in my opinion,
is a wonderful foundation for owning a
[SPEAKER_13]: licensed facility here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people, their mission is to just
make cash, which, you know, I guess that's
[SPEAKER_13]: a mission as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: But as we all come from this industry for
so long, it's nice to have.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I got to mute you there, Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm coming through pretty hard on your
microphone.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just nice to have that foundation of
actual, you know, mission statement of
[SPEAKER_13]: quality over profits.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was very impressed with their
facility.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure I'll end up doing a tour over
there in the next little bit and maybe
[SPEAKER_13]: being able to do a video of showing the
whole flow.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is beyond impressive when it comes
to an indoor grow here in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_13]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you say more about the 80 acres under
glass?
[SPEAKER_13]: Not as of yet, Cosmic Lettuce,
but as that comes to fruition,
[SPEAKER_13]: I will.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it's a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was something I mentioned earlier in
chat room today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am going to be going and touring 80
acres under glass this week, upcoming
[SPEAKER_13]: week.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe I will do some video.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're growing some vegetables,
but they're looking at getting into the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis marketplace.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what better opportunity when you have
close to 100 acres of greenhouses to do
[SPEAKER_13]: such a thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so how was your experience after you
left Vancouver, Mike?
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you have a good week?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's been a pretty interesting week.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, my truck has given me issues,
as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_16]: So my truck's been in the shop for the
week, but it's been a good week.
[SPEAKER_16]: We ended up coming back and had a couple
meetings out here with a beverage company
[SPEAKER_16]: here in East Canada, out of the state,
looking at doing some investments with
[SPEAKER_16]: them.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, my truck's got to get some stuff
replaced.
[SPEAKER_16]: Maintaining a vehicle is required.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, I know it well.
[SPEAKER_16]: That facility though is definitely a nice
facility.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's bigger than most of the licensed
grows in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_16]: The largest grows in Washington are 30,000
square feet canopies, which you can have
[SPEAKER_16]: up to three of them on a parcel.
[SPEAKER_16]: But when you're looking at doing a large
scale hemp lab, you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_16]: source from multiple acres.
[SPEAKER_16]: So same thing's true in recreational
cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now that cannabis is going full federal
recreational, you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_16]: start seeing shifts from people growing
small, less than one acre parcels of
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis with 50 to 100 strains on them to
having an acre plus of each strain.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that really opens up the door on how
you can process cannabis and how you can
[SPEAKER_16]: vastly increase its availability to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's kind of one of the purposes
of Embark is to build this large scale
[SPEAKER_13]: extraction lab that does the quiver,
all the different levels of extraction
[SPEAKER_13]: that we can do legally here in Canada,
and then be able to offer to our customers
[SPEAKER_13]: to be able to come in with a small sample
of 10 or 20 kilos, run it through all the
[SPEAKER_13]: different processes, show them where their
strong points are, where their weak points
[SPEAKER_13]: are, and allow them to pick and choose the
type of extractions that they want to do,
[SPEAKER_13]: building up to eventually growing the
cannabis specifically for the type of
[SPEAKER_13]: extractions they want to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something that we're very
excited about.
[SPEAKER_13]: And definitely a company like Segara for
tissue culture is going to be a big part
[SPEAKER_13]: of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Having the lab is going to be a big part
of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then of course, the growers,
that's the magical Trinity right there
[SPEAKER_13]: where the growers are getting their
cultivars cleaned, free of microbial
[SPEAKER_13]: pathogen and fungi, and then being able to
acquire that for the lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we have a little bit of an
advantage in the sense that we don't have
[SPEAKER_13]: to deal with contaminants.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could imagine in a big, in a large
scale facility like that could become a
[SPEAKER_13]: problem for quarantine and could be a
problem for cross contamination of the
[SPEAKER_13]: machinery.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Kevin Monaco says, why not just kill
them?
[SPEAKER_13]: Why pass around shitty clones?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, just keep in mind, like 90% of
people are passing around shitty clones.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just because your clones don't show
powdery mildew or they don't show like
[SPEAKER_13]: bugs or botrytis or specific things that
are quite visible, there are all sorts of
[SPEAKER_13]: things that can impregnate your clones,
that can just slow it down, that can
[SPEAKER_13]: affect the expression of the terpene and
the cannabinoids that won't necessarily
[SPEAKER_13]: show you, you know, splotches on the
leaves or powdery mildew growing in the
[SPEAKER_13]: buds, but will affect the outcome of your
crop.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you're growing, you know,
80 acres or 10 acres or whatever,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you want it to be able to really have
the renewed vigor of a tissue culture
[SPEAKER_13]: plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want it to be clean, fresh,
and you want it to express itself to the
[SPEAKER_13]: maximum of its potential, of its genetic
potential.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the best way to take the cultivators
handing out dirty clones, the best way to
[SPEAKER_16]: put them out of business is by giving
consumers a better option.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can give consumers a genetically pure
clone that doesn't have any pathogens on
[SPEAKER_16]: it that's been taken through tissue
culture so it's had its genetic vigor
[SPEAKER_16]: restored.
[SPEAKER_16]: And being able to provide that to farmers
on a large scale, you can very rapidly be
[SPEAKER_16]: able to hand out a, you know,
hemogenetically test.
[SPEAKER_16]: You will say, yes, this cultivar at this
point in time won this award and this
[SPEAKER_16]: terroir, and plants are cultivating in
that terroir, this strain is probably
[SPEAKER_16]: going to do fairly well for you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because there's tons of different
microclimates that, you know, I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_16]: on some Google Gold right now,
but growing at Victoria Lativas in
[SPEAKER_16]: Washington State probably isn't the best
thing to do if you're trying to cultivate
[SPEAKER_16]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you can have, you know,
cultivars that are locally adapted to
[SPEAKER_16]: whatever state or whatever terroir you're
in, and then, you know, that really opens
[SPEAKER_16]: the door for farmers to be able to best
express the phenotypes themselves without
[SPEAKER_16]: having to worry about the basic things
like weed genetics or potential pathogens,
[SPEAKER_16]: or even potentially pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a ton of seed breeders out there
that are spending tons of time breeding
[SPEAKER_16]: out in stable genetics, and we want to
hand out and provide genetics to the
[SPEAKER_16]: consumers, to the producers.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: try to stand a little closer to your mic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, just trying to get a little
closer to your mic there, Mike,
[SPEAKER_13]: you were cutting out a tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, you know, these tissue culture
companies as well, part of what they
[SPEAKER_13]: really, you know, the most important
factor is their microbiology lab being
[SPEAKER_13]: able to fingerprint the genetic and let
you know that the platelets that you're
[SPEAKER_13]: buying is an accurate description,
an accurate genetic match.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of the plant you believe you're buying.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, of course, you know,
with the certification through the
[SPEAKER_13]: microbiology lab that there's not going to
be these certain pathogens and vectors for
[SPEAKER_13]: for problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's quiet now.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'll just keep talking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we'll load up a bowl here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Little a little vape exhale.
[SPEAKER_13]: I invited Sabo today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not sure if he's going to be able to make
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But hey, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, how are you doing there, Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Planet Fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that you were on Fish Tour,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're living out my dreams with all these
fish shows.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been so long since I've been to a
fish show.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's criminal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fish needs a couple of men back at the
show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I want to be back at the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's trusting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carota's light rig is just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like moves up and down during the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really, really incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out here to promote this company,
1906, which has collaborated with fish
[SPEAKER_03]: lyricist Tom Marshall to come up with two
different medicated chocolate products.
[SPEAKER_03]: One's called Bliss, which is a like a
Reese's peanut butter cup sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other is called Go, which is a
espresso bean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is Tom Marshall's signature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see Tom Marshall is the lyricist,
primary lyricist of Fish and Trey
[SPEAKER_03]: Anastasia's songwriting partner.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard they were entering.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I heard rumors that they were
going to be dwelling in.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, Cuban, by the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I could have helped but not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Click and join in, you know, to set up and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wash my face off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though you're exhausted.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, yeah, dude, not exhausted.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like I like a fucking
psychedelic exhaustion level where I
[SPEAKER_10]: sometimes I think I hear and see things,
but it's really that probably haven't
[SPEAKER_10]: slept eight hours in days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, like I said, I was what's that
mark hash exhaustion like tennis elbow,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a, you know, dogs, the work,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A casualty of the industry or what you do,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, no, I'm not tired because of the
hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually haven't made much hash this
year, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I think that in all of 2018,
I probably didn't do maybe not even a
[SPEAKER_10]: week's worth of what I did in 2015.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not hash, but I am raising pubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a litter of 14 day old pups and
they need they need to get fed every two
[SPEAKER_10]: to three hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: And at first, they're kind of quiet.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you can set a bed next to the
whopping box and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when they start making noise and
they're sleeping all day, but crying all
[SPEAKER_10]: night, dude, it's fucking rough.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel you on that hash thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I haven't been making as much
myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm ready to gear up.
[SPEAKER_13]: But going to Whistler a couple of weeks
ago, we just we worked for about four
[SPEAKER_13]: hours and we made almost two kilos of
dried bubble.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love this sort of industrial scaling up of
hashing and not pulling these like 10 and
[SPEAKER_13]: 20 20 gram bags, but pulling these like
multi ounce screens that, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: add up to many, many kilos after after a
short period of time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was just out of the 250 litre
machine.
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't even use the thousand litre
machine.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can imagine once we start dumping
40 or 50 dry kilos into one of those large
[SPEAKER_13]: scale units, that we'll be able to make
maybe five kilos in a shot or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe a little more.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as soon as you posted the video of the
washer a couple of weeks ago, people
[SPEAKER_10]: started hitting me up like, you know,
check out this bad ass machine,
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobo man's using.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's pretty bad ass indeed.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I noticed that it stirs from the top.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: A washer spin from the bottom without any
correct material.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm a big believer on the chamber.
[SPEAKER_10]: Spinning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I love the chamber spinning.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why we really designed the
large scale unit.
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing that we didn't really share is
the is the spinner, the linear actuator
[SPEAKER_13]: and what it actually looks like and how
much time and energy it took to design
[SPEAKER_13]: that to actually spin the material.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all of the material gets spin rather
than just some simple thing that spins and
[SPEAKER_13]: the material doesn't get touched.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the problem in a GE EU GMP certified
facility like it is federally here in
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada, microbials are a big problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you spin from the bottom,
you are going to have some serious
[SPEAKER_13]: problems with bacteria unless you can take
that machine apart every single time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the real problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love spinning from the bottom Cuban and
we're not stopping.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can tell you that the people that
have figured it out, like if you take
[SPEAKER_13]: those machines apart and you look in the
bottom, there's going to be things that
[SPEAKER_13]: get captured.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to take the machine apart every
single time you mix.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it really becomes a problem for
workflow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe if you had many, many units and you
were able to run fresh batches in each
[SPEAKER_13]: reactor throughout your day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the day, you steam clean
or autoclave all of these stainless steel
[SPEAKER_13]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the real problem is having that thing
spinning at the bottom and having water
[SPEAKER_13]: and hash get into that area and stay and
not clean out properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you're looking at a microbial
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_13]: And for Health Canada, they just won't
pass it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It won't be able to be sold.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is one of our problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm 100% on point with you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the spinning from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_13]: At the same time, we're getting 17 to 20%
yields out of the water hash that we're
[SPEAKER_13]: running up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it's as low as 12%.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what these guys have done with their
data points and the mixing, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: they'll mix for, you know, an hour plus,
but they'll stop it at five minutes,
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a graph that's been created
for each different cultivar where you can
[SPEAKER_13]: see where it actually starts, starts
really clearing out the material.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this has been a problem with bubble
hash for a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's easy to get the good stuff off.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all I ever really promoted.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's an enormous amount of stuff
that's left over that can be used in plant
[SPEAKER_13]: fat extractions that can be used in all
sorts of different other sort of products.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was getting left behind and people
were always just like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting 10 or 12%.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were quite happy with it,
but getting upwards of 17, 20% and even
[SPEAKER_13]: 25% return on bubble hash is something
that we are actually pretty stoked about.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we sell these machines,
all of that data is coming with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it comes along with the IP of the
different cultivars, the graphs for each
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivar, the mixing times, and the shape
and size of the blade that goes into spin.
[SPEAKER_13]: So 100% on point and very, very,
very good question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I'm on board with you on the
sterilizing the washers or the vessels
[SPEAKER_10]: every run.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any plant matter or what they call here,
it's funny in California, they call
[SPEAKER_10]: material biomass.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a crazy term.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as long as you have biomass water and
you leave it in a chamber, even a small
[SPEAKER_10]: particle can contaminate the hash days
after if it runs through.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we modify the washers every run.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you can still fabricate something
with that minimalistic concept in mind
[SPEAKER_10]: with easily removable parts, not a lot of
little nooks and crannies to clean it in
[SPEAKER_10]: between runs, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, not as easy as you would think.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're definitely trying and working on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just looking at the Delta
separations units up on the Sunshine Coast
[SPEAKER_13]: the other day.
[SPEAKER_13]: My buddy's got one of those.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it mixes from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it only really runs a couple,
you know, two to six pounds at a time,
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe eight pounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not even sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking at 40 and 50 kilo runs and
maybe even eventually getting it bigger
[SPEAKER_13]: than that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to, you know, the lab that I'm
building, and Mike's going to be a big
[SPEAKER_13]: part of this, we want to bring him on for
the CO2 extraction and to help with other
[SPEAKER_13]: parts of the isolate and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're really looking to make sure that the
traditional hash rooms, and I say
[SPEAKER_13]: traditional in the sense of water
extraction, dry sifting and rosin versus
[SPEAKER_13]: the solvent extractions like cryoethanol
versus the CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make sure that the hash has a
footprint that is at least substantial
[SPEAKER_13]: compared to the oil that we're going to be
producing, because the cryoethanol that
[SPEAKER_13]: we're going to be doing has the
capabilities of processing almost 10,000
[SPEAKER_13]: pounds per day of plant matter.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so to be able to do that much,
you know, even at 50 kilos, every two
[SPEAKER_13]: hours in the thousand litre reactor and we
get four of those reactors, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: that kilos of water hash run every two
hours, we could probably do about a
[SPEAKER_13]: thousand kilos a day through the water
hash extractors.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still, you know, only 10% of what's
going to be produced in the oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: So of course, me being a solventless guy,
I love the idea of getting that up as high
[SPEAKER_13]: as we can.
[SPEAKER_13]: And any time you scale anything up,
generally there are these arcs that
[SPEAKER_13]: happen, these sort of exponential arcs
that occur.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just becomes a little bit more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_13]: You never really realise, like with water
hash, it's the threshing ratios that you
[SPEAKER_13]: get where you, how much threshing versus
how much water versus how much ice versus
[SPEAKER_13]: how much plant matter is in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It changes as the reactor gets bigger and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you really have to accord to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm definitely on point with you in
the sense that I love the idea of a bottom
[SPEAKER_13]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've thought of a few different
ideas.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got engineers on this.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've moved this well beyond hash makers.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've hired engineers who are very much
engineers, they're mechanical engineers.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what they think about.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all about putting those two
groups of people together.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Whistler Technologies is really sort
of pushing the forefront on this right now
[SPEAKER_13]: with hiring engineers to sit with hash
makers and to work together to overcome
[SPEAKER_13]: these obstacles.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because an engineer will come up with all
these ideas based on not really
[SPEAKER_13]: understanding the subtle nuances of the
resin gland and the breaking of the resin
[SPEAKER_13]: gland and how it sinks in the water.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the hash makers really tuned into
these things, collecting the hash
[SPEAKER_13]: workflow, whereas the engineers just
trying to solve problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you put those two people together,
I think there's going to be some real
[SPEAKER_13]: breakthroughs in the upcoming year or
years with water extraction, as well as
[SPEAKER_13]: dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, you have to I personally don't
have the balls to run that much material
[SPEAKER_10]: at one time, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like my biggest fear, like fucking
something up like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I always do like washers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever had like a washer drain or
just fuck up and you're like, man,
[SPEAKER_13]: thank God, it's just a pound straight up
to the scalability thing is terrifying.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I read a really good quote from
someone recently.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was if your dreams aren't terrifying
you, if your dreams aren't making you
[SPEAKER_13]: terrified, then you need to, you know,
dream bigger.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really that really resonated with
me, you know, I was like, OK, I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: on point because I'm like, you know,
one minute I'm like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the next minute I'm having an
anxiety attack.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, holy shit, like this is this is this
is this could be too much.
[SPEAKER_13]: This could be heiress, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like you said, a pound is a pound of
50 kilos is 50 kilos.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, welcome to Wade Laughter and to D420.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kay, who just showed up into the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have a story.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to get this question out real quick
before I have a bad memory, bro,
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoke too much and I forget.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Last church, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I take so many dabs by by the end of the
church, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like blast.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you need to get some alpha pining
dominant terpene cultivars and push those
[SPEAKER_13]: mercy and cultivars to the side for a bit,
because you'll you'll get that focus back.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll get that, you know, real focus
back.
[SPEAKER_13]: But go ahead, ask your question.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how are you draining these 50 kilos at
a time?
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely not through no 20 gal bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: That means you must be designing some
heat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't see you didn't see those
screens.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see what you're going to drink
of resin through, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they steel stainless steel?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, engineers, dude,
like you said, they're good at solutions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they bring shit like that,
I'm like, no, man, don't reinvent the
[SPEAKER_10]: wheel.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bag with the mesh is the shape.
[SPEAKER_10]: But now that I see you with the mesh.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you see the bottom here,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a very good but the bottom right
here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's about 60,000 U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what it does is it vibrates and you
can set it to vibrate so it's offset or
[SPEAKER_13]: onset.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can there's all these different
settings that you can do in the stainless
[SPEAKER_13]: steel screens.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can vibrate them so the patterns
travel in one direction, travel in the
[SPEAKER_13]: other direction, go towards the center,
go towards the outward area.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is unbelievable to watch, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm telling you, you would be like a kid
in a fucking candy store watching this
[SPEAKER_13]: thing operate.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the but it's no joke.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're definitely they're definitely
costly units.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're from the mining industry and the
amount of control that you have over them.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the first time I saw it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just like, yes, this is absolutely
on point.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was super glad that, you know,
give a shout out to Daniel and Kelvin and
[SPEAKER_13]: all the crew over at Whistler
Technologies.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm super stoked to join that team and
just move water extraction and dry sifting
[SPEAKER_13]: into this, I guess, industrial scale that
is so needed without the worry,
[SPEAKER_13]: which everyone's always got the worry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Cuban just sort of pointed it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not it's not just, you know,
mucking up the pound.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's losing the quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: What we're trying to do is create
something that can not sacrifice the
[SPEAKER_13]: quality, but acquire the quality in that
first pass and then still acquire the rest
[SPEAKER_13]: of the of the of the actual resin without
just doing plant fat extractions or
[SPEAKER_13]: solvent extractions.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to really be able to get as much
of that hash off in the traditional ways,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is microencapsulated resin glands.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, maybe there's not maybe a lot of
people don't think it's different,
[SPEAKER_13]: but cannabinoids that have been melted off
with heat or solvents are just different
[SPEAKER_13]: from the microencapsulated resins.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's why some people prefer hash and
some people prefer oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love having both of them in my quiver.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can imagine for many, many years I
smoked only hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would not smoke solvent extracted hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all there really was.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when rosin came out, that was huge
for me because suddenly now I was able to
[SPEAKER_13]: play around with oil when, you know,
ask someone like Dee, who's known me for a
[SPEAKER_13]: long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I ever smoke oil?
[SPEAKER_13]: The answer is fuck no.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he's frozen up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I tried to hand you some a long
time when we first met and you were very
[SPEAKER_02]: polite and said, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give this to some of my employees and
they might like it, but I don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you saw what I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That changed, changed my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Changed it right there and then definitely
changed your direction at least.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the, uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, um, the volcano, you brought out a
little bit of real shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my always all go to, to sell these
out of my store too, was coming to the
[SPEAKER_02]: back and I'll take some leaf out that I've
had for about two years and I'll put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the little thing there and we'll vape it
and tell me how you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tastes like fucking killer hash
every time I'd sell them every time,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like that, just because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you did to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put a little of this in there
and try that out.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, people always kind of laugh
about older material.
[SPEAKER_13]: A big problem in the Canadian,
uh, situation, LP situation is sometimes
[SPEAKER_13]: before they get their license,
they'll, well, I was talking to a guy
[SPEAKER_13]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's got 300,000 grams in his vault.
[SPEAKER_13]: He hasn't sold a gram yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: They just got their license to sell
yesterday and people are always like,
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you know, who wants to smoke year old
resin?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that's, that's bunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can assure you that it is not bunk,
especially from a hash maker's
[SPEAKER_13]: perspective, cured resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes wonderful, wonderful hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some here, some rosin that I made.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is some harmony.
[SPEAKER_13]: This was on bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: I grew in 2012.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the bud was six years old and I pulled
it out of my freezer.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I put this under people's noses,
every single time it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: The eyebrows go up and the wow comes out
of their mouth.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not because I'm some amazing
grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really more that the cultivar was
special.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got it from reefer man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the harmony.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has an absolute fucking beautiful nose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Super stinky.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can smell it from like, you know,
a hundred feet away type of thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I opened it at a show, people come in
depending on the way the air is flowing,
[SPEAKER_13]: but nobody can believe that that shit is
six years old.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it was left in herb, you know,
in bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I froze the bud and I just squished it
maybe three or four months ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I'm not even sure, but you can do some
amazing things with older material.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the most important thing was you
have it frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, my God, that's what makes the
difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can freeze resin for a decade.
[SPEAKER_08]: You barely change it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what, you know, that's,
that's what you can do if you're forced to
[SPEAKER_13]: have herb in storage for long periods of
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't let it be ruined.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just store it in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can even freeze it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if it starts raining and stuff,
you can harvest the plants, freeze them,
[SPEAKER_08]: before you dried them at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then what you can do is you can take them
out later as you need them and hang them
[SPEAKER_08]: up to dry, let them dry in a normal two
week dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: The color changes a little bit,
but colors darken up a little bit from the
[SPEAKER_08]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But except for that, man, it works totally
easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything you say is firsthand
experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you guarantee.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did this to crops?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_08]: People I know didn't have enough room to
drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: They lived in a little tiny shack and they
had no place else to drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but they had a freezer, deep freeze.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they filled it up and pulled it out,
you know, as they had room and it worked
[SPEAKER_08]: all fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: It reminds me of Switzerland back in like
early 2000.
[SPEAKER_13]: 2001, 2002 when suddenly, you know,
they were kind of allowing it as an
[SPEAKER_13]: aromatherapy product.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you put the bud in a little,
little pillow pouch, they could sell it at
[SPEAKER_13]: stores.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so people were growing just,
there was no licensing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Swiss style.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just like, yeah, you can just grow
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so people were like, boom,
like putting up acres and acres and acres,
[SPEAKER_13]: just the most ridiculous amount of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of the barns that I saw,
I mean, it was, it was inspiring.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it was like heart wrenching
because it was so much of the material.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure you guys remember Indra
talking about this back in the day of like
[SPEAKER_13]: him going in and cleaning out the mouse
piss and the mouse shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the, the herb just molded.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just, they packed it so tight into
these barns cause they didn't have enough
[SPEAKER_13]: room to dry it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it would have just been incredible had
they had a system where they could freeze
[SPEAKER_13]: at a large scale freezers and just,
you know, process it as, as they could,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and that's, that's the problem
with biomass.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can only process a hundred,
a hundred kilos a day and you've harvested
[SPEAKER_13]: three or 400,000 kilos, you're,
you're just, it's not, it's, it's not
[SPEAKER_13]: going to be conducive to a proper
workflow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might not be easy either.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that Sam?
[SPEAKER_08]: Freezing that large amount may not be that
easy either.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd have to have one hell of a big
freezer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm looking at them right now,
industrial scale, you know, the half a
[SPEAKER_13]: million to million dollar freeze dryers
and man, are they inspirational?
[SPEAKER_13]: The, the, you know, to be able to freeze
dry 50 kilos, or five, 10, 10 to 50 kilos
[SPEAKER_13]: of bubble at a time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can put about, I think it's about five
kilos in a freeze dryer in a, in a
[SPEAKER_13]: harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think in the big, the large scientific
one, you can do about five kilos.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to be able to do 50 to a hundred
kilos without having a wall of freeze
[SPEAKER_13]: dryers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've been looking at these industrial
ones and they are no joke.
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the apple industry, they actually
will bring pieces of apple to actually
[SPEAKER_16]: build warehouses.
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll pull all the air out of those
warehouses and replace it with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_16]: In a way.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure that this industry will be
building custom built drying warehouses.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: I suspect as well that you'll have large
scale refrigeration and pulling the oxygen
[SPEAKER_13]: out of the air and replacing it with
nitrogen is definitely another way to,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, I mean, there's, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny, Mike, because all of these
things that we're looking to discover are
[SPEAKER_13]: already being done in other industries.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like almost every aspect of what we're
looking to do for scalability,
[SPEAKER_13]: when it comes into the tissue culture
aspect, when it comes into large scale
[SPEAKER_13]: freezing, and drying, curing, when it
comes to large scale processing,
[SPEAKER_13]: these things already exist on a very large
scale throughout the agricultural
[SPEAKER_13]: community, uh, in, in from seed crops to
vegetables to, to whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just going to be really a matter
of, you know, tweaking out some of those
[SPEAKER_13]: things and, and getting proper engineers
with proper hash makers and harvesters and
[SPEAKER_13]: trimmers and cures, and all the people
that do all these different jobs to get
[SPEAKER_13]: these things really, you know,
sort of created into a proper,
[SPEAKER_13]: proper workflow that, uh, that,
um, that will, that won't sacrifice
[SPEAKER_13]: quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't forget the chemist.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, man, I could never forget the
chemist.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of what we're doing, Mark,
is, uh, is chemistry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure we're going to have you out
at one point in time to come visit this
[SPEAKER_13]: place because it's going to be the Willy
Wonka, uh, chemistry lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were describing sieving before
Mark, that's, um, very similar to a
[SPEAKER_03]: process that's used in the pigment
industry to separate pigment for paint and
[SPEAKER_03]: coatings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they have these industrial sievers
on scales that you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would fill silos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just huge, gigantic thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing I'll say is one thing I've
always learned, and I guess you guys will
[SPEAKER_03]: learn this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone will learn this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what you do, whenever you scale
something up, like if you're taking
[SPEAKER_03]: something from like the experimental R and
D scale to maybe like the smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: production scale to the like ultimate,
like huge levels of production,
[SPEAKER_03]: you always find new, I won't call them
issues, but just things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always new things to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're working at such a small scale,
you may not realize that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: generating, say something that could do
what chemists would call a runaway
[SPEAKER_03]: reaction, which is something that you
couldn't, necessarily predict on a really
[SPEAKER_03]: small scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you have stuff sitting around at
that temperature, at that stage in the
[SPEAKER_03]: process, now you're going to have heat
buildup or something else is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you always, always find new stuff
whenever you go to, it's just like making
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee, you know, making coffee in a,
in a, in a K cup versus making a pot of
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee versus just making huge amounts of
coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just, it's totally,
it's a, you always find new shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you were talking about microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll build up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always just set sediments that
build up sedimentation and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: batch processes, which it sounds like most
of what you guys are running or what I
[SPEAKER_03]: would call a batch process as opposed to a
continuous process, which is just a switch
[SPEAKER_03]: that you turn on and oil comes out or hash
comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some continuous, like, think of like
a VTA unit is like the oil machine,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you have it backed up with
precursor, you just turn on that switch
[SPEAKER_03]: and oil machine just oil starts coming
out, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a continuous process versus a batch
process, which are like your two liters
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller, you know, distillation where you
need to like fill it each time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like baking a cake, you, you make your
distillate and then you need to clean it
[SPEAKER_03]: out and you need to, you know,
the cleaning as a, you know, really a
[SPEAKER_03]: function of the overall process is one of
the most important parts to make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: you clean your reactor and get everything
clean for the next batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have, you know, contamination
and it's just, it's a really important
[SPEAKER_03]: thing when you go to scale things up,
if you were to take like a two liter,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, distillation and go to like a 20
liter distillation, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: issues that you just can't predict until
you're running that distillation and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing that equipment, you know,
you're- No, that's why, listen,
[SPEAKER_13]: you have to, you have to design these
units specifically with the intent of not
[SPEAKER_13]: only producing that quality and the,
the quality quantity as well, but with the
[SPEAKER_13]: in mind that you're going to be needing to
clean these units a lot and the cleaning
[SPEAKER_13]: has to be effective and it has to be a
part of the workflow and it has to be
[SPEAKER_13]: somewhat quick.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't have downtime for days because
you need to clean your monster unit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, it's, it's super important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I muted you there, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just- Yeah, the other thing I wanted to
add, and again, people who are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, again, thinking about this kind
of thing is you want to add an area in
[SPEAKER_03]: your facility for this cleaning because
you don't want to have that cleaning in
[SPEAKER_03]: your production area.
[SPEAKER_03]: You almost want to take it into like a
side area where you can do cleaning away
[SPEAKER_03]: from like, if you can back it up with a
second unit while your team is cleaning
[SPEAKER_03]: one unit, you could, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you want, you want to allocate
space for cleaning if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: putting a floor plan or planning the use
of space and area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cleaning space is a, is well,
you know, use space in this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: operation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, absolutely agreed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I guess the cryo-ethanol unit can
work by just running ethanol through the
[SPEAKER_13]: unit.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't really have to like take that
unit away and- Yeah, are you talking
[SPEAKER_03]: free-floating plant material or is it in
socks or like how, how is the
[SPEAKER_03]: cryo-ethanol?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that, that, all that IP belongs to
my partner, Anthony, who runs Infinite CBD
[SPEAKER_13]: and Cinertech down in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: So he, he'd really be the one to talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to be the one running that
aspect of the lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a CO2 or an ethanol guy,
but we'll get him on past church here one
[SPEAKER_13]: of these days.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe even today, I'll invite him on to
talk a little bit about cryo-ethanol.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if he's coming, if he's coming to
the fish show, check me out at the Bliss
[SPEAKER_03]: Lounge before the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Marshall is going to be there and
signing people's things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to get a selfie with Tom
Marshall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, say hi and, um, yeah,
if he's listening, let's, let's hook up at
[SPEAKER_03]: the, at the Bliss Lounge at Dick's at
Fish, if you're going to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I wish we were here too, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll channel you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a live stream tonight and I'll put
you on camera, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that's, that's the way I go to fish
shows now, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look vicariously through me,
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll, we'll, we'll set you up.
[SPEAKER_13]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mr. Miner, Mr. Miner also sends me his
couch, uh, uh, tour links.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, so I got to give Mr. Miner a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know Mr. Miner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know him pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've danced around that dude for damn near
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: 20, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hank Schwab.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people at the shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, our curve ball,
this festival here in upstate New York was
[SPEAKER_03]: canceled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you heard this,
but yeah, there was a camp, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw the photo of the guy telling Trey on
stage while it was helping happening.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was all over it, but I should say,
thank you, Mr. Miner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a real heartbreaking thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, there's a lot of energy from
that closed down festival that kind of is
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of centralized here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, last night of the three night
run tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So well, fun,
[SPEAKER_13]: small poncho pop poncho says small batch
will always be the highest grade.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, I tend to agree with him,
but it's also the obstacle that I want to
[SPEAKER_13]: turn into the opportunity to change that
statement.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see that statement change.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was really skunk man, Sam,
who kind of changed that for me when,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, we were sitting down one time
and he just said, you know, all these
[SPEAKER_13]: people that think you can't grow super
awesome herb, large scale are just wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know because I've done it and I've seen
it and I've, you know, he has,
[SPEAKER_13]: he's grown like fields of cannabis that
are like of the highest quality that if
[SPEAKER_13]: you extracted the resin and you smoked it,
you surely wouldn't be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like at the top echelon of greatness.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm thinking, why can't we two do
the same thing with extraction?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we need to do to make it
available, to make it accessible for
[SPEAKER_13]: everyone, the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to figure out that obstacle of
overcoming scalability.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's a mission that I'm on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Marcus, I just wanted to comment on
temperature too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, whenever you look at any
chemical degradation process, the cooler
[SPEAKER_03]: you could make things, the slower that
degradation process becomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you think things cold in the dark
and dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good advice.
[SPEAKER_13]: 100% good advice.
[SPEAKER_13]: And definitely something that we're paying
careful attention to cold, cold,
[SPEAKER_13]: cold, cold, cold.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to design this problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to remember these chiller units
throw a lot of heat into the room that
[SPEAKER_03]: they live in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if like, if your, if your area is like
a confined area and you have chiller units
[SPEAKER_03]: that are running to chill various parts of
your operation, those chillers throw a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of heat in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to make sure that,
you know, again, you have a way to remove
[SPEAKER_03]: the heat from that room if you can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, these are all parts of the
design.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking at putting certain things on
the roof.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were trying to get them on the outside
of the building, but some of the
[SPEAKER_13]: limitations with the property footprint
won't allow for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're definitely on the first meeting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I walked through first with Mike.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did a great video with Mike in this
facility.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be able to release it at one point
in time, but you know, the project's just
[SPEAKER_13]: in its infancy stages.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to kind of leave that as a
little bit more on the down low,
[SPEAKER_13]: but definitely the second walkthrough that
I did, well, actually the fourth or fifth
[SPEAKER_13]: walkthrough I did was with a team of 25
people, construction, electricians,
[SPEAKER_13]: engineers, architects, the whole nine
yards we started walking through this
[SPEAKER_13]: facility.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's quite incredible when you get
that many brilliant minds together,
[SPEAKER_13]: specifically, you know, a lot of moving
parts to start focusing on, on a project.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you just go room by room and you just
basically, you write down the pain points,
[SPEAKER_13]: the obstacles that are in your way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you get those minds on,
you know, taking those pain points apart
[SPEAKER_13]: and, and offering relief to each one.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's an exciting thing to be a part of,
obviously, you know, like Cuban mentioned,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's this large scale fear that comes
with large scale scalability, but you
[SPEAKER_13]: can't let that fear keep you from pushing
the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we may not be the only ones that
are doing this, but the work that we do is
[SPEAKER_13]: definitely going to affect the community,
much like the work that, that we did with
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble bags over the years has,
has deeply affected us.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has affected the community.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'll tell you, 1999 pre bubble
bags was a different world in the world of
[SPEAKER_13]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a real different world.
[SPEAKER_13]: This whole full melt bubble and you know,
99.9% heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, Sam was on the boat, but he was,
it was a very lonely journey because he
[SPEAKER_13]: was literally the only one.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so now, you know, most people on this
panel have made it have, have access to
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just kind of a no brainer,
water, ice, beautiful plant matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Five years ago when I built my first walk
in freezer so that I could operate a
[SPEAKER_08]: rotary center and a process, you know,
50 or so kilos a day, really easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, there was no going back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, once I realized that I could
operate this dry sifting machine in the
[SPEAKER_08]: middle of the summertime when it was hot
and humid, which normally that puts a
[SPEAKER_08]: screeching halt to dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you've got it cold and dry,
then you can do it year round.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have to freeze the material
overnight and work with it in the morning
[SPEAKER_08]: and keep it working cold and dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's a big changer.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the beautiful things about
living in Canada, I will say, because the
[SPEAKER_13]: winters tend to be cold and dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you've obviously seen some of the
dry sifting videos, I hope that I put out
[SPEAKER_13]: on bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_08]: He works when the winter is that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't invent it was invented by people
in Afghanistan and other places and says
[SPEAKER_08]: the best sifting is when it's cold and
dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you may not have invented it,
but you certainly had a deep impact on the
[SPEAKER_13]: world of hash makers.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you just in that moment where
you allowed me to photograph your resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I first met Sam back in the day,
he was just he was almost like there was
[SPEAKER_13]: all I was almost afraid.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was like the professor.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just had so much knowledge.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't want to offend him.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't, you know, he's very particular
fellow in the sense that that he was just
[SPEAKER_13]: he just was a no fuck around kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, you know, if you know,
I didn't even want to ask him,
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, can I photograph your resin?
[SPEAKER_13]: But at one point, after a few trips to his
house, I asked, I said, Hey, can I can I
[SPEAKER_13]: photograph your resume?
[SPEAKER_13]: He was like, Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_13]: Then that you know, that photograph of
that ninety nine point nine percent heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the first time that a photograph
like that showed up on the Internet in the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll tell you, it really, really,
really affected a lot of people in regards
[SPEAKER_13]: to what can be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It showed the masses.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I shit myself damn near when I took that
picture in your living room, when I saw
[SPEAKER_13]: what was before I took the picture,
when I focused the camera and saw what
[SPEAKER_13]: you're hash looked like under a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just couldn't I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could not believe that you did that with
dry dry sifting, like that you didn't that
[SPEAKER_13]: you didn't use water.
[SPEAKER_13]: Water just was so easy to extract the
heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then it's also extracting these water
solubles.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pulling something out.
[SPEAKER_13]: The water's smelly.
[SPEAKER_13]: The water's dark.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not staying in the hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, Sam had all of that
presence in his hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was definitely a big shout out to
him.
[SPEAKER_13]: And shout out to Cuban for helping keep
the popularization going.
[SPEAKER_13]: And shout out to D420K and shout out to
all the hash makers for that for that
[SPEAKER_13]: matter, as well as the growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because shit, we are nothing without you.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are nothing without the growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my that's my humble opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we get a nice big bomb rip or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother of growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the the seed makers and the
people collecting seeds worldwide?
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the land race farmers?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll shout out the land.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll shout out everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep going, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll shout out the land race farmers.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll shout out the seed collectors,
because those those guys did some
[SPEAKER_13]: important work collecting, you know,
Sam going and living in all the hash
[SPEAKER_13]: producing countries and collecting those
seeds back in a time where it was,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, probably fairly dangerous to do
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Work.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was also huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the land race farmers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the present land race farmers are
really only, you know, they're they're
[SPEAKER_08]: just the present caretakers of the
heritage, because these some of these land
[SPEAKER_08]: races, I mean, the heritage has been going
on for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's quite interesting the the shoulders
of giants that we all sit upon,
[SPEAKER_13]: whether you are aware of the history that
brought this to you or not.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the prohibition that occurred,
you know, the yanking of the teeth out in
[SPEAKER_13]: the Cairo Square for the for the Sufis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like a lot of people suffered a lot of
years for this plant to thrive and
[SPEAKER_13]: continue to be collected, to be grown,
to be processed and to be vaporized.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the sharing of information.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that that's powerful, too,
you know, from generation to generation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like the Internet really blew
things up, too, when it came to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to like that picture that you took
and of Sam's work.
[SPEAKER_10]: It motivated me to be able to figure out
what to do with a bunch of Keith that I
[SPEAKER_10]: had sitting around without the Internet
would have never seen it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so that's powerful.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got a I had a thought because the
other a lot of people are like,
[SPEAKER_10]: man, water is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I heard you say it last week.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't get into those type of talks
because to me, you know, if it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: butane or whatever, then to me,
hash is hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if water is a solvent, is Keith and
dry sift the only real deal non solvent?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's the least it's the least
footprint.
[SPEAKER_13]: So whenever you use anything to extract,
you leave a footprint or you extract
[SPEAKER_13]: something that leaves that footprint.
[SPEAKER_13]: So with water hash, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever we're pulling out into the water
is our footprint.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's what's been removed from the hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's those processes occur in all
forms of extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with with two solvents, leave behind
some of the alcohol or the pho.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you test it afterwards,
you can usually find a tiny bit of that
[SPEAKER_08]: with water.
[SPEAKER_08]: All you got to do is drag and the
footprint is gone from the materials.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's still you know, and I will say
this, Cuban, the highest quality of water
[SPEAKER_13]: hash I've had is absolutely on point for
the highest quality dry sift that I've had
[SPEAKER_13]: when you break into those those 10s,
ie it's been grown like a 10 out of 10.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been processed and cured like a 10
out of 10.
[SPEAKER_13]: To me, they're right on par.
[SPEAKER_13]: But generally, most people's water hash is
not a 10.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anytime you get like a sift that's a
nine point whatever or upwards of a 10,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's going to seem nicer than most water
hashes.
[SPEAKER_13]: That being said, when you have that six
star water hash that drips away to nothing
[SPEAKER_13]: and has all the flavor of the bud,
for me, they're both on point,
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have a hard time picking one over
the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just don't get the same yields for dry
sift most people that you can get with
[SPEAKER_08]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get much higher yields.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's true as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, even when we were in Jamaica and
you had that beautiful dry sift and we
[SPEAKER_13]: made that beautiful water hash,
I think we smoked them both pretty I don't
[SPEAKER_13]: remember just smoking all of the dry sift
till it was gone and then smoking the
[SPEAKER_13]: water hash, which is generally what I do
when something's just better.
[SPEAKER_13]: If something's much better, it's a very
easy decision.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's why I kind of had that idea for
legends where legends of hash,
[SPEAKER_13]: we don't have to judge it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we just put like a gram or two
grams of everybody's hash out on the table
[SPEAKER_13]: on a separate plate and the hash that's
gone first and just taking, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: a hit, not taking like half a gram each
time, but just taking your one or two hits
[SPEAKER_13]: from each one because there's could be 20
or 30 or 40 varieties on the table and
[SPEAKER_13]: that's 20 or 30 or 40 hits.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just take one hit of each one and see
which one you go back to because it
[SPEAKER_13]: whittles down like any connoisseur,
40 cultivars on the table.
[SPEAKER_13]: He'll know the top five right away by
looking at them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then by smoking them, he'll whittle it
down to like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just keep taking it until it's gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's sort of like a nod to the
hash maker.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very much like how some of the Babas do it
in Shivaratri in Nepal when it's Shiva's
[SPEAKER_13]: birthday and they have these hash
gatherings.
[SPEAKER_13]: My manufacturers told me that's exactly
how they do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They put it out on the plate and whoever's
plate is empty first, everyone,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, gives their respect that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's a really kind of cool
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The people's choice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They did that similar style with a third
gen, the invitational.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a nice dinner.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had everyone brought their own jar
and it just started getting passed around
[SPEAKER_10]: until there was a unanimous decision of
who had the heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't attend, but it sounded cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely get that water hash and dry
sift comparison.
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I really like water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like water hash more than dry sift
myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's good water hash, aro, proper fresh
frozen, like slow spin first wash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't spin for 15 minutes and give me that
90 because I'm not going to like that over
[SPEAKER_10]: dry sift, but some nice like dripping to
water is good.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when people start making water hash
and they use tap water or some filtered
[SPEAKER_10]: water, and then there's like some of that
hard water taste, no matter how good the
[SPEAKER_10]: resin is.
[SPEAKER_13]: How about some fluoridated ice?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could taste that stuff because I've
taste pure resin when I make dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I'm trying to do is like enhance
that terpene with the fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes, but not add calcium and
magnesium and all that other weird shit
[SPEAKER_10]: from like not good source water or ice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So water hash, you know, it all depends on
who's making it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I only smoke water hash between the
Perrier.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he likes the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Sam's style.
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried to sneak some Fiji bubble,
some Fiji water bubble, and he was not
[SPEAKER_13]: having it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I like that carbonation, you know,
just CO2 water extract just does it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know where it pops and gets on your
face when you're dabbing it?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like popping and that's how you
get off those bulbous heads on the plant
[SPEAKER_10]: matter, huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: With the Perrier just bubbles them right
off.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, dude, it's a secret tech.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Five hundred and thirty six people are
watching.
[SPEAKER_13]: Including the Dragonfly Earth Medicine
crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, all five hundred thirty six women
have to real quickly promise not to tell
[SPEAKER_08]: you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they're all promising now in chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Sunday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys look all profesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been having conferences today and
now we're just in a hotel room in Spokane.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I love it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys clean up well, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're good looking people.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that you guys were in the garden
last week and now you're like in the
[SPEAKER_13]: straight like hotel room.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're like, look, we like to keep a foot
in the corporate world, but we're also
[SPEAKER_13]: very much Dragonfly Earth Medicine people
and we like to grow the medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cultivation is our main thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, to us, that's the beginning.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we like we like home birth and
natural births for human beings as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also really like, you know,
natural cultivation and, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: pure cultivation.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really important to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were just shouting out the hash makers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we were shouting out the growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Sam, of course, in his great
wisdom was like, hey, what about like the
[SPEAKER_13]: land race?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's stewards, the people who
have been like and the seed collectors
[SPEAKER_13]: that went and gathered these seeds like
who it definitely you can follow it way,
[SPEAKER_13]: way, way, way back.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'll give props to all of the aspects
of cannabis space brothers who brought the
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds to the land race.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: The space brothers who came down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where were they from?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sirius B or something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or was that the dolphin people?
[SPEAKER_13]: We just lost 200 people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, Mark Seldone is going to going to
comment on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take myself off mute, but I don't have
anything to say.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that you're this, you know,
analytical chemist mind, but you're like
[SPEAKER_13]: super trippy fish dude as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: You must just hear some great things at
these fish shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blame it on Garcia, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all because I was spun out kid on
dead tour in the 80s, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: following just being passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what Jerry Garcia teaches
us is to be passionate and what we do and
[SPEAKER_03]: to understand everything that's happened
before you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you really have to have an
appreciation just like music and science.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have an appreciation of
everything that's happened before you.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to internalize it and then do
something new.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's where humility comes in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Humility comes into play because you have
to be humble to accept those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one of my best qualities,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the other thing that you have
to really do is you have to really figure
[SPEAKER_03]: that the best way you can learn is just
keep the channels of communication open.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even like hash church or the the chat
room and the chat room is just I think the
[SPEAKER_03]: best thing about having a hash church is
waking up to know that this whole group of
[SPEAKER_03]: people even before the program starts is
in the room, you know, and I can tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like the same 50 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're there every time, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as you bless us with the idea
of, hey, we're going to have an episode
[SPEAKER_03]: this week, there's already like a cosmic
gathering, kind of like the way there used
[SPEAKER_03]: to be at a Grateful Dutch show.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just knew they would come because
it was there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely a pretty cool way of
looking at it and definitely a big shout
[SPEAKER_13]: out to the core group, the 70s mamas and
the Bingo Lombardy's, the Taste Bud 420s.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he just said Taste Bud 420.
[SPEAKER_13]: We never leave, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I set up the chat room on on like
Monday tomorrow for next week,
[SPEAKER_13]: there will be like a big chunk of them in
there for the whole week, which is great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's this it's this passing around of
ideas, that open dialogue.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you get a lot of people in the fear
and scarcity world in that corporate greed
[SPEAKER_13]: of like, oh, I got it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to make sure it's kind of musical
chairs, but with a ball and it's dialogue.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's the ball is the logos.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the language.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we pass that ball around.
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes it lands on someone and it
cracks open.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the timing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so many people are afraid of that,
that it's not going to land on them.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've just locked it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not sharing anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they don't they're not really active
in the dialogue.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is sort of a problem,
I'm sure, in many aspects of life,
[SPEAKER_13]: but definitely in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big problem that people are just
afraid to see those great ideas go around,
[SPEAKER_13]: land on someone and then have it blow up
for them.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good with whoever it lands on as long
as we keep the dialogue going.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you say there, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm just kind of like hanging
out here doing what we love to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Making some sift.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, kind of like doing all the
separation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting it done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B.'s getting it done.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always have to do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'm hoping that solventless mind
comes in today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did pass him the link and he was going
to come in today while he washed some
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble so we could have I think every hash
church there should be some hash making.
[SPEAKER_13]: That just seems like like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got this beside me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually cooling this room off as you
were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So my old lab room where I had my GC is
now my cold room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice in here.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice and chilly.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got the microscope sitting right here
and I get to play.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're all white it out in the white
room.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in the white room.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in the white room now.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a nicer room to be in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, I mean, it's quieter in here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have to have the headphones on.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can work and I can meet you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if that's what Eric Clapton was
singing about in the white room.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, one thing I've seen with all of
these labs that we're seeing, they're all
[SPEAKER_15]: white.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_15]: At least with white, you can see if
there's any dirt or anything on the walls
[SPEAKER_15]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So and it was easy to build this room.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody needs a hash room.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was the goal behind this room in
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_15]: This was my hash room before I was going
to build a yoga studio.
[SPEAKER_15]: And make it a hot, cold room.
[SPEAKER_15]: But instead, I built myself a nice little
hash room because I'm making hash for the
[SPEAKER_15]: rest of my life, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to like Bingo Lombardi's
quote, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B with the banging.
[SPEAKER_13]: Still.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Got to do the stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, I mean, I got my brush.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got my cards.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got all my little chicks and everything
else that you guys have showed me what
[SPEAKER_15]: I've learned over the years from from you
and everybody else in the industry that
[SPEAKER_15]: has showed me so much.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty cool to see how things are
going and what you're doing, dude,
[SPEAKER_15]: on a huge scale.
[SPEAKER_15]: We talked about that and how people are
changing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was talking with some people,
some hemp farmers and what's going on in
[SPEAKER_15]: Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's some pretty crazy stuff,
how they're able to start separating
[SPEAKER_15]: everything from the fields now so they can
now have those tricones from the plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty amazing what they're doing out
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: They got a whole collective.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're getting all the farmers from
all the hemp fields are coming out all in
[SPEAKER_15]: and they're doing what I'm thinking
basically to a processing plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's pretty cool and they needed
this on an industrial scale.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's the next level of this whole
industry is being able to.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be that we're going to be
that processing plant or at least one of
[SPEAKER_13]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the first time I was in
California in Central Valley and Central
[SPEAKER_08]: California, excuse me, and I saw them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pulling a harvesting machine and there was
12 people sitting in a row as it pulled
[SPEAKER_08]: through the roads of beans and the people
that were doing the work were walking in
[SPEAKER_08]: front of this machine and they would feed
it into the machine, everything that they
[SPEAKER_08]: were picking from the beans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't think there was people
walking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the machines was pulling the beans
off of the bean plants and then feeding
[SPEAKER_08]: them to people who were sitting in rows
and they were boxing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the boxes were being quick
frozen, not quick frozen, but quick
[SPEAKER_08]: chilled.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they were being sent to the
retailers and the wholesalers all across
[SPEAKER_08]: the nation.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that will be the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be picked in the field and quick
chilled or frozen and then sent to a
[SPEAKER_08]: processing plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be at the other end there,
Mark, grabbing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: With a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_13]: The dream come true.
[SPEAKER_13]: So where are you guys at, Josh and Kelly?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you guys at?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Spokane right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often we come down here, but where we're
at right now as far as the industry goes
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're just every day, every day in the
soil, every day in the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: every day in our breeding rooms,
same thing that we've been doing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: past 26 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although the industry is changing and
there's a lot of things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, it's still like we have to keep
our focus and what it is that we came here
[SPEAKER_00]: for and how we brought this forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important, you know, we're keeping
our focus on the farm and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, bombs going off everywhere
and lots of people giving us offers and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just really keeping our head
down and really playing the game of
[SPEAKER_00]: humility because we feel like it's really
important and that's what we need to show
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant every day is humility.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also see that the world is in a
clean cannabis shortage.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we find that, you know,
that, you know, the cultivation needs to
[SPEAKER_11]: be really thought out in order to be like
as clean as we all want it to be and
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a big part of our work and the
certification that we created and working
[SPEAKER_11]: with other ones, you know, that are being
created too that are outside of ours.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we're just working really
diligently on clean cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we always free up our education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were talking about passing
information around and it's actually very
[SPEAKER_00]: rare for humans to have original thought,
you know, humanity doesn't come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: original thought too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can have good thoughts that we
pass around easily and freely,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's the way that we're going to be
able to bring up the whole race of
[SPEAKER_00]: humanity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, Bob Snodgrass told us a
really great story one time, which,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, he's such an amazing person and
everything that he's done for glass and
[SPEAKER_11]: everything over the years is his algebra
teacher in high school taught him about
[SPEAKER_11]: the bell curve with knowledge that humans,
you know, all know a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_11]: knowledge and they're rising up,
but the curve is more flat.
[SPEAKER_11]: But once everyone starts sharing
information, the knowledge goes up really
[SPEAKER_11]: sharply and our humanity, you know,
and our abilities to do things,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, gets much greater because we're
sharing information and that's really what
[SPEAKER_11]: we evolve, you know, more as a race when
we're sharing things with each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we feel like that's what we want to be
a part of.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I should hook you guys up with Mike West
while you're out in Spokane.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just left the chat room, but he's I'm
pretty sure in Spokane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we got Johnny B sifting.
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you doing today, Wade?
[SPEAKER_13]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thumbs up from Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm doing good actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the weather's cooled off a little bit
here and the big news in our world at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment is mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the plus side, the California
legislature passed a bunch of bills
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday was their last day or Friday was
the last day of the legislative session
[SPEAKER_01]: for this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Senate Bill 829, which we've been
pushing pretty hard for, passed out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly and the Senate and has gone to
the governor for a signature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were enough yes votes that if he
vetoes it, it will go into a law anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were I think two or three out of 60
some in the assembly and two in the Senate
[SPEAKER_01]: who voted no and everyone else voted yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows compassionate use licensing
and not really sure it's like any law how
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulations play out is going to have
a huge impact on how it actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's great enthusiasm for it among
the regulators, they recognize that
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate medical need that's not always
based on ability to pay is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the model in California for a long
time has been about giving it away to
[SPEAKER_01]: people who need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wham was one of the first entities I knew
of doing that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there were a number of other
bills defining premises and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the state is trying its best to
sort out all the problems that have come
[SPEAKER_01]: with regulation in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the downside, some of the kids in the
network, the kids with epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_01]: including Silas, Forest's son are dealing
with a lot of seizures right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silas had a series of grandmas night
before last.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just Silas, it's a number of
other kids in the network.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what's going on in the in
the world, other than the insanity that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in the world that's affecting
these kids.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, how are the how are the fires
there?
[SPEAKER_13]: How's the smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: The the smoke has been good in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several of the big fires are mostly
contained.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that was happening down in
southern Mendocino and Lake County,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're pretty much contained it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's like a hundred and some
thousand acres, the biggest fire
[SPEAKER_01]: California has ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still early in the fire season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all kind of holding our breath.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if that could be a part of it,
though.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, maybe it's not affecting you
know, most people, but people that are
[SPEAKER_13]: people that are sensitive like that,
you know, with with seizures and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_13]: any little stress on their system can
cause that to to fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would make perfect sense that
we humans are uniquely sensitive to our
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very capable of dealing with all
kinds of craziness unless we have
[SPEAKER_01]: compromises in our well-being and other
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were doing shout outs
earlier to all the people that have had
[SPEAKER_01]: helped the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to pipe up and give a shout out
to the plant herself for surviving all
[SPEAKER_01]: this prohibition that's been going on and
give thanks to all the humans who have
[SPEAKER_01]: worked with her to see this amazing
unveiling of what's possible with this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like with all the craziness
that's going on in the world, I mean my
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life I've been dreaming about,
as the Rastas used to say, the herb is the
[SPEAKER_01]: healing of the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And give thanks for all of us and all of
those who have come before us and to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, the amazing, beautiful cannabis,
selenius, sativa, indica, ruderalis,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, yeah, this plant takes water,
soil, and light and turns it into oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty trippy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel deep, deep, deep gratitude for
this plant and its part in my life and for
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've seen it can do for other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where Wade's at at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love to all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hanging out and just listening mostly
because I'm in awe of the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: gather around you for Hash Church,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome, Wade.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for your positive words,
as always.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember, look who came to visit
me?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Chief Seven Turtles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott Sebastian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a champion plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't forget about the plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm moving to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally was able to get the hell out of
Iowa and we're looking for houses right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, good on you, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in good company.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember I talked to you like a year
or two ago?
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're on maybe like two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's amazing that that much time
has even gone by.
[SPEAKER_13]: These conversations just, people have an
interest in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: To just tell your friends I'm in a legal
state now and I'm interested in all the
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff I learned in industry I can use in
cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm sure you won't have a hard time
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: My God, that place seems to be popping.
[SPEAKER_05]: What place?
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, God.
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked all over Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked in California and we just keep
coming back to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it seems like you're not the only
ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Colorado seems to have a growth going on
with people interested in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like out of all the states,
it has some pretty decent ranks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a mature market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mature market, especially for
connoisseur products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what you see now, very prevalent
in the stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in rare dank this yesterday and got
some live resin, but yeah, no slabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really see shatter anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see a lot more diamonds and sauce and
yeah, some solventless.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of diamonds and sauce,
people seem to like that product category
[SPEAKER_03]: out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's the hottest of the hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the newest of the new.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the Instagram fame, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hashtag diamonds.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, of course people are all over
that shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Instagram is kind of trippy how it directs
the popularity of what people are going to
[SPEAKER_13]: produce.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not in the fact that it's tasty and sweet
and gets you super ripped, I guess,
[SPEAKER_13]: are all factors.
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of, where's Dan?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Darren, can you please say your important
sentence?
[SPEAKER_13]: He's talking right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see him having a big conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got us on mute, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Darren, Darren, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my bro come brought me coffee.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can keep talking to him.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just needed a quick bong rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all bong rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm loading one up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to sit here and spend all my
time sifting.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm definitely going to smoke it with
beeline on glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say that, you know,
it would be nice to see a lot more organic
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivation in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one thing that is a little,
they're a little light on the organic
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd love to see that community get a
lot more charged out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a good thing always.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's one of the things I love
about Whistler Pemberton, the Whistler
[SPEAKER_13]: Medical.
[SPEAKER_13]: They grow organically.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're, you know, one of the few that are
pumping out the OGs and it's just nice to
[SPEAKER_13]: be around.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice to be in rooms that are,
that's like made of like soil,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, not that I'm like dissing on the
other options or whatnot, but I will also
[SPEAKER_13]: say that generally I don't know exactly
what the noticeable differences in the
[SPEAKER_13]: actual resin gland.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure how much of that is absorbing
like pesticides or foliar sprays or
[SPEAKER_13]: whatnot, but definitely I could say that
material like that was grown outdoor
[SPEAKER_13]: organically, but not flushed and just had
like the darkest ash ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I made hash from it and it was just like,
I smoked it and loved it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I remember people just complaining.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were like, oh, you got that sweet
skunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were like, really?
[SPEAKER_13]: I was kind of disappointed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, well, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it took me a while to figure out that
they were all smoking the flower and the
[SPEAKER_13]: ash was burning super dark.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was smoking the hash and that
leaving the food in the plant didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: affect the resin really at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you guys have to say about that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, there's a number of cases where
the resin glands do suck up pesticides and
[SPEAKER_11]: fail tests.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's, there's got a giant list of
farms that, you know, would really
[SPEAKER_11]: disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if the resin glands are clean and
nice and they could be really similar,
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess our biggest mission in life is to
show that the cultivation of the resin to
[SPEAKER_11]: begin with, there's so much waste that
goes into cultivating flowers from rock
[SPEAKER_11]: wool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's so much energy use that goes
into it that you really, if you want to
[SPEAKER_11]: factor in all of the carbon footprint that
goes with it or the trash footprint,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, you'd have to be really
concerned.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, it's the amount of like
every single time you grow something out
[SPEAKER_11]: of those large scale operations out of
rock wool, you have to throw all that
[SPEAKER_11]: away.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's, you know, on all the tubes,
it's not, it's people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, there is so
much that we don't know about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: still, you know, now we're just being able
to get funding to be able to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and to be able to understand what
it is that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that, you know,
I'm hoping that cannabis will have the
[SPEAKER_00]: last laugh, that it can't be, you know,
controlled in the same way that tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: has been controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tobacco was taken over,
the plants totally in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, it was like the big
corporations got a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then no more real studies and tests
really came out of it after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as organic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, you know, maybe she will
have the last laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that she produces a lot of cannabinoids
and terpenes and things that she produces
[SPEAKER_00]: into herself when she's really happy and
in a soil situation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also like believe in origins and we
really resonate with like Wade and what he
[SPEAKER_11]: has to say big enough to plant and the
origins of the soil and the earth and all
[SPEAKER_11]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for us, that's what we recognize.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we recognize the naturalness and
we recognize the plant and its full
[SPEAKER_11]: potential.
[SPEAKER_11]: So some of the organic growers,
they need to, maybe they, they flush to
[SPEAKER_11]: make their ash look better for people and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the end of the day, you know,
if they're doing a really, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: conscious grow and stuff, you know,
it does have to burn correctly for the
[SPEAKER_11]: consumer and all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, if it's bad for the earth,
but it smokes well, I just don't see that
[SPEAKER_11]: as a good thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, I feel, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm definitely not, you know, stoked on
the use of pesticides, even though,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, 99.9% of people eat it on their
food for almost every single meal that
[SPEAKER_13]: they have as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: As well as the clothes that they wear,
as well as the vehicles that they drive,
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as it's just so saturated into our
system.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to see us get rid of as many
of these things as possible and create a
[SPEAKER_13]: more sort of synergistic symbiotic
experience for the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't seem sustainable, to say the
least, to continue to poison everything on
[SPEAKER_13]: such a mass scale that, you know,
we cause pollution and great disruptions
[SPEAKER_13]: in our oceans and our nature cycles.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is what it is, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're such a reactionary society,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: In America, we don't do anything until,
we're not proactive, we're reactionary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like when you see a salmonella
outbreak or any of those things that go
[SPEAKER_04]: after the processor, they go after the
farm, but they don't change the general
[SPEAKER_04]: overall problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in Japan, there's 0.00 parts per
million of any kind of fecal or any kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of microbial matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: In South Korea, there's 0.3, 0.03,
and then in Europe, it's 0.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but in America, it's 5,000 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really live in a super toxic
society, not being able to make money and
[SPEAKER_04]: turn a profit at our expense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe that organics is the only way
to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: The small farmer, we really have to work
on to make the home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Home grow really concerns me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna try to get rid of it in
every state.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been successful here in
Washington, and they're gonna stay near
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, without the home grow and the
small farmer, you know, and people out
[SPEAKER_04]: there, there's a lot of, there's no new
thing on such a massive scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to focus on smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been teaching a class at Clark
College here in Vancouver, cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: your health, and then I do a how growers
do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a three hour intensive on taking your
plants to harvest for highest yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really love to show everybody the
clean organic route to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason we shouldn't be taking
that route.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better for the environment,
you know, and then we got to think of dube
[SPEAKER_04]: tube thing and the Mylar bags and how bad
are those?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're choking out our oceans.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find them in my ditches out here in the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really, really, really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as cannabis and stewards of
the land, we really need to put our best
[SPEAKER_04]: foot forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really believe the growers who care
about it and the processes who really care
[SPEAKER_04]: about it are putting their product in
glass jars and they're using biodegradable
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just must as we continue on or we're
just gonna destroy our planet earth even
[SPEAKER_04]: more.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's kind of the right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the quiver of access in the sense of
we need exactly what you're teaching that
[SPEAKER_13]: small scale, you know, scalability where
people are doing it for themselves,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's just never going to happen for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be a percentage of people
that do it that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So then we also need large scale and that
can't be done in a toxic level.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to be done in a way that's like
we're smart enough to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no reason why scalability has to
be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it should never phase out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Small scale, small scale should always
have a place in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always want to have my own garden in the
back.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always want to be able to process my own
stuff a variety of ways at home.
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, I know so many
people out there who that's never going to
[SPEAKER_13]: be the reality for them ever, just the way
they don't raise their own chickens to eat
[SPEAKER_13]: eggs every morning, just the way they
don't make their own clothes from their,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, nettle that they grow in their
backyard.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just there's both both sides need to
exist.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, like people like my mom,
for example, like she is most comfortable
[SPEAKER_13]: ordering her cannabis from a large scale
facility.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just comfortable to her.
[SPEAKER_13]: She just goes online.
[SPEAKER_13]: She gets it done.
[SPEAKER_13]: She feels good about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: She's not opposed to going into
dispensaries, but she's worked for the
[SPEAKER_13]: police for 35 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the law is a big part of it as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just see both sides being fairly
valid.
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, I'm sitting here going,
I want to go as large as I can.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Tom's like, I want to teach small
scale.
[SPEAKER_13]: I totally respect what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: But think that that large scale has its
place as well to give people those room
[SPEAKER_04]: for all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have our space in this cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everybody has their own little
position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it takes all of us to get this plan
and to get this industry in the right
[SPEAKER_04]: place where it's it's actually benefiting
people and benefiting the planet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's definitely that's definitely
a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we want it to be more positive
and beneficial in that sense that there
[SPEAKER_13]: are a lot of people just think of the
amount of pesticides that have been
[SPEAKER_13]: sprayed on cannabis alone, even in the
black market over the, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: the last four or five decades.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a that is a lot of pesticides or
even wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just did a case study on 100
different wines in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one thing that we're not
testing for in cannabis, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which is glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 100 percent of those tests came out
with, you know, really high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of our pesticide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when people go and bring their
cannabis in, they're not testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go and you bring your soil sample
in, you have to pay extra to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really encourage people to do
glyphosate tests because their amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: may be OMRI certified, but they may be
still spraying glyphosate, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: on their alfalfa that they can buy in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you utilize that in large amounts
on your soil, then you're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: having massive microbiology die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that then goes up
into the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see the plant, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't glyphosate just kill the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, glyphosate doesn't kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glyphosate is utilized in, say,
maybe, you know, if you're buying large
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of alfalfa and that you want to
talk about using glyphosate on the ganja.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're talking about the inputs that
come in that we use for the ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're finding we're doing massive
tests on a lot of these inputs that people
[SPEAKER_00]: think are organic or think that are
natural or think that are whole foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're coming out really high in
glyphosate levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get calls from some people and
we're saying, hey, you know, our soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming acidic over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look all the way through it
and we find out, wow, this alfalfa that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been adding on weekly has
glyphosate in it and is killing your
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology, which in turn is making your
soil acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just looking at, like,
the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What goes into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What creates the finished product?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how can we be responsible from
the very first ripple that we do on our
[SPEAKER_00]: farms?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, Marcus, you made a good point.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, toxicity is everywhere and Tom and
the toxicity is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when we have an opportunity to
choose something, we're going to choose
[SPEAKER_11]: the natural thing because we're already
inundated with all the toxins everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think about, you know, Grass Valley
and stuff down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, charcoal and carbon in the air is
going to suck out all the toxins in the
[SPEAKER_11]: air and then it's going to fall on people
and they're going to be breathing in
[SPEAKER_11]: carbon that it's known to suck up toxins.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you take activated charcoal
every day to flush the toxins out of your
[SPEAKER_11]: body and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we just believe,
you know, toxicity in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_11]: toxicity in life is probably our biggest
work.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we love growing and cultivating
everything, but like talking about the
[SPEAKER_11]: toxicity, it's a bit of a big thing,
you know, and it's something we really
care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start to delineate and you
really look at what it is that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: eating or what it is that you're putting
in your gardens, like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus, toxicity is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can do our very best and do our
research and talk to the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: already doing a good job in organics and
how they're doing it and share
[SPEAKER_00]: information, then we can bring this plant
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that, you know,
like Wade, you were saying, we do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: give big ups to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's brought us all the way this far and
we're having, you know, a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an equal relationship, the plant and
the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is it that we can do the best by
the plant so she can do the best by us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's one of the beauties
of the Dragonfly Earth medicine approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Closed loop systems, like if you're
talking about alfalfa, instead of buying
[SPEAKER_01]: alfalfa that's likely been treated with
various things like glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy alfalfa seed and put it in the ground
and get it so it's self seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meantime, your compost streams
everything by generating your own inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you can only do this if you
have enough space and a place to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think any place, anybody that can
have a garden where you can grow tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can grow beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do it responsibly in the way
that you guys talk about closed loop
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, you know, worms, your own compost
piles, ferments, mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about restoring the environment in
the place that you're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about, cannabis can be a resource
extraction industry or it could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: resource rebuilding environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the regenerative aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it is true, you know,
like in getting to what you add on to your
[SPEAKER_00]: to your soils and what you're adding into
your reservoirs or whatever to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: where those come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you were saying, wait,
yeah, closed loop systems, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to remind everybody,
you know, we did a numbers game a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago on how much each one of our
plants, you know, cost us to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grow huge, massive monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That put out a whole lot of pounds,
you know, and for BC, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent $24 on each plant,
$24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that really takes a lot
of the stress out of.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how you stay in business.
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing is, let's not forget what
we what we know about the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's not forget what we learned,
what we learned.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a my it's a remediating plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sucks up what's in the earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to be seriously careful what we
put in there if we want the clean,
[SPEAKER_11]: safe access that we all are talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our peer certification is is is where
it sets people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a certification to put rules
and regulations on people by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being able to give farmers the tools
that they can pass their concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they pass their flowers so that when
they go to market that they're successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's like,
here's a list of a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they're feeding their mind with
healthy food that they're growing on the
[SPEAKER_11]: farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true that the food is covered in
myclobutanol.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get strawberries right now and
testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's myclobutanol.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem with myclobutanol is the
smoking of it and it turning into cyanide.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, it is a thing and that's why
we're passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're working in Canada now,
too, and starting to create dialogue
[SPEAKER_11]: about, you know, a new co-op and new
answers to the Bill C-45 and what's
[SPEAKER_11]: happening in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is our work to combine like-minded
people here in Canada and create a new
[SPEAKER_11]: system that can be recognized,
you know, for the people of Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that some people that want the LP and
the large scale operations, they can buy
[SPEAKER_11]: that from them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And no one's trying to get rid of that and
no one will be able to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're also trying to keep that
conscious culture of the herb.
[SPEAKER_11]: The herb is a natural thing that makes our
minds open and makes us want to feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And safe access, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talk about safe access and
safe access doesn't mean just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being able to access it,
but that it is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who have medical issues,
which, you know, I'm sorry to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're looking at a massive amount of
people on this planet that have medical
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare that I meet people that,
you know, are even eating organically and
[SPEAKER_00]: running every day that are not having
issues, you know, with the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins that are in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really owe it to those people to give
them good, safe, clean access.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's really important that we
educate these people and educate these big
[SPEAKER_04]: industry people that organics is a cheaper
route.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a more sustainable route.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, people are going to be looking for
that clean, organic route.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about people's health.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more toxins the earth gets,
the more toxic we get, the more things
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody's looking for the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis is, but it's got to be clean,
organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really starts, like you said,
with the inputs and knowing the sources
[SPEAKER_04]: and the whole way through the genetics,
how it's been handled the whole way
[SPEAKER_04]: through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, in education, we can really
change things at a big level.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess the big problem is the
profit margins, you know, it's the,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's the, it's the people are locked into
these profit margins in the now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there, I think that, you know,
I don't exactly know how to put it into
[SPEAKER_13]: words, but you just always see,
especially with the scalability where
[SPEAKER_13]: people are just like, yeah, we're doing it
this way now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just like spraying all these hearts.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pesticides.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just unbelievable how much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, look at the price of organic food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it's out of this world and all
the salts and these salt mixtures that are
[SPEAKER_04]: putting in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, you can really taste the
end, in the end product, at least I can,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I'm open to smoking a lot of deep
cannabis, but I was kind of like mine,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cause I grew it and I took care
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I think everybody should have,
be able to on some kind of scale if they
[SPEAKER_04]: had the desire.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be able to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you really know what's going on
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's been our lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife, you know, has a, has immune
system problems her whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've found a farm with good clean
well water and where we can pretty much
[SPEAKER_04]: take care of ourselves through cannabis
and all the vegetables we grow and fruits
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's a full, it's a full cycle
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really keeps her healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's healthier now than she's ever been
in her life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that she's out there working side by
side with me in the garden, day in and day
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's an amazing woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really have, I think a lot of people
are going to know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the clean organic lifestyle is,
is going to be the healthiest way.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to live a long,
healthful life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, unfortunately,
a lot of these big corporations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into the cannabis industry right
now are looking towards big ag to be their
[SPEAKER_00]: educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, but when is big ag had good
ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken all of our soils,
they've ruined it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the ones that are saying we
know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate that a lot of these
big corporations are not looking towards
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the cannabis farmers that have been
doing this for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going straight and direct to
department of bags and agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: education, which to me is just dumbing us
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a place for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, me neither.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, you know, I've been able to
educate a lot of people along the way on
[SPEAKER_04]: organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had the federal government
here, seven agents from the CDC,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I got to educate them on production
and processing of organic cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_04]: we do it here on our farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's brought,
opened up a lot of, a lot of opportunities
[SPEAKER_04]: for me to get out there and keep educating
about organics and the sustainable ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like I said, at the end of the
day, we got to live here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And organics is the only way and
sustainability is the only way I see us
[SPEAKER_04]: getting out alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question for Chief Seven Turtles.
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of breeding is it that you want
to do with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone knows Chief Seven Turtles from
Sense of Million Tip Days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott, you wrote what?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live in Oregon, you probably heard
of Sense of Million Tips.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the first journals back in
the 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote like three articles on breeding,
just basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one was called, was about
reciprocal recurrent selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow, to answer your question,
I've already given two talks at the
[SPEAKER_05]: University of Wisconsin about like what
they do, you know, how we use,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, how we did breeding in industry,
and then how I would apply it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second seminar was about how
I would apply that to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was packed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both seminars were packed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said it was the first seminar
ever given on cannabis breeding at the
[SPEAKER_05]: university, because it's still illegal
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really interesting two days.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, this has nothing to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, can you describe the technique?
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, this has nothing to do with
organic versus pesticide.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's how to make better selection
decisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, the techniques I learned
were how to pick the best plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: even if it's in the wrong part of the
field and it doesn't like if you select it
[SPEAKER_05]: by its genetics, you'll pick the right
plant, regardless if it's not been
[SPEAKER_05]: nurtured properly, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can explain all that stuff to you
guys later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a whole seminar about it,
and I'm going to try to give it this week
[SPEAKER_05]: at the University of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark's going to hook me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado State.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado State, which is where they do the
hemp breeding and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wouldn't knock industry too much,
because they're like 10 years ahead of
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody else in terms of how to use
molecular markers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what my specialty was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was all native traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't do any transgenics or any of
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand exactly what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: But from molecular markers or genetic
markers for breeding from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's hardly any of them identified yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, that will be the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I heard through Grapevine,
all the traits are being mapped right now
[SPEAKER_05]: at private companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not sharing all the information,
because it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to develop intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're trying to develop
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guarantee you, there's enough people
working on this that somebody is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: set up a company that will just genotype,
and they'll do it really cheaply,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they'll do the whole genome,
not just specific traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll be able to, like I said
earlier, it would take a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: A long time to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's very, very efficient and very
smart technology.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does Phylos Bioscience do that?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't Phylos Bioscience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Phylos has already done the
fingerprinting, so they can tell this is
[SPEAKER_05]: different from this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the next step is this is better than
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what they do with cows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all this stuff is... So functional
genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called marker-assisted selection,
or mass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just take a smear of each plant,
and you can tell from that smear whether
[SPEAKER_08]: it's more appropriate for the particular
genes you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my specialty was complex traits like
yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that you have to handle in a different
way, because there's not like specific
[SPEAKER_05]: yield genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are yield genes, but they have a
different effect in every background.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to study each background
separately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that knowledge is not well-known,
not even in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was something that was top secret
when I was working at Pioneer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm finally allowed to talk about it
because I published a couple of papers on
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't easy to get permission to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have the rights to use that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll explain it to everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I read your papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you read them, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's probably already patented your
process, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not patenting things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want... No, I patented it, he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: He patented your process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, did you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Power to you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, I've been waiting for two years
to do this, but I married a Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took us two years to get us
permanent residency.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we finally can move to a cool
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just doing as little as they
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's great for corn,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally... Genetically modified corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, my program at Pioneer was
named Native Traits, like not using
[SPEAKER_05]: transgenics because it doesn't always make
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the genes are out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to pull them out of another
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's still... 90% of plant breeding
is still that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you hear is like the transgenic stuff
is still only a small part.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the pesticides that are the problem,
not the genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you put a gene in... They use them
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they use them together.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're bred to handle lots of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They control the disease and they control
the medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing I know from growing
soybeans in the greenhouse, it's not easy
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organically, you really have to control
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I grew we organically, but on a very
small scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had fans going to prevent the fungi
from taking hold and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm really excited to actually dive
into this now because I've been waiting
[SPEAKER_05]: two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's kind of like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an industry retread.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like when you guys... Josh and
Kelly, I love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love everything that you guys do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you say is so scientifically
right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so like you guys are even connected
with the scientific underpinning of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that you say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to go back to your
comment about industry again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I used to work some big bad chemical
company that I probably shouldn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: worked at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how I met this guy,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what brought us together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember what brought us together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar, music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry Garcia brought us together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have a champion soybean greeter
who said au revoir industry and jumping
[SPEAKER_03]: into the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just we need more people like me
and Scott, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: The truth of it is, of course,
because if you believe that cannabis can
[SPEAKER_08]: rejuvenate and revitalize and improve
everybody's life, well, that includes big
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get big industry involved with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully, it will improve all of their
lives, including the industry itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well said, Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Mark, honestly, you got to
wonder, was it Jerry Garcia that
[SPEAKER_00]: originally brought you guys together or
was it weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like often the first
conversation is, yeah, it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that brings it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is true that not only is it,
you know, remediating the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's remediating our minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so many of us are able to have
these conversations in depth and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to see all different parts of the wheel
because our mind has been remediated by
[SPEAKER_00]: this amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really awesome how mysterious
and unbelievable the ganja plant is and
[SPEAKER_11]: how many layers like you can't just
transgenic it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't just genetically, you can't just
know the heads and whatever the cryogen,
[SPEAKER_11]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so deep and so technical that the
greatest of minds are just wracking
[SPEAKER_11]: themselves over it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the plant's just like, give me some
sun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that conversation to go back to
Mark and the chief there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We could do a whole hash church on this
and invite some of the people from SEGRA
[SPEAKER_13]: that have built a molecular biology lab
and are also looking into doing that work.
[SPEAKER_13]: We could invite Kevin McKernan.
[SPEAKER_13]: We could invite Mowgli from, we could have
a really great conversation, have Sam of
[SPEAKER_13]: course.
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be a good like three to four
hour one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was even thinking, I don't know what
your seminar is, but you should definitely
[SPEAKER_13]: come do it on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have like, I have two seminars and
they both take about an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and one is, one is,
you know, basically what I did in soybean
[SPEAKER_05]: and it would really change.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a big breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but the same thing will work in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the differences, the second
seminar is about how cannabis is different
[SPEAKER_05]: from other crops and how that affects the
strategy.
[SPEAKER_13]: The tweaking, the tweaking of the IP.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like how you would tweak the IP that works
for soybeans to make it work with
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, cannabis is a lot easier
because of the fact that you can,
[SPEAKER_05]: once you have a plant you like,
you can just clone it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that easy in soybean.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you got to like inbreed it and
fix it for all the traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's, it's like an eight year
process, you know, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you got to test it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in soybean, it has to be better and
it has to be tested across like a hundred
[SPEAKER_05]: different environments or nobody's going
to buy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what you're talking about for a
four seed variety.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's one thing, but if you want a
four seed variety, it's even longer than
[SPEAKER_08]: eight years, probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you can do some, Sam knows this,
you can do some inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say that you got the F3?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we got to F4 and a few cases in F5,
but it really fucks up the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every negative or sensitive trait pops up
and it has absolutely no health,
[SPEAKER_08]: no vigor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in most cases it's functionally
sterile, which means the pollen,
[SPEAKER_08]: although it still can be transferred by
Q-tip to, it doesn't die yeast and it,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's sticky or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's impossible to breed with without
extra, extra care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so most soybean varieties,
even though they were supposedly inbred,
[SPEAKER_05]: they were F3 derived.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they still had a lot of segregation,
even, even though all the plants look the
[SPEAKER_05]: same.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably going to be the same
thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there'll be F2 derived, but you'll
select phenotypically so that it looks
[SPEAKER_05]: uniform, but you're never going to get it
genetically homozygous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would die before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you, are you familiar with Alan
Capular's work or AKA Mushroom?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got like the largest soybean
collection in the world and has done
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing amounts of work with the genome
and all different kinds of things with
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the world collection that I knew
that I used to use was at Champaign,
[SPEAKER_05]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had like 30,000 different accessions
and I've, I've tapped it several times,
[SPEAKER_05]: screened it for various traits and I
actually came up with some really cool,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like some wild soybeans that I
have a patent on a fartless soybean.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soybean that doesn't make you fart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fartless soybean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't give you gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just a mutant that didn't
produce stachios.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stachios is what makes you fart,
but it never really made it to the market
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was only worth to pig as pig
feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or chicken feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only worth 50 cents more bushel and
it costs 50 cents just to keep it
[SPEAKER_05]: separate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the identity preservation costs are 50
cents.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you lose all the value because you have
to keep it separate, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: keep it in separate elevators and da da da
da da.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like economics plays a big role in what
makes it the market, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how economics affects farting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, we don't really care if
the pigs fart.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's, if it's not worth more than 50
cents, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's methane with fartless beans though.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's screwing up the atmosphere
of methane.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's way worse than CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's like 10 times worse than
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out faded.
[SPEAKER_13]: Faded AF who said that gold, the avenue is
less methane with fartless beans.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty hilarious.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just funny that you, you just never
know what's going to come up in
[SPEAKER_13]: conversation on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, like cannabis is like,
is a plant breeder's dream because you're
[SPEAKER_05]: in the infancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's tons of variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, ah, it's like the coolest plant
to work on, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's medicine, it's food,
it's fiber, it's, it's good for the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unbelievable that day that it's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just can't, that shows you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the things you just said are exactly
why it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's all these people like us that
are just so passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it keeps us up at night,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, I gotta get, I gotta go to
a cool state, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 600 people or 560 people watching
right now just for us to talk about this
[SPEAKER_13]: very thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of people worldwide and it's
growing more and more and more as I see
[SPEAKER_13]: people developing a relationship outside
of that, that, that, that strip of
[SPEAKER_13]: prohibition that we all, you know,
the most passionate seem to be like,
[SPEAKER_13]: you really have to push through that
prohibition thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, so this is going to endanger my
life.
[SPEAKER_13]: My family, my freedom, my safety,
like all of these things, my, like,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a, it's a big thing to step through
that veil and, and, and sort of own all of
[SPEAKER_13]: that to be a cannabis person in the last
30, 40, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we're entering this new level
where I think there's some of the
[SPEAKER_13]: animosity comes from people from the,
from the community, the old school
[SPEAKER_13]: community, where they see these people
coming in that have not had to step
[SPEAKER_13]: through that veil.
[SPEAKER_13]: And personally, I say stop presenting
people for, for not having to step through
[SPEAKER_13]: that veil because that's the whole point
of our activism for the last 50 plus years
[SPEAKER_13]: was to remove that veil so that people
could step freely through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it doesn't matter if they haven't been
involved in the industry for 10 or 20 or
[SPEAKER_13]: 30 or 40 years, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can still come and, and put their hat
in the ring and, and, and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm excited to see that sort of
opening.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sort of like now instead of breeding
with like a hundred or a thousand,
[SPEAKER_13]: we're opening it up to the millions,
you know, to hundreds of thousands.
[SPEAKER_13]: The numbers are just so great that we're
going to pull some great people into this,
[SPEAKER_13]: into this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been criticized because I was
looking forward to the inclusion of
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means if somebody used to be a
prison guard and now they'd rather grow
[SPEAKER_08]: herb, so be it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, isn't it better for them to grow
herb than be a prison guard or a
[SPEAKER_08]: policeman?
[SPEAKER_13]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in the same agreeance.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also get criticized for it when
they're like, now they're coming in to
[SPEAKER_13]: take over the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, no, they're just coming in to
be a part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to let anyone take
anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're the ones that our own civil
disobedience is the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we're so protective of our
baby, I guess, because civil disobedience
[SPEAKER_13]: that's opened up this avenue.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it's just a matter of maintaining some
proper stewards.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Hillary Black, she gets,
she gets people on her all the time
[SPEAKER_13]: because she works for Canopy and it's
like, I love having Hillary Black in the
[SPEAKER_13]: ear of Canopy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could not picture a better person to be
in the, you know, I heard recently Canopy
[SPEAKER_13]: is now bigger than like Air Canada and
WestJet combined.
[SPEAKER_13]: Two of our big airlines in Canada,
this is a cannabis company and they have
[SPEAKER_13]: Hillary Black in their ear.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have my money on Hillary over Canopy in
that conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: She's just too sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: She'll just infect them with sweetness and
her, her positivity.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the way she's always been a real
proper stewardess of the plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, of the highest integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that we've brought it
this far to not educate people on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that it's totally
important that new people are coming and
[SPEAKER_00]: being involved, but I think that we can
take all of what we've learned in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years and bring it forward to,
to make it more, you know, viable for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to go forward and have success.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope it would be more respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to a lot of conferences and I went to
one last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe look down on the pioneers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sitting next to a table of people
talking and I overheard them say,
[SPEAKER_04]: wow, you're a true pioneer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been in the industry for four
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, I had to speak up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hold on a minute now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been people doing this 40,
50 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are dedicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends went to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: They died.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also you would have the honor of doing
this and you don't know me or you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know any of these people and what they've
done, you know, before you throw a broad
[SPEAKER_04]: spectrum, you know, uh, this on our whole
community and all the people that got you
[SPEAKER_04]: here, you know, let's step back and you
should respect this a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's a two edged sword out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't, you know, I'm open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all the science that's come into
the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, you know, raises the bar and
puts it into a whole nother international
[SPEAKER_04]: level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that part, but, uh, just a little
respect from some people towards the
[SPEAKER_04]: pioneers would be highly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_13]: That goes back to perspective.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of when you hear like a 14 year
old kid said, remember back in the day,
[SPEAKER_13]: and that was like three years ago,
because that's what his perspective is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and it's a perfect example of even
how you framed it was like your friends
[SPEAKER_13]: went to jail, your friends died.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's still a very small
perspective.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you go back some centuries to people
that were being flogged and murdered and
[SPEAKER_13]: killed over this plant, this has been
happening for so much longer than any of
[SPEAKER_13]: us have been alive.
[SPEAKER_13]: That it's, it's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like this, this prohibition of cannabis
goes back way beyond our friends and
[SPEAKER_13]: family way beyond 40 or 50 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes far back for these countries to
produce these plants, these Sufis to have
[SPEAKER_13]: gone through the torture that they went
through for eating hashish.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like all of these different histories.
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be great to have Chris Bennett in
the room right now, cause he'd bust out an
[SPEAKER_13]: accurate description of all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, those guys are also a part
of that pioneering that maybe we don't
[SPEAKER_13]: give credit to enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now we can easily see why maybe the
next group isn't giving credit easily
[SPEAKER_13]: enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about our perspective and how
it's framed in the timeline that we've
[SPEAKER_13]: existed in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I, I agree with you on one level.
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the other level, I just see it as a
natural cycle of humans that we ourselves,
[SPEAKER_13]: as the apparent pioneers in this
particular 40 to 50 year run are maybe
[SPEAKER_13]: also forgetting the last 50 before us and
the hundred years before that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the, you know, these cultivars too,
they've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_13]: These plants, these, these are not
yesterday's plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: People have only been smoking cannabis for
about 500 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before that, because smoking is a new
world invention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis was an old world invention.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Columbus had to mix the two up before.
[SPEAKER_08]: We started smoking, but there was
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was prohibition in the eating of
cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: The garden of copper in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think it was 1350 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you said, if they caught you,
they would give you rotten milk,
[SPEAKER_08]: make you drink it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you threw up green for eating
hashish, then they pulled your teeth out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's, there's 5,000
years, it goes back to Moxibustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis was used to burn in
Moxibustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in the old ancient
Chinese health texts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were burning it, then it was
all around the patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Scythians did that as well,
didn't they?
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't they one of the oldest?
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, I wish Chris was here because
he's just got such a great grasp on the
[SPEAKER_08]: Chinese maybe two or 3000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the Scythians, what they did was
they threw flowering cannabis on top of
[SPEAKER_08]: embers in a fire underneath the tent.
[SPEAKER_08]: They got in the tent with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And according to Herodotus, they screamed
with joy.
[SPEAKER_13]: The hot box.
[SPEAKER_13]: And right there, that's some old school
hot box and just a couple of thousand
[SPEAKER_13]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully, yes, we should always,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: And that also comes just with ignorance
when you don't know something,
[SPEAKER_13]: people saying, Oh, you're a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been in this industry for four
years, because I have to admit,
[SPEAKER_13]: Tom, I've heard that as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: But from my perspective, and I honestly,
my natural, natural reaction to it was
[SPEAKER_13]: that I chuckled.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't offended at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought like, Oh, it was just
funny, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's like, I know something they
don't.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't be mad at them because they
don't know they're just coming in with
[SPEAKER_13]: this really narrow slice of the pie.
[SPEAKER_13]: But potentially, and we all started
somewhere in 40 or 50 years, they could
[SPEAKER_13]: get to where a lot of us are and be in a
position to help educate the next round of
[SPEAKER_13]: young ignorant box.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone was really lucky.
[SPEAKER_08]: I happened to be there when cannabis was
invented in 1952.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys ever check out?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you ever check out?
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, not to, but I was just saying that I
think the industry, everything's just
[SPEAKER_11]: changing so fast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I think it's almost like a modern
issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, what do we even know about
two years ago?
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems like forever ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, on, on certain levels,
you know, it's like the pioneers,
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the 14 year olds do know
everything because all they have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: ask a question and they can Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we don't need elders
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's very symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, you have a
question, you can have it answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a really symptomatic
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are the roots that go all the
way down to that possible question?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a real issue with society today.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would say this is the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, two years ago, it was like a
revelation that you could get CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now it's a revelation that you just
take the THC out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, oh, you just have CBD
isolate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's a thing of the past.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_11]: No THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're so out of the loop.
[SPEAKER_11]: That thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, anyway, I think it's interesting
how fast things are changing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw your video about when you went to
Jamaica and you were looking for all the
[SPEAKER_05]: fields where you were doing selections and
you found that one field where everything
[SPEAKER_05]: looked more uniform and you were selecting
the female, the best females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you still have that seed?
[SPEAKER_13]: I have most of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I have seeds that go way back before
videos too from around 95, 96 in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was this other guy that I
talked to in Oregon and he got this stream
[SPEAKER_05]: from Africa called Malawi, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Malawi, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Malawi.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it was supposed to be the most
potent and the only problem is it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: late maturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he bought some seeds and he's breeding
it to be earlier, you know, earlier
[SPEAKER_05]: maturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess if you're growing indoors,
that doesn't matter, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pretty much do that with lights,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if you're just taking it to a tropical
place like Jamaica.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was really impressed with that video
because that's exactly what plant breeders
[SPEAKER_05]: do that are do native traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to a place like that and you just
start collecting stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that field of all those females that
you showed, that's what turned me on to
[SPEAKER_05]: plant breeding, just to see the genetic
diversity right in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those were slightly, those were
intermated, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were like a population.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they still had tons of diversity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Jamaica is this crazy inbred island
of cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard to find those pure, I don't want
to say land race because even they were
[SPEAKER_13]: brought there from most likely India.
[SPEAKER_13]: But some of those older narrow leaf drug
cultivars, those tall ones, that's what I
[SPEAKER_13]: was always looking for.
[SPEAKER_13]: But of course, most of what you end up
finding is these short stacked single
[SPEAKER_13]: buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep seven turtles.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were just talking about going
someplace and collecting teeth.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's called biopiracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there's enough diversity now,
I think, to keep us going for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would say three quarters of the
people out there was at least partially
[SPEAKER_08]: collected, but no, it's not collected.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is anybody collecting for disease
resistance?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's the next phase in cannabis
breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: People have not focused on it yet,
partly because of population sizes,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe you need for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also because it's a little bit more
sophisticated breeding than just breeding
[SPEAKER_08]: for...
[SPEAKER_13]: Just go into anyone's grow room and you
can see that people have not focused on
[SPEAKER_13]: disease resistant cultivars as of yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you have to go back to really
wild stuff to get it because the gene pool
[SPEAKER_05]: has been so bottlenecked.
[SPEAKER_08]: The exact opposite is what's actually
true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since the introduction of wide leaf drug
varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for... Actually, I know a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you select for just drug types,
that's what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, it's even different than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The narrow leaf, the equatorial,
tropical narrow leaf drug varieties,
[SPEAKER_08]: they have high resistance to mold and
powdery mildew and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas materials from Afghanistan up in
the mountains, they don't have any
[SPEAKER_08]: resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you bring them down to areas
where there are those problems,
[SPEAKER_08]: your plants and the hybrids of those
plants have serious, serious problems with
[SPEAKER_08]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we can really listen to the
plant and what it is that the genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: telling us and where the genetics have
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that lots of small time
growers for a very long time have been
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for pesticide, you know,
for pest issues and for fungi issues for a
[SPEAKER_00]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are small breeders out there that
have been doing it a super long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that that may not be like the
large industry big breeding, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of amazing varieties out there that
are totally resistant to pests and fungi.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going through maybe hundreds
of seeds, you know, in their field,
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe a thousand, and then they go through
and only pollinate the ones that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, look the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, who's going to go to a plant and
pollinate something with powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_11]: all over it?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, okay, so it happens, but that
person is not really working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that those years of
expertise that people have been doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in their small gardens does have
a play in the breeding industry moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just to give you a clue of what I
mean by diversity, in order to find some
[SPEAKER_05]: traits that I was looking for,
I screened like 15,000 different
[SPEAKER_05]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And found one that had the fartless trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so you have to make a commitment
if you want to do that breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm guessing the reason the narrow
leaf ones are more disease resistant to
[SPEAKER_05]: fungi is because air moves through the
canopy better.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that in soybean, you know,
like there's narrow leaf soybeans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's partly that and partly the
other thing is that they come from an
[SPEAKER_08]: environment that's wet, humid and hot and
wet and humid and hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they don't have natural resistance,
they're going to seem to exist as a
[SPEAKER_08]: variety.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Powdery mildew is actually pretty common
in a lot of resistance genes are not hard
[SPEAKER_05]: to find in a lot of crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about, I don't know about
cannabis yet because I never looked for
[SPEAKER_05]: it, but it should be easy to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's an obligate parasite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It evolved with the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can only live on that plant and maybe
one wild other, you know, so, so when,
[SPEAKER_05]: when you have a situation like that,
the host develops resistance genes very
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're, they're, they're out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got to look for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've grown thousands, thousands of
accessions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Afghan seeds that I imported from
Afghanistan many different times.
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me tell you in general,
they have zero resistance to powdery
[SPEAKER_08]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have, do they all have broad
leaves?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the narrow leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have one plant growing in the
middle of a whole bunch of narrowly
[SPEAKER_08]: plants, that one gets mildewy and all the
rest of them don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not density.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not, it's, I mean, what you're saying
is partly, but that's not the core reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: The core reason is they don't have any
genetic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think that we're seeing a
tremendous, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: non resistant and variety of different
types of leaf mildews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's real easy to say,
Oh, it's PM or Oh, it's DM, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a tremendous amount of different
types of mildews that are landing on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see it any different than
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see a Candida infection
exactly the same inside of a human as I
[SPEAKER_00]: would see on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing humans, you know,
much less of a, of a healthy microbiome in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same way that we're seeing unhealthy
microbiome and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with the toxicity,
whatever they're spraying up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere, whatever is going into our
soils, whatever is going into the,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the water systems is really,
you know, bringing down the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is something that,
you know, the reason why it's such a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, PM, PM, everybody that you
talk to in the industry is talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why it has to do with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with environment and it,
you know, and it has to do with the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're living right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing more and more people
affected in their microbiome, more soil
[SPEAKER_00]: affected in the microbiome and more plants
affected in the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be smarter than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to clean up our act and we have to
produce genetics that are immune to these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam, were you able to produce any soils or
any ways to enhance the immune system to
[SPEAKER_11]: create?
[SPEAKER_08]: Organic growing in general, biodynamic
organic growing in general does that
[SPEAKER_08]: really a lot, but I'd like to repeat that
if I'm growing huge amounts of narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_08]: plants, none of them are getting mildew.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grow a few of the Afghan ones in with
them and they all do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're like magnets for it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it does, you don't really have to
be a plant breeder to understand that one
[SPEAKER_13]: comes from a super dry arid area and has
never encountered powdery mildew before.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other is grown in the,
in the tropical, like super humid,
[SPEAKER_13]: super hot environment, like where,
where if you put an Afghan there,
[SPEAKER_13]: just go to Jamaica and see, they put those
Afghan and they just get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could say the same as somebody
who's been living up in Siberia their
[SPEAKER_00]: entire life and then bring them to the
tropics and what kind of things come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, you know, what their body is
totally used to, what their genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's, it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I do work in large clinics and in
tropical areas and a lot of the doctors or
[SPEAKER_00]: nurses or midwives that come down into
that area, they get really sick because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been dealing with like cold
environment for a long time and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: all different types of mildews and fungi
that will come out of them to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see us any different than the
plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: True that for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I definitely from traveling, I saw it a
lot, just people going to countries they'd
[SPEAKER_13]: never been too far off countries and
picking up weird viruses, weird little,
[SPEAKER_13]: little sicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all because of the microbiome
and how much it changes from region to
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that microbiome is, is inside of the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inside of the seed as much as it,
you know, is resistant or non-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: when it grows out into a plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, shit, two and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to call it a day.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's a, what's a, how's everyone
feeling?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say goodbye to Scott.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go check into my Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, the Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've texted Mark to put us in touch
with one another.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some more questions for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks a lot you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for coming and opening up the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we meet on the flip side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be about two or three months
before I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to sell my house and all that
stuff, but just be patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly reach out to me and I'll,
I'll put you in contact with Scott too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, I would love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much thought for coming on and
your inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you later chief.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I want to thank everyone for coming
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: D4 20 K and Johnny B the dragon fly earth
medicine crew, farmer, Tom, skunk man,
[SPEAKER_13]: Sam, Wade, laughter.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, Dr. Mark Sheldon and Scott
always a good conversation with everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did appreciate.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate not everyone agreeing on
everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the discourse, you know,
being able to have dialogue about
[SPEAKER_13]: different things and not get upset and
start calling each other names,
[SPEAKER_13]: but just have like an adult conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I wish actually Cuban would have
come back in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause when we started the organics talk,
he was talking a lot about how he does not
[SPEAKER_13]: do organics.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he just had his own good points that
would have made a, I just think it's okay
[SPEAKER_13]: for us to disagree.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's kind of the biggest value here
on hash church.
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, as you know, Josh was
saying, this industry is changing so fast
[SPEAKER_13]: month after month after month that it's
pretty important to have a dialogue going
[SPEAKER_13]: to let people kind of catch up and keep up
with what's going on in the changes that
[SPEAKER_13]: are so consistent.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to thank all of you for coming
out and sharing your time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course the people who are watching
and listening.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see you next Sunday if, if,
if I can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's great to hash it out with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scott looked like Michael Keaton.
[SPEAKER_13]: He definitely had a little Michael Keaton
thing going on for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just afraid to say it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a great Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace.
