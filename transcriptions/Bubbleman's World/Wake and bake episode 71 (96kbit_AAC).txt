got some giant huge monstrous head or some
[SPEAKER_00]: real super tiny small head Maybe it
wouldn't fit but in the meantime this was
[SPEAKER_00]: sent to me by the good folks at SNB

Vancouver with Chris Bennett no,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not fitted Octo Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally just showed the whole hat and
if you notice on The back I said that you

[SPEAKER_00]: crystal from the Himalayas Himalayan
Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tiny little hercimers like
hercimer diamonds Of course hercimers are
[SPEAKER_00]: called hercimers because they're from
hercimer, New York These are hercimer
[SPEAKER_00]: diamonds that were not found in hercimer,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a little double terminated
quartz crystals They're very small just a
[SPEAKER_00]: fun little kind of thing to see Send out,

get on this.

in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to ship them out of the
country and so probably not but If you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys want to know something in two more
episodes when we hit episode 73 I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be giving away a set of bubble bags.

chasola there I Love the method of dumping
[SPEAKER_00]: the the cleaner in Like this and you see
it foaming up pop And then the bowl just
[SPEAKER_00]: cleans so nice afterwards cleaning out the
chas That was a good rep a little bit hot
[SPEAKER_00]: but She cleaned real nice Always happy
when she cleans real nice Get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a tiny little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can't get a little liquid
on there So I hope everyone is doing well
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on the outside interesting every
once in a while when you do that method
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do it pushes everything out onto
the outside So when you can't quite get it
[SPEAKER_00]: clean You can go to the outside because a

[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to hear Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a nice day when you're
making bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to make some bubble today Oh,
I'm glad you did stray J.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alright, the website's still locked up
You can go to bubble man brand Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: account for updates I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could tell you everything that's
happening with that a lot of stuff going
[SPEAKER_00]: on right now between our Jamaican projects
between California between Canada and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron and greenhouse project I got so much
going on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know really where to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So What should we talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: today Live stream making bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an idea for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do it I also like the idea of
really filming a nice nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gonna film a really really
clean Proper lab hash wash down in
[SPEAKER_00]: California here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have my voiceover But it'll be
Tony's or one of our workers hands that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be seeing doing all the things It's
taking a month a month in a bit to really
[SPEAKER_00]: get the SOPs rolling and teach everyone
exactly how I do it because there are so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different things that you can do in
making bubble so many little things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can change that It took a while to
explain exactly how I wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tony and I have been doing a lot of
FaceTime hash making over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: the last couple of months It's been pretty
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boats great the boats down on the on
the on the trailer in my front yard right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and I'll probably Maybe put it in the
water today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a check to see that the battery is
working I kept it trickle charged all
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, but I want to make sure that it's
that it's good So I'm gonna put the
[SPEAKER_00]: battery in today Get that checked out now
The one thing I had was a little bit tight
[SPEAKER_00]: on my cable for my gas and I wasn't quite
sure what's up with that My mechanic said
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a little bit from moisture
over the winter It might release and it
[SPEAKER_00]: might get tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically said take it out for the
weekend if it does get tighter then I got
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove that wire that cable and replace
it not the end of the world by any means
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely a time waster and a money
waster, you know how it goes break out
[SPEAKER_00]: another ten grand That's what boat stands
for not break out another thousand break
[SPEAKER_00]: out another ten grand That's what boat
stands for we have to change with
[SPEAKER_00]: inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they said that about boats 25 years
ago But let's be honest today if you only
[SPEAKER_00]: have to break out a grand for your boat
Wow, you're lucky Boats and hoes boats and
[SPEAKER_00]: hoes Yeah, that was some classic from
stepbrothers the video that those two guys
[SPEAKER_00]: filmed on the video on the on the sailboat
classic Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I blew my motor right out of my boat
a couple I think it was last year So the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the year before last year and so
that was quite expensive, but insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: covered it It was a faulty piece in the
motor that broke Yeah, I agree Amelia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to really love filming videos up
close with my macro of Bubbling resin and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was something that you know back in the
day when I first started doing it There
[SPEAKER_00]: was nowhere else I could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no website or any Instagram or
anything I could just go look at bubbling
[SPEAKER_00]: melting resin and so I felt Kind of in my
own little world, you know for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started my macro photographs Not
too many people were doing it especially
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis space a lot of people were
doing it in the bug and Flower space,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the macro world is full of
people who shoot bugs insects and flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I learned a lot of my
information some really helpful awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't have any egos don't have any
competition are super eager and happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: share everything they learn about
photography and really that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: attitude that I brought into it the
cannabis industry the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: a funny industry because you know People
want to share but people also want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hoard And sometimes the hoarding is more
Attuned to promoting their personal agenda
[SPEAKER_00]: ie making profit, you know Like if I don't
show anyone how to do this and I'm the
[SPEAKER_00]: only one that can do it Well, then
everyone has to come to me to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for instance some people called
me the other day from California They saw
[SPEAKER_00]: my photography They really wanted to hire
me, you know I get fifteen hundred to two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars a day when I shoot so it
would be of value to be flown down to
[SPEAKER_00]: California and and shoot for two or three
days in a big facility and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, but I Cannot go down to
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, I will turn this gentleman
on to a couple of my friends I will turn
[SPEAKER_00]: them on to say dynasty who I think is one
of the best macro photographers going
[SPEAKER_00]: right now Hands down hands down and he's
in Oregon and I also told him another
[SPEAKER_00]: great photographer friend of mine who's
right in California is Todd McCormick who
[SPEAKER_00]: also has the same lens and shoots really
great Shots does the stacks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah shale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is in like see I don't think
he's in California There's all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: great photographers, but the key is where
are you if you're gonna be hired for this
[SPEAKER_00]: job?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're close octo Tom They're close fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Chris Rex is the fucking man
professor P for prez.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Nicholas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right All right, but when I'm going to
email you one of the best photographers
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following All right can a guy no
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow a lot of Great photographers and
I'm always happy to follow more Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sucks straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I would do bad things in
America I try to be a good influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be good and I don't know And now
for some reason they have become illegal I
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard that they're illegal at all
David at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of the companies That
were selling terpenes also started selling
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD isolate and that for sure is not legal
Particularly if you're shipping it around
[SPEAKER_00]: state lines Who are some of the artists
you are inspired by well, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: artists, you know I like for psychedelic
visionary artists Luke Brown Robert Venosa
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Gray psychedelic visionary artists
for glass-blowing artists, of course
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcel and the depi mothership crew and
Jason Lee and You know slinger Dosa
[SPEAKER_00]: endless amounts and in you know Music
well, I love a whole variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: John genres of music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of reggae music Photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like a whole variety of
photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pot photographers that inspire me
many of which we have already named here
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the backcountry big mountain
photographers that inspired me were Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: Berger Blake Jorgensen Paul Morrison all
from Whistler all incredible photographers
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan Manley Who is now a videographer
for Arc'teryx but has taken some
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely stunning images?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's this is the guy that took the image
He went up to Whistler and he set up his
[SPEAKER_00]: camera on a tripod And it was a macro shot
and he brought a little bit of water with
[SPEAKER_00]: a dropper Funny that I would have one
right here a little dropper and he went
[SPEAKER_00]: over to a leaf and he set up the shot
Where he put his bike and he got his
[SPEAKER_00]: camera and he looked into the water He put
a droplet of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked into the water droplet And he I
don't know where he marked or if he parked
[SPEAKER_00]: his bike there But he kept moving his bike
into the point where it was like and
[SPEAKER_00]: moving his camera to the point where okay
Everything's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he marked that spot and he had a
little photographer, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little auto click for taking the
picture on his bike a wireless one and so
[SPEAKER_00]: he set the whole camera up the little
water droplet this was like a very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult like impossible shot from a
macro standpoint when you take when you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the shot and I'll insist that you go
look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, maybe I'll even try to bring it
up because holy shit What he did was
[SPEAKER_00]: everything got set up and then he I Wonder
if I'm gonna be able to find it too
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was pretty sure Okay,
here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is it so he takes this this
water droplet he creates a refraction shot
[SPEAKER_00]: and He wants to be on his mountain bike
Okay Under in the water drop usually you
[SPEAKER_00]: show up upside down because it's a
refraction Well a fly came along at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very same time that he was driving his
bike and this fly Started drinking one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here he is upside down on his
mountain bike Can you imagine the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of that macro shot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the guy is so inspiring when I asked
him I took a course with him actually Up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Whistler for bit for probe skiing and
mountain biking and I said, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: What's one of the kind of a cool tip that
you could give me and he said well If you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get shots that nobody else gets
Put your camera where nobody puts their
[SPEAKER_00]: camera and at first I was kind of like
what and he's like Well, you know how a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people kind of take their they we
used to take pictures with like this This
[SPEAKER_00]: is how all pictures were taken Well,
then the phones came out and we started
[SPEAKER_00]: taking pictures from The back screens live
view of cameras and now there are ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can set up shots We can put our
cameras anywhere and when you put your
[SPEAKER_00]: camera somewhere that no one else has put
their camera You will end up getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: shot that no one else in the world has
gotten and I took him to his word on that
[SPEAKER_00]: and when he told me that I applied that to
my own cannabis photography and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: part of you know, my macro photography is
is that I don't claim to be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis macro photographer out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there are some exceptional
photographers that are Above my my level
[SPEAKER_00]: of talent or or skill, but what I would
say is that I definitely helped Popularize
[SPEAKER_00]: and take some of these first shots,
you know from certain angles certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things that just had never Existed the
shots never existed in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think I had never seen macro
photographs of beautiful amber perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: cured bubble or dry sift, you know when I
took those shots of Sam the skunk man's
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift heads that was Something that I
had never I had never seen before no one
[SPEAKER_00]: had ever seen it because when I posted it
It immediately became almost viral
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of people saw the
those particular early shots I think it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time for a rip Martin Olson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we do that bong rip?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been fun being a part of it,
you know And I'm always happy to shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that inspired me and came
before me because there were a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know drew I was a Step in the in
the in the ladder, you know, because let's
[SPEAKER_00]: be honest I was inspired by people who
were the steps before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to stand on the shoulders of Giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you look at If you're lucky
enough to stand on the shoulders of diet
[SPEAKER_00]: Giants, you should be humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always approach your Your your
journey in life with humility,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Humility is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I learn about everything in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I want to be a humble person It
pays off and I don't pretend to be humble
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred percent of the time I'm
definitely a little bit aggressive when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm driving in my vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting mad and yelling at the people
in front of me But what can you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am human Hey, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why you're tipping me,
but I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't keep it for myself Just doesn't
seem right, especially when people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going through all sorts of different
problems in our community I love being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to turn this instead of something for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much traction can I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much monetary gain can I make how
much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Followers can I get I like turning this
channel into Something that's bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what hash church was all about and
that's why the giveaways on the wake and
[SPEAKER_00]: bakes And that's why we're donating any
money that comes in and very transparent
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
