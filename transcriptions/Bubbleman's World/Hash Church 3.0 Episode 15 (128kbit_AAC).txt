[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I think we are pretty much live
here, just setting up the meeting on
[SPEAKER_17]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_17]: A second or so, just so I, yes,
okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're here.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome everyone to Hash Church,
episode 15 of Hash Church 3.0.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just gonna copy the link.
[SPEAKER_17]: I am not sure who's gonna show up today.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really sent this out last minute and I
thought, you know what, even if nobody
[SPEAKER_17]: sends ships out, I'm good to go and I'll
do a little Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had Johnny B say he might come in and I
had Colin mention that he might come in.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, Etienne Fontaine is always
gonna come in because he's our guy that's
[SPEAKER_17]: always here.
[SPEAKER_17]: There he is right there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me fix my audio so I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I suspect it's my problem, not yours.
[SPEAKER_17]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_17]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had, when I come on, often Zoom,
it will take my raspberry microphone,
[SPEAKER_17]: this little guy, and it'll also make it my
speaker.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't even glitch anymore when that
happens.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, you know what, I know what's
going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing happens to me sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you switch over, it just decides that
everything's gonna be, your mic is now
[SPEAKER_03]: your audio.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will be honest, I have been,
not to start so, so, so, so early,
[SPEAKER_17]: I wonder who dig on Mo QHSRs, who that's
gonna be.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good morning, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: And who else do we got in the room there?
[SPEAKER_17]: You gotta unmute yourself and turn on your
camera because we can't see you.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't see you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Mr. West.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that Hank?
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that Hank West?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we don't got you yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: No audio.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can see you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone told me in chat today,
they were like, invite Mike West.
[SPEAKER_17]: He said he would come in.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_17]: I always feel bad inviting Mike West
because I know he likes to share.
[SPEAKER_17]: At the same time, I know he likes to relax
and enjoy himself and spend some time with
[SPEAKER_17]: his, with his wonderful wife.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, Dr. Allison.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: Be honest, did we pull you away from
Clubhouse?
[SPEAKER_15]: You totally did.
[SPEAKER_15]: You totally did.
[SPEAKER_15]: Knew it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have new boundaries now on Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, during our family time,
you know, like dinner time and post dinner
[SPEAKER_15]: time, it's very limited.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I was just, I'm becoming obsessed
with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, for those of you that don't know
that we know that we are starting.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just see here.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think they understand.
[SPEAKER_17]: They got to go into the next link for
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure we're all good
here and that we're actually live because
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see people coming in to the other
chat.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, let me see what I did here.
[SPEAKER_17]: I probably made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, look, there's Mike West.
[SPEAKER_17]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't seen your face.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to see your face.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why the chat's not working on
YouTube, but we'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I will also say, yeah, it says chat's not
working on the new stream.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really kind of a problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wonder why the chat's not working.
[SPEAKER_17]: The chat's not working on the new stream.
Ouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's starting to appear now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep cleansing, cannabis laden breath.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was scary.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I want to start with today,
because it really is kind of a big deal,
[SPEAKER_17]: especially for just this whole,
not just the cannabis conversation and the
[SPEAKER_17]: psychedelic dialogue and all these
different dialogues that we all know are
[SPEAKER_17]: super important to have right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: But recently I got turned on to this app
that we were just talking about called
[SPEAKER_17]: Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was actually Steven who turned me on
and then Dr. Allison gave me a bunch of
[SPEAKER_17]: tips and tricks for it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it truly is a phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's a double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's both a phenomenal app and it will
literally steal all your time for you if
[SPEAKER_17]: you let it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the way I look at this app is it seems
like it's like hash church.
[SPEAKER_17]: Times like 10,000, like there's just
10,000 hash church rooms going.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, the only difference from a hash
church to a clubhouse, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_17]: is that it's not recorded.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't go back and save it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't go back and listen to it,
which is definitely somewhat of a problem,
[SPEAKER_17]: but also.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Marcus, actually, you can record it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You are able to record them.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just have to put it in the topic
section.
[SPEAKER_15]: That you're recording it and then you can
record it on your own and then share it,
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess, through other like your podcast
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, a lot of people are doing that.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, well, that's amazing because to not be
able to save it, I thought was a little
[SPEAKER_17]: bit of a downer.
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, it seemed to create
unique conversation that I just can't
[SPEAKER_17]: really say enough about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's super trippy.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an invite only app.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not available to Android.
[SPEAKER_17]: It is available to iPhone users.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to make it available to
Android users eventually.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would get on it, figure it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to have a presence over there at
10 and Allison and Mike and a ton of
[SPEAKER_17]: people are over there already.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really dynamic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, it's definitely pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_17]: The different rooms that you can go into
based on even started.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a there's a German cannabis room I
was in earlier today.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't understand an entire word they
said, but they were just talking about
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis in German.
[SPEAKER_17]: That is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm really stoked on the app.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely unique.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the fact that it takes the video
out of the, you know, the sort of people
[SPEAKER_17]: are really eager to share when that video
isn't there, when it's less exposed,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's a little bit more private.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just a voice.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, it's how can we get an invite?
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that is a thing I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: I would ask around if you go on and you go
and reserve your name it should show you
[SPEAKER_17]: who in your contacts are on clubhouse and
you could potentially hit them up in a
[SPEAKER_17]: private message and say, hey, do you have
a clubhouse invite for me?
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be, you know, potentially one
way of getting it done.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had Stephen send me an invitation
and then I used my two.
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing about those invitations is if
you send them out to the wrong people,
[SPEAKER_17]: if you send them out to people on androids
or you accidentally send it to an iPad
[SPEAKER_17]: instead of the actual phone, the invites
are gone.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is a little bit rough in that sense
that it's very easy to blow your
[SPEAKER_17]: invitations and you only get a couple.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to interrupt you real quick.
[SPEAKER_15]: The more that you talk and the more that
you moderate, the more invites you get.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did get three more after my initial two,
but I've given them all away.
[SPEAKER_17]: Three of them were like Matt Stang ones
where they were just pooched.
[SPEAKER_17]: I accidentally gave them to people who I
don't even know if their phone number is
[SPEAKER_17]: the same phone number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an invite for you if you want to
give it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing this morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the chat room doing with Mark?
[SPEAKER_17]: Doing better with Mr. Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's about to be doing better.
[SPEAKER_17]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't you guys all feel better now that
Wade's here?
[SPEAKER_17]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_17]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like a calming energy.
[SPEAKER_17]: He brings laughter.
[SPEAKER_13]: He brings laughter.
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, Dr. Mark, we're also happy that
you're here too, because you bring
[SPEAKER_17]: information and it goes so well with
laughter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, I'm still not getting the group
message that you're sending out to people.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really strange.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think somehow you got bumped out of that
group.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to try and add you.
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_17]: Forever now, I'm just going to send you
your own invitation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Sam, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: You get your own private invitation.
[SPEAKER_17]: You've earned it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And nice to see the group.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't sure who was going to pop in
today.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was so last minute.
[SPEAKER_17]: But you guys are always good with your
time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Once again, I'm not going to go too,
too much on Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you guys aren't on it, if you can
figure out a way to get on it,
[SPEAKER_17]: if there's people on this panel that have
an iPhone and want to get an invitation.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, Mark, you would absolutely crush
Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's been times where I've wanted to
ping you into the room where people have
[SPEAKER_17]: been going off on sort of science.
[SPEAKER_13]: What exactly is it?
[SPEAKER_13]: I just joined.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I missed something.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is Clubhouse?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Clubhouse is just an app.
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me, it feels like an app that's
really turning the corner.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a Twitter.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a Facebook.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not about getting likes.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not about posting pictures.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just audio.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go into all these different rooms.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was in a room the other day with,
well, it's just been an incredible
[SPEAKER_17]: experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: Tons of amazing people.
[SPEAKER_17]: I even ended up in a room with Todd
McCormick the other day on a panel where
[SPEAKER_17]: we were both speaking.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_17]: I kept my mouth quiet because I knew the
last time I went into a room that he was
[SPEAKER_17]: in, he left right away and I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like there's conversations going on and
dialogues taking place that you absolutely
[SPEAKER_17]: can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_17]: The psychedelic mushroom one blew me away.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was amazed at how diverse the group of
people in the rooms were.
[SPEAKER_17]: Tons of people from America that are just
like, what's going on with these
[SPEAKER_17]: psychedelic mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_17]: Tons of great knowledge and shares going
on in that sort of area and just really
[SPEAKER_17]: unique conversations.
[SPEAKER_17]: Think Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_17]: More diverse.
[SPEAKER_17]: More diverse.
[SPEAKER_17]: More diverse.
[SPEAKER_17]: You think Hash Church in the sense of
joining together with 10 or 15 people and
[SPEAKER_17]: having a conversation, but it's just an
endless group of people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine if in the chat room right now in
YouTube, if I could just click on a name
[SPEAKER_17]: and bring them right up into here,
because that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got like 10 or 20 people on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got another 50 to 100 that are coming
into the room and leaving and coming.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if one of those people come in that
you want to hear, you just right click
[SPEAKER_17]: their name.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're the moderator, you invite to
speak.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now that person is up on the panel and
it's pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_17]: People are pretty good in regards to
keeping their mics muted when they're not
[SPEAKER_17]: talking.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's just super, super diverse in the
sense of, I mean, my goodness,
[SPEAKER_17]: were you in that room the other day?
[SPEAKER_17]: With the Nigerian princess, Dr. Allison?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing is there's different ways
that you can connect with people.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, like you can't message in the
actual app itself, which is kind of cool
[SPEAKER_15]: because there's no back messaging during
the conversation, but you can connect your
[SPEAKER_15]: Instagram and they can DM you and you can
follow people and engage with them that
[SPEAKER_15]: way.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very much like an immediate audio
connection.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the most fascinating things,
I would just told those two.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not only subject matter experts.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're just regular folks can
join the discussion without knowing much
[SPEAKER_13]: of anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of three levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the speakers at the top,
which are the moderator slash speakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got a second section that are
those that are followed by the speakers,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are not on the stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have the general audience at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The moderators up top can bring anybody up
from any level and there's a raise hand
[SPEAKER_03]: function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody has a question,
you allow them to raise hand and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: can bring them up, ask them the question,
then dismiss them off the dais or keep
[SPEAKER_03]: them up there to have further
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great way to absorb information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because you're not on video,
you can just listen to it on the side.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's the platform.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it a public company?
[SPEAKER_13]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I've heard a bunch about these guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not super good things.
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely heard a couple of bad things
when I first did some research.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I saw the other day they had
like a billion dollar valuation on this
[SPEAKER_17]: app.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's I think it's been around for a
while, like since April.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it seems to have only just caught my
attention here in the last week or so.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's I kind of can't say.
[SPEAKER_17]: Enough about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very addicting and it's very unique
to just be able to it's nice for me to go
[SPEAKER_17]: into rooms and just listen, not be invited
up, not have anyone know me at all and
[SPEAKER_17]: just listen and just be like, wow,
OK, this is actually really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've got to make their money like
what's their business models?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, data, I would suspect,
like all of these companies, how they all
[SPEAKER_13]: make their money, it's all through data
and so there's got to be some you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: you got to follow the money with these
things, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, don't they own the content like
when you so kind of like no more than
[SPEAKER_17]: YouTube, no more than Instagram,
no more than like it's pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the lawyers, the sharks that wrote
that stuff up years ago, it's now just
[SPEAKER_17]: getting regurgitated into new versions.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would be certain that just like
Instagram, everything you post belongs to
[SPEAKER_17]: them kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But well, not not wanting to bring
politics into discussion, but I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: wondering if if like, you know,
like the way that they ended Parler or the
[SPEAKER_13]: way that they took away the the the what
the hosting service of Parler,
[SPEAKER_13]: could this be a way again for hate groups
to sort of assemble or do they police that
[SPEAKER_02]: in any way or that's that's a great
question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, no, they do.
[SPEAKER_15]: They do.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can block people and report people.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have found that people are very kind to
each other.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when someone like a troll comes in,
they are blocked and kicked out
[SPEAKER_15]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there is a reporting feature.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I don't know the ins and outs of
parlor because that's just not my game.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know, there there is a reporting
feature and it's been everyone has been
[SPEAKER_15]: very kind and we kind of police each
other.
[SPEAKER_17]: I found that also the people have been
absolutely like really kind, like really
[SPEAKER_17]: really like respectful.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've only really had one experience in a
room where the wrong person got made into
[SPEAKER_17]: a moderator.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you kind of got to be careful about
that because that person can kick you out
[SPEAKER_17]: of your own room.
[SPEAKER_17]: They could kick every moderator out of the
room and basically take over your room.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that I experienced once already,
not a guy taking over a room, but one of
[SPEAKER_17]: 20 moderators just, you know, cutting it.
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, it was an incredible conversation
because it was it started about men
[SPEAKER_17]: cutting women off.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, you know, she was talking,
she got interrupted.
[SPEAKER_17]: She said, you know, I get this happens to
me all the time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Men cut me off and it's a real problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to mention it right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to have a discussion.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it kind of took a turn because
another woman came in and said,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, like I would like to share a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she was like, you know, some people
have OCD.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people have dyslexia.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people have all these little tweaks
with their personalities.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're using this app because they want
to come in and interact, but they have
[SPEAKER_17]: these tweaks and ticks of their
personalities.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she was kind of saying she was one of
those people.
[SPEAKER_17]: She tends to cut people off.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so she came in with this really
different, unique perspective.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other girl was like,
no, I'm not buying it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm I I'm owning this.
[SPEAKER_17]: He was cutting me off.
[SPEAKER_17]: The guy had already apologized,
but it was still and it reminded me of
[SPEAKER_17]: Hashchurch.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like many times there's been many men cut
many men off as well as many women off.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think it's just because we get
excited.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wade can shake his head because he's
literally the only one that has never done
[SPEAKER_17]: it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we've done it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've all done it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we talk louder and we try to get our
point across.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this discussion started and the
girls like, I'm not having it like I he
[SPEAKER_17]: cut me off.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then one of the moderators from the
room bounced her out of the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it became a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I actually listened for about 40
minutes and it was awkward and it was
[SPEAKER_17]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I felt like there was value in that
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_17]: Having that dialogue and like sitting
through these cringe, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: worthy moments that that were occurring.
[SPEAKER_17]: But as as a man, I felt like it was a
learning experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I I definitely saw both perspectives
of both of these girls.
[SPEAKER_17]: But you'll find all sorts of things like
that on Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a hey, Marcus, you go back to the
Nigerian when the situation where like the
[SPEAKER_15]: Nigerian came in and like had no idea and
was just asking questions.
[SPEAKER_17]: I went into I just went into her room.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't remember that exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just she had a room and I was like,
I'm just I went, you know, any time I
[SPEAKER_17]: think I went into a room that what's her
name now, Justine Bateman, Jason Bateman's
[SPEAKER_17]: sister.
[SPEAKER_17]: She was in a room talking about movies.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, I used to watch that girl on
TV when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go listen to her for a bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was in one of the games rooms the
other day talking about like, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: social equity and social justice and,
you know, basically making space for for
[SPEAKER_17]: brown and black people to be a part of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's just been a lot of,
you know, kind of unique people that you
[SPEAKER_17]: wouldn't normally have access to.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't do too much of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mostly I hit rooms that I see Dr. Allison
in, in psychedelic conversations or
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis conversations.
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are the ones that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, Mike West came in the other day
when we were talking about CO2 and
[SPEAKER_17]: released like an hour and a half long.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it was that was.
[SPEAKER_17]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_17]: No one was talking.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone was just like, all right,
let's just, well, but you had that,
[SPEAKER_15]: you had that kid that thought he knew
everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you brought Mike in and Mike
went, blew him away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was in a room the other day
where some guy came in and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys are talking about drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that was amazing because we were
talking about the difficulty of
[SPEAKER_17]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when we get into a psychedelic
experience where it's a bad trip and
[SPEAKER_17]: people were like, well, it's not really
bad.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about working those particular
muscles.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it feels rough because it's hard when
you're working things out, but you end up
[SPEAKER_17]: getting out the other side.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this African guy came in and he was
like, you are speaking about drugs.
[SPEAKER_17]: You, you are smoking drugs.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he was really loud and people were
kind of jumped all over him and got real
[SPEAKER_17]: negative.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, I don't know if you remember this
said to him, but I sort of said to
[SPEAKER_17]: everyone, I said, Hey, listen,
you know, like here we are talking about
[SPEAKER_17]: how to deal with bad trips.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then one potentially comes into our
actual reality in this moment.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is how we deal with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause people were really jumping on that
guy to kind of bounce.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get him out.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a troll.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, well, maybe he's a troll,
but maybe he's just a guy from Africa who
[SPEAKER_17]: has a cultural difference, who wants to
interact with us.
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe we could be a little bit more
patient.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, I found that funny as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let him start his own room, the anti-drug
room.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you doing, Sam?
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm alive a few minutes late, but I'm
here.
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a really big conversation
yesterday in one of the rooms.
[SPEAKER_17]: Donnie Werschafter was there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dale Hunt was there.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were talking about patents and IP in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was an entire conversation about GW
pharmaceuticals and canopy growth,
[SPEAKER_17]: suing GW.
[SPEAKER_17]: W pharmaceuticals because of the CO2
patent that they acquired that runs out in
[SPEAKER_17]: about a year.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was also a very interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_17]: I hadn't heard from, from Donnie
Werschafter in a very long time.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was neat to kind of hear him up on
the, on the stage, talking about these
[SPEAKER_17]: things.
[SPEAKER_17]: He obviously has a fairly in-depth
perspective of such things, but I was
[SPEAKER_17]: thinking about you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Donnie is a lawyer, but he also has
narcolepsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So while you're talking to him,
he'll fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had that happen many times with
Donnie as I've known him for, geez,
[SPEAKER_17]: about 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's one of the people that goes back
very, very far.
[SPEAKER_17]: He thought we went back to 96 yesterday,
but it's actually more like 94,
[SPEAKER_17]: 95 when I actually first met Mr.
Werschafter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Donnie had a lot of influence because his
uncle was the famous progressive insurance
[SPEAKER_06]: company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crap, I can't remember his name right now,
but he, he put in millions for marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peter Lewis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good old Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I visited with him, it was in
Amsterdam on his boat, which at the time
[SPEAKER_06]: was the 10th largest private boat in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Donnie was also one of the original
hamsters.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the Ohio Hempery and was importing
hemp seed oil and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when I was working for Ecolution,
we used to work on imports, exports and
[SPEAKER_03]: trading wholesale stuff like that back in
the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how we met him.
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically through hemp.
[SPEAKER_17]: He came out to Manitoba and we threw this
big hemp kind of conference pageant almost
[SPEAKER_17]: like a hemp pageant.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we brought the, the, the harvester
from Holland and we had the big scissor
[SPEAKER_17]: cut and we had the acreage going on.
[SPEAKER_17]: This was like in the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were trying to get live seed at the
time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, you could buy hemp seed from
China that was sterilized and dead and put
[SPEAKER_17]: it into hemp seed food and promote it as a
health thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: But really there was nothing left alive.
[SPEAKER_17]: In it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_17]: The embryos had just been steamed to death
before they could ship out of China.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was about $800 a ton.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you wanted to bring living seed to
actually plant, and it was like certified
[SPEAKER_17]: seed and registered in Canada,
that was the Zola Tenosha that we were
[SPEAKER_17]: getting out of the Ukraine, the 11th,
the 13th and the 15th.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, obviously Sam could probably go on
for hours about the different varieties of
[SPEAKER_17]: hemp because there was the Finola that he
had things to do with, and there were many
[SPEAKER_17]: other varieties from different countries.
[SPEAKER_17]: In Europe, but we, here we are at the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having this event.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got a whole room full of farmers and
we've brought our Zola Tenosha in and it's
[SPEAKER_17]: not cheap.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like 3000 bucks a ton or something
that these Ukrainian guys wanted for the
[SPEAKER_17]: seed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, it was viable.
[SPEAKER_17]: We figured no problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll make it work.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we bought all this seed.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we bought about I want to say 10
tons.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we brought that over and we were
trying to sell it to farmers and Donnie,
[SPEAKER_17]: we invited Donnie to our event and we're
up on the podium and my partner's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: listen, if any of you guys want to get
some hemp seed, we have some hemp seed
[SPEAKER_17]: we're selling for like, I think we were
trying to get like 3,500 bucks for it or
[SPEAKER_17]: maybe 4,000, you know, try to make a
thousand bucks off each ton that we sold.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Donnie Werschafter pushes his way up
to the podium and kind of is like,
[SPEAKER_17]: listen, I don't know what these crazy kids
are talking about, but I can get you a
[SPEAKER_17]: hemp seed out of China for $800 a ton.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't worry about these crazy prices these
kids are talking about.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're just like, what are you doing
Donnie?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll never forget that moment.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we actually laughed about it with him
later.
[SPEAKER_17]: He was just like, oh geez guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Smoking a joint with him afterwards.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we were the young guys and Donnie was
one of the elders that we looked up to,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, that was just like, Donnie's
going to do us right.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we just, you know, got done dirty
there for about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_17]: Every farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to mention too that I had
more than a little bit to do with Finola.
[SPEAKER_06]: I created Finola.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's what I was going to say,
but I figured I'd let you say it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You did breed Finola.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an expert at breaking in when I'm not
needed.
[SPEAKER_17]: We love you for it.
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, if you don't mind, could you just
only talk when Dr. Allison is talking and
[SPEAKER_17]: cut her off every time she speaks?
[SPEAKER_06]: I could try.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it wouldn't be hard at all.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just busting balls.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love your passion and I love your
excitement and I know you very well as a
[SPEAKER_17]: person.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know you're not, you're a good
person.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just know that in my heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the main reasons I have a tendency
to do that and I know I do it is because I
[SPEAKER_06]: think of something that I think is
important and I want to say it and I
[SPEAKER_06]: should just get a pencil and paper,
but I don't.
[SPEAKER_17]: Before you forget it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so not offended.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so not offended.
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually I was thinking, so Don
Warshafter is on our, he's on the center
[SPEAKER_15]: for cannabis and social policy board with
me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause we were, we were talking about Jack
hair on clubhouse as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: And about how Jack hair, like if you had
weed, he would just come over and be like,
[SPEAKER_15]: what you got?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, look in your bag and like take a
handful of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Don does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, how about this?
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's talk about the difference between
that and skunk man, Sam, skunk man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sam doesn't even accept things from people
generally.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like for the, for a very long time,
I was blown away when I could actually
[SPEAKER_17]: produce something that he would smoke.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's almost the opposite.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not only will he not take your stash,
he's probably not going to smoke it in any
[SPEAKER_17]: way, shape or form, unless it's up to a
certain level of quality, which I also
[SPEAKER_17]: always was impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_17]: You had some people that were just willing
to kind of get in there and take whatever
[SPEAKER_17]: they could get.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you got Sam, who's just like,
I've sorted out everything I need for
[SPEAKER_17]: myself.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm, I'm not taking anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can't say that I gave a lot of
cannabis away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did give quite a bit, but compared to
seeds, I used to walk in the million man
[SPEAKER_06]: march here in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would take a two kilo bag of seeds
with me, and I would hand out a handful to
[SPEAKER_06]: anybody who wanted it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would listen to them because they
were mostly Dutch people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd hear them, what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other one would say, Oh,
it's Henepsaard.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, it's just handful.
[SPEAKER_17]: In the meantime, he's given away stunt
number ones.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, you told me those stories before.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've given away like nice genetics to
people that just had no idea.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's also there's something really
wonderful about that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause you have to know that some of those
random people went home and plugged that
[SPEAKER_17]: into some, some dirt and grew that up and
was just like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_17]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of those stories too, you know,
those, the million dollar march,
[SPEAKER_17]: the million man march, and also the,
the Queens day celebration.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where you'd pull out those goo balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clarified ghee with a monogram of THC and
extracted from a script number one,
[SPEAKER_06]: actually, or from a task.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I got to think some people had a
pretty intense trip.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like you couldn't just give those to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I would tell people that you should
only eat a half of one first to wait a few
[SPEAKER_06]: hours before you eat anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for people like Mila who she could
pop two or three in her mouth and walk
[SPEAKER_06]: down the street, you know, no problem at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: So could our friend Robbie, but you know,
and I, if I would eat like five of them,
[SPEAKER_06]: I would start sort of getting shaky and I
couldn't stand up very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,000 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's got to be something that's beyond a
heroic dose, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_17]: Five dried grams.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, Oh, I thought you meant
THC.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, Terrence.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't realize you were talking about
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fully decarboxylized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Immediate uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Alexia-Jaxia metabolite.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wish people could understand.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish people could understand.
[SPEAKER_17]: Decarboxylized.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a Sam patented word.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's decarboxylized.
[SPEAKER_17]: Decarboxylized.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's laded.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a copyright on that.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's laded.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not lized.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I wrote that down in 2008.
[SPEAKER_17]: Beautiful.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see Johnny B just joined clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I had a link to it and I was
like, wow, clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone's trying to get me to join.
[SPEAKER_07]: I clicked onto it and I was like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went over to Mark, checked out your
clubhouse, follow what you're following.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we like the same shit and I'm going
to check it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you're going to weigh more than check
it out, John.
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll be living on clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's going to be living on it.
[SPEAKER_17]: If the amount of time that you have,
you'll probably spend 10 plus hours on
[SPEAKER_17]: clubhouse a day.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just told you were on a group with
somebody else that I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then within two seconds, I'm like,
okay, that just made sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Johnny, it's okay to not go on the
stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be and have the energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I won't go on stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to go in and listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't feel compelled sometimes that you
have to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay to just sit back and just listen
if you're not in the mood to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just FYI moderation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot of us fall in quickly deep in
the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's inviting you to every single
room to talk and discuss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nothing wrong with that,
but you want to be able to match the
[SPEAKER_03]: levels in the rooms and those levels can
be mighty high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just realize, check yourself before you
wreck yourself sort of situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good advice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause that site is absolutely bonkers and
the caliber.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been in some rooms where it's just
been kind of really noobs and they're all
[SPEAKER_17]: like willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I've been in other rooms where
it's like, you just have the highest
[SPEAKER_17]: caliber of people talking about the things
they know everything about.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really nice to listen to people
speak eloquently and articulately.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we just talk to for a second about the
diversity?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have noticed that just the different
cultures and how they regard cannabis and
[SPEAKER_15]: how they use cannabis is blowing me away
as well as some of the knowledge some of
[SPEAKER_15]: them actually have and are bringing into
their communities.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm stunned with the information that they
do have.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm also so appreciative of the
different cultures.
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been in rooms where I've definitely
been a minority in the room and just
[SPEAKER_17]: loving the conversation and really getting
into sort of these difficult conversations
[SPEAKER_17]: that maybe some people don't want to have.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've enjoyed it all.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't say enough about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's extremely diverse.
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually brought it up in a very diverse
room about how that there seems to be a
[SPEAKER_15]: difference between white culture and black
culture when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got schooled and I appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I was just, I asked questions
because I wanted to know not because I was
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to have a bias and they were open
and honest and it was so refreshing and so
[SPEAKER_15]: appreciative.
[SPEAKER_17]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_17]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't in clubhouse, but recently I was
visiting a shop on commercial drive here
[SPEAKER_17]: in Vancouver, run by this really great
woman who is super dynamic and she's an
[SPEAKER_17]: African Canadian woman.
[SPEAKER_17]: She said to me when I was speaking,
we were talking about the different
[SPEAKER_17]: markets and we were like, oh, the gray
market, the legal market, the black
[SPEAKER_17]: market.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, you know what, I don't use
the term the black market.
[SPEAKER_17]: It sort of is a negative connotation and
it sort of was the end of my using that
[SPEAKER_17]: term.
[SPEAKER_17]: She's like, I just appreciate if you
called it the gray market.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was like, you know what,
thanks for sharing that with me.
[SPEAKER_17]: And thanks for putting me in check.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will make sure that I don't say
those words out my mouth anymore.
[SPEAKER_17]: That gray market is easy enough for me.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was, you know, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: I like free market.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Free market.
[SPEAKER_17]: Free market.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's even better.
[SPEAKER_17]: Free market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also use no traditional market to
stabilize the previous market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems to be a better understanding
for what the underground market is that we
[SPEAKER_03]: like here in California came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tend to use traditional markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're saying traditional market,
that's what we're meaning that that has
[SPEAKER_03]: been traditionally the underground market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Etienne, that's how we've called it
on the East Coast, New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all these these states that are
coming online, we've always consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: called it the traditional market because
that's traditionally how we would get our
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I concur with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nomenclature matters.
[SPEAKER_13]: How ironic that it like I used to use the
term black market all the time and not
[SPEAKER_13]: even think about the origin of the word
until this year when Black Lives Matter
[SPEAKER_13]: really brought it out that, hey,
wait a second.
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason why it's called the black
market is because they wanted to associate
[SPEAKER_13]: it with black people.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like that's totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm never going to use that again.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a guy in the room right now who
says, I don't think a black market is
[SPEAKER_17]: having a negative connotation.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that might be part of your white
privilege.
[SPEAKER_17]: But when I spoke with this black woman,
she guaranteed had a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: She wasn't upset, but she asked me
respectfully not to use the term around
[SPEAKER_17]: her.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was absolutely happy to comply.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, why would you use terms that
create uncomfortableness or a hostile
[SPEAKER_17]: environment?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and I think you hit the nail on the
head when you say white privilege,
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, because we're all white here and we
don't understand that for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so for someone to be in a different
color skin and for them to react to those
[SPEAKER_13]: words, and to school us, I mean,
hey, that's a schooling that I'll take,
[SPEAKER_13]: please.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if someone's telling you that,
it's like, why not just respect them?
[SPEAKER_15]: Why buck them?
[SPEAKER_15]: Just say, OK.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's about everyone appreciating
different cultures.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the love.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's funny how much this conversation is
upsetting people in chat right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: There are absolute people in chat who are
like, you're being too sensitive.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, jeez, I'm leaving.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, that's my privilege,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to accept it with humility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's coming from a place of
privilege.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cannot listen to other cultures and
listen to look through their eyes in their
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, then you need to step back a
second because I have an involved person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just being bald, going to dead
shows, I was considered a narc or a cop
[SPEAKER_03]: because I looked particularly in a
particular way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been chased up trees because I was a
punk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have eggs thrown at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had people try to beat me up and
challenge me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand from a slight perspective,
but I'm still a white male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't understand from a black,
brown, Native American perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, from every other color.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it behooves me to humble myself to
listen as a student of Earth as opposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: a white person of privilege, depending on
my monetary status.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, people can't accept being
challenged to people can't accept humility
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's something that is a
challenge to every being.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we must listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must listen to these perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grant Clubhouse one of the most
amazing things is that you are forced into
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity and these diverse discussions
because they are the moderators.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are having the discussions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes they are specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I recommend going into these rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm part of various other rooms of equity
and color because I want to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to absorb so that I can be aware of
that perspective because it's important
[SPEAKER_03]: because we've ignored perspective for so
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be more listening than
necessarily talking.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And your words are resonating very,
very, very strongly with me.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could hug you through the computer,
I'd be hugging you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's all hug each other.
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's all puff a bowl.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm down with smoking a little hash this
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love that, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_17]: A brain hug.
[SPEAKER_03]: A high is a brain hug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get a brain hug for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is everyone smoking on right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a question I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a little strawberry banana hash
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got strong Nana right here too,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you all smoking on?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: This white fire.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ash and Kelly.
Yay.
[SPEAKER_17]: Alien OG.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they just showed up at the perfect
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: A full bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragonfly Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is that jar of love?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.
Yum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got, even though it's low yields on the
hash, I still love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my, my all time favorite.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just aware of so many Kush Terps.
[SPEAKER_13]: What Jack is a low yielder.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so, so, uh, the resin on Jack
is just for me at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what Jack's, you guys are
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's everyone has their ideology
of what Jack Herrera is, but, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that resin to be too greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and the micron sizes are, are lend
towards a smaller head sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get a larger yield in a 45 than I
would in, let's say the 90 and 73 and 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, however, the terpenes on that varietal
and that, that just, that particular cut
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have are just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll, I'll spend all day making it
just for my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's, yeah, I, you know,
I walk around and I feel the resin and I
[SPEAKER_02]: have, you know, over the years I've kind
of developed my own version and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone has their own version of what
resin works for them and their particular
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find the things that are less that
are more greasy to be lower yielding and
[SPEAKER_02]: in the bags that I'm not, you know,
honing in on as much such as the 90 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 73, but I still love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I just, like I said,
I'll, I'll wash that all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found Jack to be a great mortgage man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a great filmmaker, but not
necessarily something that's in my stash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, from the hash to the
flower, I've just never been a fan of that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular varietal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I remember the year it was released
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember Sensi had a big plant of it on
the top floor of the PAX party house in
[SPEAKER_17]: the back corner of the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I'm not sure if it was like 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was at the, no, I think it was 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I w we went to the castle when they
actually did it with this castle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we got to then go see the flowering,
uh, father that was all flowered out
[SPEAKER_03]: downstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an actual father that was fully
flowered out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like, cause I've never seen a
fully flowered out male to that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, Holy shit,
that's fucking bad ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're in a cannabis castle nuts.
[SPEAKER_13]: So is, is the, is the phenomena that leads
to low yield?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is, is that, um, what you were saying,
Colin, like a certain degree of,
[SPEAKER_13]: of greasiness that has to do with not
being able to get good.
[SPEAKER_13]: A head recovery or what?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's, what's exactly the.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few things that, you know,
this is anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get deeper on the understanding
of why trichomes are collected and sieved
[SPEAKER_02]: easier than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think there's a, there's a
trifecta happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the head size, you have the
terpenes that are being created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the way that it's grown.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these things together create what
I consider the, the, the pyramid of how
[SPEAKER_02]: you can select for resin and select for a
yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, that is not a silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're going to have every
varietals and every phenome and even every
[SPEAKER_02]: even keynote type is going to have a
different, um, expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that expression is going to be needed
to be treated differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you're in the process and in
your process, the selection has to do
[SPEAKER_02]: right now for me, um, it's very intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walk the room, I feel the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I look at how it snaps off my finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I then do test washes that are smaller
washes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to understand what the resin is
doing when I, when you do these smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: washes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I look for color,
look for clarity, I look for all that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but it all has to do with the three
things I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we need to better understand why,
um, you know, this is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sure Marcus has a lot of
insight on that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but some, some, you know, I found that
for instance, some heads are hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want, they want to, they want to
float in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've, I've definitely looked
at things under a microscope and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to better understand it,
but we're still a long ways away from
[SPEAKER_02]: really having like, Hey, this is what you
need to look for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I would say one other point that
you're missing is when you're making dry
[SPEAKER_06]: sift, how long you dry and cured and age
the resin before you sift it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we always tried to do it for three
months because that gave us more of a,
[SPEAKER_06]: of a raisin rather than a grape.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, it was a lot easier to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever take a look at just looking at
the, the act of water or taking a look at
[SPEAKER_07]: the relative humidity in the room?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I like my, when I do my collecting
of like, say first bounce, I always wait,
[SPEAKER_07]: hang dry for about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that last day or two,
I dropped the humidity from like 65 down
[SPEAKER_07]: to like 50% just to do that first little
bounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it raises back up in the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that I do,
um, to get that time of like that first
[SPEAKER_07]: little first melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Johnny, Johnny, you used, you talking
about doing a dry, like dry material wash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: But just making a first bounce,
like hang drying your plants and then
[SPEAKER_07]: taking that first little dry sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there, I, I used to like,
I got different methods of doing like
[SPEAKER_07]: making for hash, but I'm just listening to
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like it because I mean,
I look at some yields, like I'm having
[SPEAKER_07]: problems pulling bags now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just getting really bad on my
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to find other ways of,
of actually, uh, like you're saying how
[SPEAKER_07]: the resin is collecting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I get like, less yields on some
strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, when I just took right now,
I took some of my stuff and I gave it to
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim to make an extraction for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it came back with fire and like the
turpees, everything is like something I've
[SPEAKER_07]: never really had before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the work I'm speaking on is
just fresh frozen stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I do do dry, um, washes often,
but in terms of what I've been doing for
[SPEAKER_02]: the past couple, few years is really
focusing on fresh frozen washes and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to up the yield in that realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm looking, mainly the stuff I've
been looking for are a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fresh terpenes off the plants,
not, not so much the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpenoids, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that, you know, if we can
clarify for the audience here,
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing that I was talking about was
really about fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but I think when you're getting into
what Johnny's talking about, I think he's
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, there's dry,
there's techniques for your dry cure that
[SPEAKER_02]: you really need to pay attention to,
um, that go beyond fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's almost, sometimes a
different approach, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, um, to, to collecting the resin heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I going to just say, I just thought I
put everything in the freezer this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got like 10 pounds of wheat in my
freezer to start washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was just going to, going to say,
you know, there's, there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways for everyone to collect
heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're, you know, we've all
been doing this for, I mean, since I was,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were young and, and, you know,
two decades later, I think we're,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even Sam just pointed out something
really helpful is your curing and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: cure it, um, is really specific to your,
you know, to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and ultimately in the, in the
regulated market, I don't have,
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't have the luxury to dry
cure that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I wish I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a, another conversation
in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, um, a lot of people look at
dates and they want to know that that was
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a specific date.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's like X amount of months old,
they kind of look at it in an adverse way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think to, you know, Sam's point
that that's not really a right way to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have varying quality,
different techniques to get to the same
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You lose a bit of terpenes when you age
for three months.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll admit that, but I prefer the smoke
from aged dry cannabis and, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: I find the wet, uh, frozen, fresh frozen
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too terpy for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and maybe it's the wrong terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The more volatile ones are still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm getting rid of a little bit more
of those, but, but whatever people like
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in favor of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, there is a million ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a very different product,
I will say, because the year that I went
[SPEAKER_17]: to the cup and I made some dry sift from
Matt, the great gardeners, sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was incredible, really beautiful
stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was well long cured.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I sifted it and kept it for like
six plus months before I ended up at the
[SPEAKER_17]: cup.
[SPEAKER_17]: And everyone, this was kind of one of
those years where it was all just starting
[SPEAKER_17]: the full melt crew caught on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I can't make full melt, but I can
certainly make full melt.
[SPEAKER_17]: If I start using fresh frozen material and
I shred the heads with a microplane,
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got melty hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I coined that term faux melt.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was really the initial start of
fresh frozen and capturing all of these
[SPEAKER_17]: mono terpenes that generally we've been
curing out of the product for decades
[SPEAKER_17]: because they're super fucking harsh.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not lovely terpenes to inhale into
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that year was a year that tons of
people had fresh frozen bubble and live
[SPEAKER_17]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_17]: And everyone was bragging about their
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you take a hit and it was just like
razor blades in your throat.
[SPEAKER_17]: It would just stop you dead.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you cough, cough, cough, cough,
cough.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this sweet skunk rosin that I had,
I remember smoking it with Tony from
[SPEAKER_17]: Sagamarta Seeds.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were at, I think we were in Hank's
apartment above the Bulldog in the
[SPEAKER_17]: Leidseplein.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so he had been smoking and it was kind
of the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was a ton of people in the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember rare dankness and DNA and Remo
and tons of good folks were in the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were all puffing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Tony is just like, he came up to me,
he's like, man, bubble man, you got to
[SPEAKER_17]: have something for me to smoke.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I can't smoke this, this stuff
anymore.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's killing my throat.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was why we all left with,
you know, one of the reasons we all left
[SPEAKER_17]: with the cannabis cough, like with those
mono terps for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he hit some of this sweet skunk and
I'll never forget him sitting back on the
[SPEAKER_17]: chair and blowing this huge cloud out and
just looking over at me and being like,
[SPEAKER_17]: now that is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_17]: A properly cured hash that doesn't cut
your throat and shred your throat.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it stood out as an anomaly at the cup
that year because literally, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: maybe the only person that, the only other
person that had something like that would
[SPEAKER_17]: have been Sam, where he actually had cured
the flower, dried it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dry sifting is not a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like making those heads look like raisins
is definitely part of the trick.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, getting them off of the plant
when the wax membrane is still like full
[SPEAKER_17]: of moisture and it's still whole and
doesn't have those ripples and wrinkles in
[SPEAKER_17]: it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is also, you know, you're going to end up
having to reduce the moisture content of
[SPEAKER_17]: your hash down the road.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure Cuban must have to be doing that
because he's extracting those heads when
[SPEAKER_17]: they're, when they're barely dry.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can tell by photographing his resin,
they're all full and have very little
[SPEAKER_17]: wrinklage in them whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you look at their heads that I
photographed from Sam, they've all been
[SPEAKER_17]: properly cured out for, I mean,
I don't know how long you did it,
[SPEAKER_17]: Sam, but it seemed like the material
must've sat for months.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cured them for three months,
the plant, after I dried it for two weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: in the dark hanging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I boxed it for three months and cured
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I sifted it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always sifted it when the humidity
was super low, because if you tried,
[SPEAKER_06]: for example, if you tried using one of
Mila's machines in a hot, humid place,
[SPEAKER_06]: the resin, it just gunks up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gunks up the screen, it gunks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your yields are ridiculous when you know.
[SPEAKER_17]: You weren't a Tumblr guy though.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I used it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, because it was
available and it was easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used big flat, they were aluminum
stretched silk screens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were really quite big.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, most of the ones I used were like
six by four feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you even had like, I think it was
like eight foot by five foot I measured
[SPEAKER_17]: one time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would never forget how much we made,
how fast we made it when you, me and our
[SPEAKER_17]: other friend were there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was just like, he's just like,
oh, grab one of those, go grab one of
[SPEAKER_17]: those barrels.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's just got like a wall of these
barrels.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, what's in the barrel?
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, oh, that's, we're going to
sift it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just like full of like, like material
to sift.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just dumped it out on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually the leftover from being
deseeded.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: But what an amazing experience to dump
half a 55 gallon barrel drum over a
[SPEAKER_17]: screen, rake it with two of my best hash
buddies, and then lift the screen up.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we made 4,000 grams of sift.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was like, I want to say like four
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it took more like 10 minutes,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever 10 minutes to make four thousand
grams is ridiculous, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the picture of after you cleaned it
and you were like, here, this is all the
[SPEAKER_17]: garbage, but it still looked like sift.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I threw it in your toilet and took a
picture of it in your toilet.
[SPEAKER_17]: Man, people could not wrap their heads
around that shit at all.
[SPEAKER_17]: People were having a hard time with that
picture for years afterwards.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were just like, tossing kilos of
sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the difference when you have enough
to do things right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, you know, I would have preferred to
not even use deseeded, but I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: that available.
So.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_17]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good old days.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always like a three month cure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, high north, Frenchy,
Canole and Loughlin are doing these really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome testing with curing hash and what
happens with the cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just really cool to be watching
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got really old, old hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it's aging, they're testing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just super awesome to follow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here, you just inspired me, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_17]: You just inspired me.
[SPEAKER_17]: This little dab right here is 12 years
old.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just took a little chunk off my deck.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll have a little dab of the 12 year
master kush that tastes like the most
[SPEAKER_17]: perfumed out terpene.
[SPEAKER_17]: You could ever imagine the terpenes have
changed completely, but they're still
[SPEAKER_17]: present in this hash after this long.
[SPEAKER_06]: How was the material?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the material kept frozen?
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_17]: The material hardened on the outside and
sealed the inside.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's as hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcus, what was the stuff that we used in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kept stuff for about 15 years frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seemed like it was only a month
older.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it really hardly changed.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember that stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it was from your 91 harvest.
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got a better memory than me.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just remember because our friend,
the fat man, also used to have a little
[SPEAKER_17]: bit and he would always come to my hotel
at the Krasnopolsky and be like,
[SPEAKER_17]: I brought you a little bit of the 50.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, it's 16 years old now or
it's 14.
[SPEAKER_17]: He got it actually, he got it up to like,
I think 19 or 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_17]: He still had a little bit, but his was
completely red and it was void of all
[SPEAKER_17]: flavor and terpenes by the time it was 20
years old.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was cause it was also in powder.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just, it was very unique in the
sense that when I hit it, it was the most
[SPEAKER_17]: creeper weed product I've ever hit in my
life.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know if that was because it
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he kept that stuff frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you keep it frozen and away from oxygen
and light and heat, it really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really barely changes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thank you all for doing that for
science.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I smoke it all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would never say a hash for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you're making a kilo or 10
kilos a hash a day, you can't smoke it
[SPEAKER_06]: really, believe me.
[SPEAKER_06]: True that.
True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Marcus, what was the stuff that you
and I had a couple of years ago when I
[SPEAKER_02]: came to visit you in Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the variety that was with
Daniel?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just remember it being super dynamic
and I was so lit all day from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it, where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like over 10 years old that you,
it was this, you just put, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: look, we got to try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like, I've had this for over a
decade.
[SPEAKER_17]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was probably the master Kush.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was probably this master Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, yeah, it was just really
dynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very different from what I,
at the time had been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you know, you said the Monoturps and
the Sesquiterps that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: are so in your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have this totally different
experience off this material that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: aged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just super different in terms of,
of, you know, the, the feeling and the
[SPEAKER_02]: overall effect profile, but it was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm excited to be going in for a dab of it
right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: So how about that?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at, I'm looking at Frenchie's
data that he posted a week or so ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think 12 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sam and I had commented on this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm looking at Angel Vasquez
comment here, but if you look at it,
[SPEAKER_13]: he's just seeing decarbonized peroxylation
on storage, which is nothing to be
[SPEAKER_13]: affected really.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and I guess the only other
interesting aspect of this is if you look
[SPEAKER_13]: at the age stuff, all of a sudden there's
THCV.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in all the other previous examples,
there weren't any THCV.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what that tells me is that the age
sample has lost considerable amounts of
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes, which basically now moves the
amount of THCV, which was always this
[SPEAKER_13]: there to begin with, but was diluted by
the fact that the earlier samples had
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes in there, just diluting the THCV.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that the age hash sample has lost its
terpenes, you could actually get a more
[SPEAKER_13]: better representation of the, of the
cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's interesting though, like from one to
one, one data point to the other,
[SPEAKER_13]: he shows THCA going down, which is what
you would expect, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause THCA decarboxylates to make THC,
a THC number goes up a little bit
[SPEAKER_13]: accordingly, and you see a little bit of
rise in CBN, but actually very strangely
[SPEAKER_13]: CBDA goes up.
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you make more cannabinoid acids on
standing?
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what that tells you again, is somewhat
of the sensitivity of the HPLC measurement
[SPEAKER_13]: itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you're getting into the weeds
where making small differences of these
[SPEAKER_13]: numbers are really going to have a big
impact.
[SPEAKER_13]: And whether it's 67% or 68% or,
you know, 65% is going to really make a
[SPEAKER_13]: big difference because as you start to
lose your terpene content in aged hash
[SPEAKER_13]: material, what you're going to be left
with is the non-volatile components of
[SPEAKER_13]: your extract, which are going to be the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cannabinoids don't volatilize,
they will decarboxylate with time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'd expect to see that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I recently ran a test of a piece of Panama
red that was 10 years old and had no THCA
[SPEAKER_13]: in it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just, it was all THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: So everything that was left on the plant
material had completely decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not out of the ordinary to see.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it decarboxylating from room
temperature?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it happens at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just really slow at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reaction is first order and
linearly increased.
[SPEAKER_13]: It increases with an increase in
temperature.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you increase temperature,
the reaction rate goes faster and faster
[SPEAKER_13]: and faster and faster.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, it happens at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just really slow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, 10 years, I expected to see
a little bit of trace cannabinoid acids,
[SPEAKER_13]: but no, a flower sample 10 years old kept
aerobically.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is kind of like what Sam and
Colin were pointing to earlier.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was a comment in the,
in the chat room about this too,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is the difference between cured and
uncured.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's really, there's two aspects
about post harvesting or production in
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one is drying, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's a lot of water in the
material, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So the plant material has to be dried,
but then there's curing and they happen
[SPEAKER_13]: independent from one another.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not necessarily related,
although curing happens during the drying
[SPEAKER_13]: process.
[SPEAKER_13]: Drying happens pretty quickly getting down
to the point where you're drying the
[SPEAKER_13]: flower material below the point at which
it could support mold growth.
[SPEAKER_13]: Typically that number used to be 14%.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen the hemp industry here in the U
S want to move that number down to 11%.
[SPEAKER_13]: Typically when we take biomass in a
building, we like to see anywhere between
[SPEAKER_13]: 10% or lower in just water activity in the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll tell you that it won't,
it won't foul.
[SPEAKER_13]: But where that is also really,
really important too, is that if you're
[SPEAKER_13]: measuring cannabinoid content and you're
measuring it on fresh biomass,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's got water in it versus dried
biomass, which has got no water in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to get a completely different
result, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have to be able to take your fresh
cannabis, weigh it, characterize it,
[SPEAKER_13]: dry it, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Pull all that water out because that water
creates weight and all of that weight is
[SPEAKER_13]: going to throw your cannabinoid
measurement off.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to make it seem like it's a lot
lower than it is when actually
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids in the dry biomass are
greater than they are in the wet biomass
[SPEAKER_13]: because water, there's quite a bit of
water in freshly grown biomass.
[SPEAKER_13]: But just to mention, one thing about the
cure is that it's important, and I guess
[SPEAKER_13]: this speaks to something that Sam has
always talked about, that harshness of
[SPEAKER_13]: fresh cannabis and what we know from doing
terpene profiling is that there's an
[SPEAKER_13]: abundance of a particular single terpene
called mersene.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can think of mersene as kind of like
the mother of all terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mersene can go in five different ways to
five different terpenes, which can go to
[SPEAKER_13]: five different terpenes and so on and so
on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what happens in the curing process is
actually that mersene doesn't only
[SPEAKER_13]: evaporate, it also is oxidized and
converted over into oxygenated terpenes or
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: So once terpenes react with oxygen,
so oxygenated terpenes, an example is
[SPEAKER_13]: linalool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Linalool has an oxygen and there's other
terpenes like camphor that have oxygen.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as soon as they have an oxygen
molecule, now it's going to completely
[SPEAKER_13]: change the flavor profile because the
flavor of those oxygenated terpenoids
[SPEAKER_13]: changes the overall essence of the native
terpene profile when the plant is freshly
[SPEAKER_13]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe that that curing process is
not only evaporating, which again maybe
[SPEAKER_13]: cuts back a little bit on the harshness of
just too much terpenes, but it also
[SPEAKER_13]: changes the terpenes chemically into a
kind of like an aged wine profile or an
[SPEAKER_13]: aged cheese profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, cheese and wine in particular
are things that are aged and when they're
[SPEAKER_13]: aged, they're aerobically reacting with
air and kind of changing up things a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit to make them a little bit
different in how they taste and what their
[SPEAKER_13]: flavor is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now we're getting... So Mark,
you know, I've noticed over the years with
[SPEAKER_02]: dry sift versus fresh frozen versus,
you know, dry material processing,
[SPEAKER_02]: the experience and the terpene profiles
are vastly different and the taste
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles are vastly different,
even though they represent one another in
[SPEAKER_02]: some form factor or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpene and the terpenoid are very
different in terms of taste on one's
[SPEAKER_02]: palate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have any explanation for why
this aged process, you know, is treating
[SPEAKER_13]: these similar profiles with very different
feelings?
[SPEAKER_13]: The oxygenated terpenes are, you know,
carvone is one,
[SPEAKER_13]: one isomer of carvone.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, when I say isomers or
enantiomers, they're kind of like your
[SPEAKER_13]: hands.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so there's a right-handed version and
there's a left-handed version,
[SPEAKER_13]: right, left, right, left.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of them smells, one of the
versions of carvone smells like rye bread,
[SPEAKER_13]: like caraway seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, if you get freshly cut rye
bread and it's got the caraway seed,
[SPEAKER_13]: that caraway, the other one, which is just
the mirror image of this molecule,
[SPEAKER_13]: is completely spearmint peppermint.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, how the human palate has
developed the ability to ascertain the
[SPEAKER_13]: differences in these molecular structures
to give different, you know, elicit
[SPEAKER_13]: different reactions is just, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's how sophisticated the human palate is
and why we can taste different elements of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so like we were talking last week
about what the most valuable terpene and
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm on team terpenylene.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, terpenylene, again,
actually there's a couple of different
[SPEAKER_13]: versions of terpenylene and cannabis,
again, creates this opportunity to really
[SPEAKER_13]: exploit all these compounds in different
ways that they manifest their different
[SPEAKER_13]: flavors and scents.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've said it before, I'll say it
again.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was terpenes that drew humans to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was cannabinoids that made them stay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say, Mark, that when we did
analysis stability testing, this was 25
[SPEAKER_06]: years ago, what we found was that even
after two years of storage, most of the
[SPEAKER_06]: THC was in the acid form.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the terpenes were gone and that
there was little to no CBN.
[SPEAKER_13]: This nugget of Panama Red, I think was
just in a baggie, in a dresser drawer for
[SPEAKER_13]: like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was no special care to its
storage or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, it's not at all,
you know, unbelievable to think that
[SPEAKER_13]: again, prolonged storage in the right
environment that that stuff is going to
[SPEAKER_13]: decarboxylate.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why when I looked at Frenchies
data, I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: this looks, I would expect to see exactly,
exactly this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, again, it would be
interesting to look at, I guess,
[SPEAKER_13]: the terpene profile on aging, because what
I would expect, and again, this is the
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff that we've already talked about
episodes prior on Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_13]: is that we would see Hash, Hashishin,
am I not saying it right?
[SPEAKER_13]: We would see the formation of Hashishin on
the outside because it's a light catalyzed
[SPEAKER_13]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_13]: So where light is able to sort of react
with the terpenes that are on the surface
[SPEAKER_13]: of the hash, I think what that paper
talked about was sort of scraping off the
[SPEAKER_13]: surface.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they found sort of like this oxidative
degradation coat that where this Hashishin
[SPEAKER_13]: degradation would be.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would expect that if you follow the
terpene profile in the curing of the
[SPEAKER_13]: flour, that you would see exactly what,
what, what Frenchie sees in his data too,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is that not only do the terpenes
change, but they probably, they're
[SPEAKER_13]: fugitive, meaning that they evaporate.
[SPEAKER_13]: And once they evaporate, they go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: In India, you don't find Hashishin,
you find Charsey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mark, you know, I, over time,
I have some terpene samples that I've kept
[SPEAKER_02]: for around four years now in freezing,
you know, minus in freezing conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing, it being coming less
viscous and more jelly-like over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm waiting another six months to get
that, the samples tested, cause I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: timeline on the test, on the shelf life
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm curious to see how this
consistency is going to match up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles, you know, the ability to show
the spectrum of all the terpenes that were
[SPEAKER_02]: once present when we first put them in
versus when we took them out versus what
[SPEAKER_02]: they've actually turned into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some have oxidized and some have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're seeing color in some,
but in others, you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, you know, that alone,
what you're touching on is, is really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting to me because it's,
it shows in, in, in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just illustrates what we're actually
seeing in real time and in terms of a
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf life study.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and, and cannabinoids act as
antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So cannabinoids actually stabilize the
terpenes from oxidizing in certain ways,
[SPEAKER_13]: shapes or form.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really interesting because with a lot
of the hemp processing that's going on
[SPEAKER_13]: these days, you know, I think the first
goal of, of hemp was to sort of get,
[SPEAKER_13]: get CBD out the door.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think now they're paying a little
bit more attention to the minor
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids and now finally the terpenes,
you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I think what's really
fascinating here is I think that like most
[SPEAKER_13]: of these people who are growing these
beautiful varieties of hemp and then just
[SPEAKER_13]: basically treating it as just a raw
ingredient to make CBD isolate are really
[SPEAKER_13]: missing most of the value that's within
the hemp plant, which is all the minor
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids, the minor terpenes and
everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even if you're trying to make a
business model today of opening up a
[SPEAKER_13]: facility to turn hemp into CBD isolate,
you're probably going to be pressed to
[SPEAKER_13]: not, well, you're probably going to be
pressed to look at other adjacent
[SPEAKER_13]: opportunities because you're not going to
be able to make a whole lot of money just
[SPEAKER_13]: selling CBD isolate these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, you've tested some, probably some of
the oldest hashish or cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the things that have been
found in those resins that are still left
[SPEAKER_03]: over?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are active, inactive?
[SPEAKER_06]: I never tested hash that was older than
about 15, 20 years, number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, I kept it frozen away from
oxygen, away from light and it barely
[SPEAKER_06]: changed.
[SPEAKER_17]: You preserved it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've felt this.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had herb in my freezer for six years
that I pressed into rosin and it was as
[SPEAKER_17]: loud as it would have been six years prior
had I pressed it in before.
[SPEAKER_17]: The only problem was rosin didn't exist
when it went into my freezer, but it did
[SPEAKER_17]: exist.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I took it out six years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then Afghanistan, they used to bury
their, the Keefe, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certain amount of feet deep to keep
it cool back in the day before they
[SPEAKER_03]: actually pressed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, is that just to keep it
refrigerated?
[SPEAKER_06]: Along with the story of in India,
naked people running through the
[SPEAKER_06]: plantation to scrape the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm not sure how much hash was
actually buried or if the reason or,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure, but yeah, I'm not sure hash
gets better after being buried a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends on the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was really cold, it'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, when I hear a story from farmers
or traditional hashish people,
[SPEAKER_06]: I take it with a grain of salt because one
of the, like in India, I've talked to
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers there and they said, oh yeah,
the papaya is from India, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for dismissing that
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's also interesting just to
bring, you know, the microbiology into
[SPEAKER_00]: this discussion is that when you keep it
in the freezer and away from light,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really not allowing colonization of
microbiology on that hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's a big part of the
breakdown as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidation, you know, also makes
microbiology come alive, which is be
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool to see aging studies and
microbiology and the DNA of what comes
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and what is, you know, consuming the
terpenes and the cannabinoids just like
[SPEAKER_00]: totally mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let you say something just one sec,
Mark, but it would be interesting to do,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, a resin curing test with a
hydroponic, you know, herb and then
[SPEAKER_14]: something with a fully living soil one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet that living soil or the soil one
would last longer and have longer probably
[SPEAKER_14]: terpenes in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think microbes are gonna eat up
cannabinoids like it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: young kids going to Dairy Queen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's readily available carbon
and hydrogen energy for microbes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, it doesn't stand a chance.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything, you know, microbes have
figured out how to eat everything except
[SPEAKER_13]: the carbon fluorine bond, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: They haven't figured out how to metabolize
that, but they figured out everything
[SPEAKER_13]: else.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they can do what we used to call in
the field mineralization, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: When you put samples out there and
basically they're consumed immediately.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was on a project where we were looking
at treatments for wood preservation,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Viagra, not the little blue pill of
people.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about things that,
you know, are chemicals that they inject
[SPEAKER_13]: into wood so wood can last in an outdoor
setting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Without being eaten by termites or bugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as it turns out, the first infestation
into wood is not by termites.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the things that eat were not by
fungus.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's by bacteria.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bacteria get into the wood and they
basically ring the dinner bell for
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody else because the bacteria has to
go in there and they have to start
[SPEAKER_13]: loosening up things in order for the
termites and the fungi and all the other
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff to come in and start rotting the
wood.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just a microbial zoo of things
that again has had the time course of
[SPEAKER_13]: evolution to figure out how to properly,
you know, utilize all of the carbon that's
[SPEAKER_13]: in the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why you don't see heaps of
huge, you know, wood on the sides of the
[SPEAKER_13]: road is because it degrades fungus.
[SPEAKER_13]: The fungus has figured out how to degrade
dead wood and dead logs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when they fall in the forest and no
one hears it, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Silent but golden.
[SPEAKER_13]: The, you know, fungi gets in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And before you know it, the termites start
eating up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It becomes a house for all kinds of
microbes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And rotten wood is really, really
important to reestablish the microbial
[SPEAKER_13]: flora of the forest floor.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really important to basically have
this cycle that's been going for eons of
[SPEAKER_13]: evolution to continue.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to know how we started on that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just been learning my discord in the
background.
[SPEAKER_17]: What I saw was, you know, I figured out
this discord thing a little bit through
[SPEAKER_17]: watching these Harry Mack freestyle raps
that he's been doing on Omegle,
[SPEAKER_17]: which if you haven't watched, you should
absolutely watch.
[SPEAKER_17]: This guy's got the like highest vibration
possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's absolutely crushing it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But he turned me on to discord.
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't really been using it,
but someone in the chat was like,
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish there was a discord.
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, I have one.
[SPEAKER_17]: I shared it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now there's a whole chat going on over
here.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can kind of hear it in the background
going ba-bop, ba-bop.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll have to turn that off soon,
but you can share videos.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can share pictures.
[SPEAKER_17]: The chat room will be up forever now cause
it's a discord channel.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it'll be a 24 seven hash church
channel.
[SPEAKER_17]: The address is kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to put it in the link to this
video when we're done.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I did share it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's put it in the chat so I can join
discord.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll put it in the chat.
[SPEAKER_17]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's, it's very, it's like discord.gg.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it's a bunch of silly,
silly, silly letters like five or six,
[SPEAKER_17]: which I won't mention here, but I've got
it in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got it in the private zoom chat and
I'll put it in the comment section of this
[SPEAKER_17]: video when we're done.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would, I would suggest join us on
discord.
[SPEAKER_17]: The chat room will stay up forever.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll keep the link going as long as I can.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it'll really kind of create these
other six days of hash church that aren't
[SPEAKER_17]: happening where we can kind of maybe build
through the chat room, find out questions
[SPEAKER_17]: that people have, create a topic base for
us to talk about on Sunday and maybe even
[SPEAKER_17]: find some great new people to invite on as
panelists.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to kind of chime in on
that.
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't want to change the subject too
much because I really appreciate what you
[SPEAKER_17]: guys are talking about.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh, discord, it's pretty,
I'm just going to say Mark, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: I have discord, but set up a couple of
different, different chat rooms inside
[SPEAKER_07]: discord.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a general set up some rules,
set up stuff on like dry sys, set up stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: on hash just like you have on your
Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Johnny B grow room on discord.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had it for like over a year,
but, uh, it's definitely awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So create different groups in there for
yourself and have a hash church,
[SPEAKER_07]: just a separate topic, just for house
church.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll set that.
[SPEAKER_07]: In your channel and set up like five or 10
or whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that way you have different parts
instead of everybody just going to general
[SPEAKER_07]: and creating a huge, just different thing
in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I joined right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to hash Johnny B grow
room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that a Chuck Berry song?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Johnny B grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might be.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just created the hash church room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, reminds me of true stoners,
uh, from back in the day, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: modern version to true stoners chat and
the first in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for to dirty and to Logan and chat
who mentioned the discord thing in the
[SPEAKER_17]: first, uh, place.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, yeah, I think discord is kind of
like a place.
[SPEAKER_17]: Isn't it kind of like a male chimp where
you can kind of have all your social media
[SPEAKER_17]: is running through discord and have your
chats.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I haven't really played around with it
too much, but it seems pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So many different topics in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put all your links to all your
house churches can be in their house
[SPEAKER_07]: church episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can like go wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I have like 15 years is going
off like crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like messaging me, like you got like
16 new messages in the last minute,
[SPEAKER_07]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just have to figure out how to stop it
from making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, definitely bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hit that bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It meets the sound.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just hit the headphones.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see the bell, but there you're
right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Muting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find different groups in there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on like one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven different discord groups
[SPEAKER_07]: all related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, yeah, it's, it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have a lot of fun in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: First one you showed us with, um,
clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got, I got 58 people online in the chat
room right now, which is obviously not as
[SPEAKER_17]: much as we have in the YouTube we have.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to say this, you know,
the consistency that we offered in the
[SPEAKER_17]: last four weeks has raised our live
viewers by about 20%.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were in and around the 400 range today.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were at 567 people when we topped out
for live people right now, there's
[SPEAKER_17]: actually 523.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we bumped up about a hundred people and
it might not sound like that much,
[SPEAKER_17]: but when you, when it's only 500 people,
that's literally 20% increase.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I like the consistency, even if we
don't have a conversation to talk about.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love the idea of gathering on Sundays,
shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes it's going to be stories about
concerts and the old days and other times
[SPEAKER_17]: it's going to be in depth breakdowns on
science.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, you know, some days it'll be
both, but, uh, yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to say, uh, welcome to Mr. Alec
Dixon.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was sharing your, uh, terpene chart
earlier while Dr. Mark was talking.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also want to welcome Mr. Uh,
best friend farms.
[SPEAKER_17]: In the house, Brian, how are you doing,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_17]: And Alice and Alice girls in green.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even welcome her.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's terrible of me.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, I saw your better half was there
with you as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're supposed to say that when we
talk about our spouses, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: There are better halves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's gone to the farmer's market though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our church is in the same time as farmers
market.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we always have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I appreciate the, uh, the,
um, first of all, I appreciate the energy
[SPEAKER_17]: because, uh, the past church does tend to
be a little bit of a sausage party
[SPEAKER_17]: sometimes, maybe often.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I always appreciate the female energy
and, uh, I try to invite as many females
[SPEAKER_17]: as possible because I have a deep
appreciation for your guys' perspective.
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for having me here and
every Sunday, everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's, let's have a puff and let's,
uh, start talking.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to see people exhaling,
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to get a little lemon
cake in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, remember on that, uh, that post that
you made this week on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_13]: you talked about, you know, rolling out
your hash and I asked you, can you share
[SPEAKER_13]: any data on this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you, are you able to tell us about how
great this material is that you guys are
[SPEAKER_13]: rolling out throughout Canada?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: What I can tell you is a few things.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_17]: And anyone that hasn't muted their discord
and is still listening, uh, have their mic
[SPEAKER_17]: open up here.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm looking at you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, mute that shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can tell you a few things I,
and it's all, you know, it's all kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: funny.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like we can't mention the company that
grew it because we don't have a deal with
[SPEAKER_17]: them to mention their company.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're not keeping them in the shadows
for any reason, other than out of respect
[SPEAKER_17]: for them, because they may go to market
and.
[SPEAKER_17]: Release their own thing down the road.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can't mention their, their name,
but what I can mention is the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an Afghan Kush.
[SPEAKER_17]: It is an Afghan Kush.
[SPEAKER_17]: We are using flower.
[SPEAKER_17]: And because of the system in Canada,
you know, when I first made my first batch
[SPEAKER_17]: and I got my seven to eight varieties,
you know, 220 down to 25, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: I understood suddenly that in order to get
that to market, if you want to keep all of
[SPEAKER_17]: those microns separately, you will now
need to do a $1,500 full test on like
[SPEAKER_17]: yeast and molds counts, pesticides,
herbicides, terpenes, cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, the full test.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you'll have to do it times eight.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you increase $1,500 a test in Canada.
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_17]: Canadian.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So about like 1100 bucks, U S or whatever
for a, for a full, this isn't just
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabinoids or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not paying 4,000 U S a pound.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm just saying like for you,
it's like, cause I pay 6.50 and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: to me, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: U S I pay 6.85, 6.85 panel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was thumbed down because it's
just too much in my mind in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also, but to your point Marcus,
what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know, and so you also have to
make sure here's another thing if you're
[SPEAKER_17]: going to sell to retail here.
[SPEAKER_17]: The provinces are the ones that order.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're selling to like an entire state.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's who's ordering for every store in
the state.
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you get a province and we've
already gotten to, it's a big fucking
[SPEAKER_17]: deal.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a province.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's millions of people that live in it
and you just got to go from a province.
[SPEAKER_17]: So here's the, here's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to release your 90 micron hash
and you want to pay your 6.85 times eight
[SPEAKER_17]: bags to figure out what each micron is and
keep them all separate.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the province might order 20 kilos.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of that from you, maybe even 30.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if they sell it really quick,
cause it's such a spectacular material,
[SPEAKER_17]: you had better have another 20,
30 of kilos ready for them when they want
[SPEAKER_17]: to order it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you don't, you drop to the bottom
of the key.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a good look.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can't supply what you've already
supplied.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if you have five of these provinces
and they're all ordering 20 or 30 kilos at
[SPEAKER_17]: a time and selling through it in a couple
of months, how the fuck are you going to
[SPEAKER_17]: produce that much 90 micron hash?
[SPEAKER_17]: So it becomes a little bit of a trick.
[SPEAKER_17]: What most people do with smaller batches
here in Canada is they sell them into the
[SPEAKER_17]: medical market and you end up having the
ability to kind of give a good deal,
[SPEAKER_17]: sell direct to customers, but it's quite
different from, from the recreational.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I managed to do was, and it was,
it was fairly easy because the material
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm running is quite nice and almost all
of it is this beautiful, consistent golden
[SPEAKER_17]: color.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only really the two 20 that we have
to keep out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that even tested at almost 50% THC,
the two 20.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're getting the rest of it testing in
between the 55 to 70 plus percent.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what I was able to do was make two
grades.
[SPEAKER_17]: I took sort of what I felt like were the
best microns, one 20, 73, 90, 45,
[SPEAKER_17]: those all went into one grade.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I made a B grade, which was like
a one 90, one 60, 25, which was still over
[SPEAKER_17]: 60% THC with a decent terpene content.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I hit it with a hair straightener,
I hit a tiny little bit of the powder and
[SPEAKER_17]: it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, for me, when I hear the smokers
in the room who are pulling the bags and
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm at the back of the lab and I hear them
pull the 90 micron bag and I hear them go,
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that that's good hash, but there's
no mechanisms for me to smoke it,
[SPEAKER_17]: to test it, to try it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I did do is I took a little bit
of powder and I gently hit it with a tiny
[SPEAKER_17]: little bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_17]: And what that did was it created this
beautiful stained glass window.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have shipped out our first batch of
this.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to go buy some in the next
couple of days, probably tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll smash it with the hair
straightener and I'll be able to take some
[SPEAKER_17]: nice pictures of showing how clean and
gold leafy it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: I suspect it's going to melt and boil into
a beautiful liquid, but is it a six star?
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it a five star?
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it a four star?
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope we fall in the five plus,
but because I haven't been able to try it,
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm certainly not going to put my name on
the line and tell people that it's the
[SPEAKER_17]: full melt six star hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I've seen plenty of companies doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've taken a more pragmatic perspective.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to release this hash without
calling it full melt.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it tends to be full melt,
like I suspect it's going to be,
[SPEAKER_17]: then we'll share that with people.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm looking forward to the reviews and
to people.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, man, I'm so excited that hash has
finally gone out from my company.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's under the brand Hank.
[SPEAKER_17]: Co.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is sold throughout British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_17]: The province has it now.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you own a store and you want to give
it a shot, give them a call and it'll be
[SPEAKER_17]: sold under the Hank brand.
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be the Afghan Kush.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's about what I can share for now,
Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super cool, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been working on that project for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, you know, I've watched
you, you know, start that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: What does the hash analyze for?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like what's its potency about,
you know, ballpark?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, what do you expect to see?
[SPEAKER_17]: What's typical of the, of the potency of
the hash in regards to the THC content?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: THCA, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Wouldn't it be THCA?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_17]: In and around like between like,
you know, 60 to 70, this particular hash,
[SPEAKER_17]: the B grade is around the 60.
[SPEAKER_17]: The A grade is around the 60.
[SPEAKER_17]: The B grade is around the 70.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you got about a 10% bump on the A to
the B.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all from the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the idea of giving people the idea.
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't all know about micron sizes,
but they're going to start learning with
[SPEAKER_17]: these two grades.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to be like, wow,
like the grade A is definitely different
[SPEAKER_17]: from the grade B.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, I haven't been able to try it
because our system has created this,
[SPEAKER_17]: this system that does not allow for
pathways.
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently in Canada, you can apply for R
and D licenses where you can get
[SPEAKER_17]: permission to actually try the product.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is very important.
[SPEAKER_17]: This would be the equivalent of letting
people open up restaurants, but not
[SPEAKER_17]: allowing them to test the food before they
put it on a plate for people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I'm not completely blind and I suspect
if Gordon Ramsey needed to bust out a fat
[SPEAKER_17]: meal and wasn't allowed to test it,
he could probably still do a pretty good
[SPEAKER_17]: job on that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But obviously we want and need the ability
to test.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I should, you know, give a shout out
to, to Mike West as well, who's in the
[SPEAKER_17]: room, who's been working with me since
like tirelessly on this project since the
[SPEAKER_17]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's been, he's gone above and beyond any
human being's ability to put more of his
[SPEAKER_17]: time into this project.
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably second only or tied with Craig,
who's also one of my colleagues at Embark.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to shout them both out
because without the work they've done,
[SPEAKER_17]: we wouldn't be where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And a shout out to the whole team for that
matter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you guys are running at the scale
that those reactors are at, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure everybody in the chat room,
all the hash makers who are listening
[SPEAKER_13]: right now, they appreciate, you know,
I mean, when you go from like home scale
[SPEAKER_13]: or, you know, like small production scale
to that scale, and you have that much
[SPEAKER_13]: material at stake, you're talking,
you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars
[SPEAKER_13]: in one batch, I would assume.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and again, it's great to have
Alec on here because again, like that
[SPEAKER_13]: third party testing result and the
relationship that you have with your third
[SPEAKER_13]: party testing lab is really, really
important to be able to get compliant
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff out into the market that meets the
label requirements and all the other
[SPEAKER_13]: regulatory requirements of these new
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I concur with you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to, I just want to say this out loud
for the viewers, what Marcus is doing at
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, everyone from my perspective,
I mean, I wash a lot at scale as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, to put that many grams in
perspective to continuously make at scale
[SPEAKER_02]: at a specific quality level is very,
very detailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tremendous challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not something that you could
take an at home setup and really scale
[SPEAKER_02]: overnight with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's years of Marcus honing in on all of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes beyond hash making and a lot
of respect too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, major respect Marcus on
all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, it's an incredible,
you know, it's incredible, you know.
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be remiss if I didn't shout out
Whistler Technologies and the two Daves
[SPEAKER_17]: and Kelvin and Aaron and obviously the
owner Daniel and the entire sales team,
[SPEAKER_17]: Brishna and Tyler and, you know,
just the other Tyler and we've got a great
[SPEAKER_17]: team over there.
[SPEAKER_17]: They've done an incredible job.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't sure where I was going to land in
this commercial industrialized aspect of
[SPEAKER_17]: water extraction, but their heads,
they came from the right place.
[SPEAKER_17]: They did all their R&D at Whistler Medical
over the course of years.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's been really a blessing to link up
with them, to hook up with them.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go check them out on Instagram at Whistler
Tech, WhistlerTechnologies.ca if you want
[SPEAKER_17]: to check out the website.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, we've done some pretty good
things.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm using 300 litres.
[SPEAKER_17]: We just sold a unit recently that was two
times 2000 litres.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we'll be talking about Rory and his
team over at Sweetwater Hemp in Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_17]: These guys have been growing 3000 plus
acres for decades.
[SPEAKER_17]: They've got contracts with Walmart.
[SPEAKER_17]: They grow veggies.
[SPEAKER_17]: They grow all sorts of different things.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now they're getting into the hemp
game.
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't want to be the same,
same old ethanol extractors, hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_17]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_17]: They went a totally different route.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they've got this monster 4000 litre
reactors, 2000 times two.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the first one we ever built at
Whistler Technologies.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's up on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to go check it out,
it's definitely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, huge shout out to the entire
team at Whistler Technologies for really,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, for doing a ton of this work.
[SPEAKER_17]: I could never take credit for it on my
own.
[SPEAKER_17]: I am merely one small component of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I say, from guys like Skunkman
Sam, being able to stand on the shoulders
[SPEAKER_17]: of giants to all of you panelists,
to the people that are in the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the Sherpa, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: The Sherpas.
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone's got to lead the way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I mean, you can't climb
Mount Everest without a Sherpa.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I know they don't look very
organized, but they're the people who get
[SPEAKER_13]: you there.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're the heroes, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the guys getting the industry to
where they need to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you probably didn't think about this
when you were first making Bubble,
[SPEAKER_13]: but, you know, it's like, how cool to see
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only and, you know, again,
we talked a little bit about this last
[SPEAKER_13]: time, but I don't think your viewers or
the viewers really, really understand that
[SPEAKER_13]: when you spec something into good
manufacturing process to GMP, it is just
[SPEAKER_13]: like all of your food and all your
pharmaceuticals are made this way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now you're applying this to the
production of cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it has all to do with your quality
control and how you source your
[SPEAKER_13]: ingredients and your processes and the
types of stainless steel you use in your
[SPEAKER_13]: tanks and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: It impacts everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why all the people you see back in
Marcus's place are all gown from head to
[SPEAKER_13]: toe, because you can't have beard hair or
mustache hair or, you know, and sure
[SPEAKER_13]: during COVID, it must be an extraordinary
challenge, again, to have people who,
[SPEAKER_13]: again, you don't know where their social
distancing and who they're coming in
[SPEAKER_13]: contact with, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And now you need to bring people into a
facility.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to basically know exactly who's
coming in to where, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a lot of material and inventory at
risk in these facilities.
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, this is why testing is also
important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, Mark, the question I really have,
and again, this is, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_13]: have to answer, but certainly something
that I think we could try to figure out,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is like, now that you're making,
like, a water hash product, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: really, it's probably really important to
know, like, what the shelf life of these
[SPEAKER_13]: things are and, like, how you package it
and how you produce it and how it's
[SPEAKER_13]: packaged and then the quality control
measures of, okay, there has to be like a
[SPEAKER_13]: certain level of moisture or a certain
level of whatever terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you're out of that window,
sorry, that product does not meet
[SPEAKER_13]: specifications by GMP standards.
[SPEAKER_13]: That actually has to be removed and
destroyed or reworked.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're nailing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the whole thing about reworking,
the great thing about cannabis is
[SPEAKER_13]: something like hash, like if it does foul
or something like that, you could
[SPEAKER_13]: essentially rework it back through making
distillate or you could do something to
[SPEAKER_13]: clean it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: But part of your GMP quality control
production processes that have to be in
[SPEAKER_13]: place for these facilities have to go
through every type of scenario that you
[SPEAKER_13]: could possibly imagine where you ship the
material to ATN's dispensary.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now somebody buys it at ATN's
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_13]: They take it home.
[SPEAKER_13]: They send it to a lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it doesn't test for what the label
says.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that guy comes back and wants his
money back and say, hey, this stuff was
[SPEAKER_13]: supposed to be 74%.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always tested at 65%.
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this guy went to this shady lab over
here and this guy wants his business.
[SPEAKER_13]: So he's going to give him the result that
he wants.
[SPEAKER_13]: And starts this loop of how you get third
party testing result labs competing with
[SPEAKER_13]: one another to provide the results that
are needed to meet label requirements.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not a small task to meet when
you're trying to produce these.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what you're saying is that you're
winning over government contracts for
[SPEAKER_13]: entire provinces.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you're talking about going from
this level of production up to this level
[SPEAKER_13]: of production overnight.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not trivial.
[SPEAKER_13]: So my hat's off to you, Marcus,
and all the team of folks that you
[SPEAKER_13]: mentioned, because I know you don't do
this by yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all these talented people.
[SPEAKER_13]: But these are people who bought into your
vision and saw that, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: We can take this high quality product that
we can make at an artisan level and scale
[SPEAKER_13]: it up for the masses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I applaud your instincts,
your bravery, and the people who have
[SPEAKER_13]: basically put money behind you to make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to talk a little bit about that,
Mike, in regards to how we're kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: keeping that going on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so part of the- Hey, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guys hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guys hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so part of the government's
provincial rules, they allow up to a 5%
[SPEAKER_04]: variance from your labeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So any time you list a product,
you actually have basically a plus or
[SPEAKER_04]: minus 5% of what you list on that label.
[SPEAKER_04]: When and if your product is deemed to have
gone through the degradation, either by
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf life or by storage, to be more than
5%, you actually have to have that best
[SPEAKER_04]: buy date listed on your label.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Alec could probably talk a little
bit more about determining shelf life
[SPEAKER_04]: tests, but once those tests have been
determined for the hashes, we actually
[SPEAKER_04]: will have to recall them as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of what we've done is actually
taken a fairly standardized batch of
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers, ran it through a whole assortment
of tests, separating all the microns,
[SPEAKER_04]: testing them, figuring out which ones
would work well to try and fit some
[SPEAKER_04]: desirable potency targets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then combined those different types of
hashes, too, as Mark mentioned,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of a A grade and a B grade,
I think is what they're calling it right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of two different blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're different broad spectrums of
different microns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we actually start adding
different products above and below those
[SPEAKER_04]: different grades, you'll actually start
seeing the different grades come out just
[SPEAKER_04]: like we see with the different products.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mike, do those two fractions test
differently?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like would you see variations in
cannabinoid and terpene levels between
[SPEAKER_13]: those two?
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you homogenize them, they make a
sort of like a statistical mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so in general, the smaller microns
will have a higher terpene to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, some of those terpenes and
primitine precursors are then stacked at
[SPEAKER_04]: the basal cells into the cannabinoids
within that glandular trichrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the highest potencies are in that 90 to
120 or 150 micron range, depending on the
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we kind of did is figured out,
OK, we know that these are going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that have the most mature glandular
trichrome heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also test the highest and are going
to contain the highest terpene content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blend those into kind of a higher grade
one, which ended up coming out with the
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene content, which I don't have the
paper in front of me, Mark, but I think it
[SPEAKER_04]: was 8% potency difference between our
spread in the B grade and our A grade,
[SPEAKER_04]: which basically the B grade had one or two
of the larger glandular trichrome heads to
[SPEAKER_04]: get a lot of potency and then one or two
of the smaller glandular heads,
[SPEAKER_04]: which would have higher terpene content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's interesting to think that
maybe even with the physical size and
[SPEAKER_13]: difference that just in storage,
like if you had this like in a five gallon
[SPEAKER_13]: pail, that the dust at the bottom would
test higher than, say, like the stuff at
[SPEAKER_13]: the top of the container.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you'd be able to see some type of
gradient just on storage that would be
[SPEAKER_13]: either within that 5% window or not,
but I guess the question is, and again,
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike, maybe you've already figured this
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're packaging this, say like in a
puck or like a container or like that,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you're putting it out on the market,
but obviously there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: it stays in inventory and warehouses or
wherever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, at what point does terpene law
start to really move the needle on
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_13]: So like if you look at this data that we
were referring to earlier, this was some
[SPEAKER_13]: Frenchy Canola data that he posted on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just showed again, terpene loss that
you would expect over a month.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's less terpenes there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So actually you could see the impact now
on cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_13]: So is there a point at which say,
well, we made that hash say six months
[SPEAKER_13]: ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now the terpene loss has been sufficient.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sufficient enough that if you were to
test it for cannabinoids now, you're going
[SPEAKER_13]: to find a different number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the government's only regulate the,
they basically say anything you put on the
[SPEAKER_04]: labels have to fall within a certain 5%
range before it falls out of spec.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't regulate the terpenes,
but unfortunately the government of Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't require terpenes to be listed on
labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they would, but it's not required
and not done by producers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, here in Pennsylvania, they put on
like the five most prevalent ones that
[SPEAKER_13]: they find, but I think they run a test
for, I believe 20 different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if you want, you could
actually go to the, when you go to the
[SPEAKER_13]: dispensary, they could actually give you
the report from the lab itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, wow, what a bummer that testing for
terpenes, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not true, Mark.
[SPEAKER_17]: They do test for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: What Mark said, if you listen to him,
was that the government of Canada does not
[SPEAKER_17]: require it, but something everyone tests
for them.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're able to do is kind of
collect those tests for our own data.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in order to actually put them on the
label, you have to actually fit them
[SPEAKER_04]: within the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not required.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, well, what we ended up,
I think, Mark, we were required to put the
[SPEAKER_04]: total cannabinoids, THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they require labeling
on the minor cannabinoids, but many
[SPEAKER_04]: producers will, if they see minor
cannabinoid peaks, they will list it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's no government mandated the
labeling of terpene profiles yet on the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, what they did, what they did
require is whatever you label.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, when you actually submit your
labels, there's a range that you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: submit your labels into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so plus or minus 5% within that range,
every sample or test that they pull,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to have to test that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we had to go through a list,
what are our proposed products for bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime you have that spectrum of
different ranges, each one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: potential product lines has to be listed
as a new and novel cannabis product,
[SPEAKER_04]: NNCP, just like you're listing a different
grade of alcohol, tobacco, or other
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated substance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it becomes a relatively complex thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what most of the provenances want to
be able to see is that you have
[SPEAKER_08]: relationships with existing
[SPEAKER_04]: because the provence has essentially a
monopoly distribution on the distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: We as producers ship to the provence,
the provence then ships to the retailers
[SPEAKER_04]: or puts it online for sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to end up shipping big orders
to the provincial warehouses within the
[SPEAKER_04]: states.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes it a lot harder for the craft
farmers because they can't just start
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing to the small local shops in the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are a few provences that have
started allowing what's called farm gate
[SPEAKER_04]: retail distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what Mark's showing right now is
the pallet that we were wrapping up
[SPEAKER_04]: getting ready to ship to the provence of
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that went to a undisclosed location
here in DC.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much product is that right there,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's 600 kilos of packaging and 5.4
kilos of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 5,400 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you look at all the cardboard
inside of black Myron jars with its own
[SPEAKER_04]: custom labeled, then those had to be
packaged into what the government wants as
[SPEAKER_04]: master cases, just like they want specific
numbers of six packs of beers.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the provences want set units in
the cases that they're offering to retail
[SPEAKER_04]: stores.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you do make seven or eight different
bags of hash and you separate them all out
[SPEAKER_14]: and you find that it's worth testing the
90 and the 73 and maybe the 120,
[SPEAKER_14]: can you take the other ones, combine them,
and make rosin out of that, make one
[SPEAKER_14]: product out of that, and then test that
one product?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to kind of target.
[SPEAKER_04]: The minimum provences want to order is a
couple of kilos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So each one of those fractions have to be
a couple of kilos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we already explained that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it goes if it goes higher,
it becomes impossible.
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you going to make 10 kilos of 90
micron hash from a certain skewed within
[SPEAKER_17]: five percent of a range and then have the
province order more like a month later and
[SPEAKER_17]: say, well, we want double that.
[SPEAKER_17]: We want 20 kilos now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ontario saw what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: They want 30 kilos.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you make that happen?
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we need it right away.
[SPEAKER_17]: You get yourself into a situation where
you can't maintain the pathway.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and you have to do it in one batch,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't do it like like small artisans
who don't have the size of equipment that
[SPEAKER_13]: you have.
[SPEAKER_13]: They'd have to make that in 10 batches.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now there's just going to be
variation in those 10 batches where you
[SPEAKER_13]: have one big master batch because of the
size of your vessel.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's definitely challenging.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's definitely challenging.
[SPEAKER_17]: But Mike and I love a good challenge.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've been we've really been kind of
enjoying the journey.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is just the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I I am definitely going to get to a
place where I can have my own bubble man
[SPEAKER_17]: branded hash under micron specific,
you know, microns.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's just it's you know, it took me 30
years just to get to this might take some
[SPEAKER_17]: more months to get to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering maybe if we if we've
talked a lot about that to bring Alice
[SPEAKER_14]: into it and talk about what's happening in
California.
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of things are you having to get
through to get hash to the market in the
[SPEAKER_14]: current situation in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to say really quick,
adding on to what Mike was saying just for
[SPEAKER_00]: the listeners, when something is not
required, such as listing terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that means that, you know,
the small farmers and the small micro
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed people that are growing these
beautiful flowers or products would really
[SPEAKER_00]: like to have that listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pass it over to the LP and the LP
because it's not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just won't put it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really stand out at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the problems of, you know,
not not requiring it, because then the LPs
[SPEAKER_00]: have the power to decide what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I would love to hear from you,
Alice, as to what's going on in California
[SPEAKER_14]: and Flynn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, Flynn is better to answer
this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can talk about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you go first.
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at these two cuties.
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at these guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just relish in the cuteness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody decide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If Alice is taking a dab of other way and
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: California, I'm just hearing up here is
describing about Canada with packaging
[SPEAKER_05]: labeling requirements.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of that's very similar in
the new license space in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, kind of pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much labeled and package testing space.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, kind of of course,
you'd be plus or minus 10 percent final
[SPEAKER_05]: label.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was going to mention
incredibly difficult, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: for I mean, it seems like Canada kind of
took all the kind of greatest of kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of the states, including California,
and then kind of really went.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from from what I've seen,
there's definitely a lot more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's there's it makes it really,
really difficult for people to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: One have to work with incredibly dialed
lab that can kind of ensure that their
[SPEAKER_05]: quality and accuracy precision across time
can be able to be, you know, meet the
[SPEAKER_05]: labeling, you know, that, you know,
because if somebody does an R and D test
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of along the way and they find,
you know, kind of 75 percent have no
[SPEAKER_05]: content, you know, and they're going to
end up using that label they put in the
[SPEAKER_05]: final form.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it requires that, you know,
the trust and faith in the laboratory that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing testing with is going to be
able to even hit those kind of quality
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of plus or minus measurements.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five percent is incredibly close.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would imagine just on that level,
you know, kind of, you know, I seriously
[SPEAKER_05]: questioned how many labs are actually able
to be accurate, precise kind of in that
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, and then beyond that,
too, just the way Canada kind of really
[SPEAKER_05]: put, you know, you know, California,
I guess, like a lot of the pesticides and
[SPEAKER_05]: such you fail for, you know, have the
action limits established, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it seems like California or seems like
Canada took those action limits and
[SPEAKER_05]: severely made it tighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, from what I saw, it was about 10
part per billion is the average allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: level of what's going to create a fail,
which is on its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pushing the boundaries of analytical
chemistry's ability to test at those tiny
[SPEAKER_05]: levels, not to mention the accuracy and
precision that those labs are going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to kind of do on an ongoing level.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, I'd agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd agree with like everything,
everything you said for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a lot of it comes down to like
the cost of testing, the cost of putting
[SPEAKER_10]: your product in the marketplace and then
having to be really conscious of like the
[SPEAKER_10]: super high levels of taxes that your
product is going to have even before it
[SPEAKER_10]: hits the like retail level, so to speak,
because you'll be taxed at the
[SPEAKER_10]: distribution level.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you'll be taxed three different
times on the sales.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to be ultimately conscious
about when you're doing a batch and you
[SPEAKER_10]: have to pay for testing, how many dollars
or how many cents does that add to each
[SPEAKER_10]: unit?
[SPEAKER_10]: And keeping that cost to a minimum,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also a lot of the things are
really hard to control because you're
[SPEAKER_10]: forced to use other businesses that you
might not own or have control of through
[SPEAKER_10]: the line of products.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we need to use a distributor,
for example, to be able to sell our
[SPEAKER_10]: product to retailers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So since we don't have a distribution
license, I have to rely on someone else to
[SPEAKER_10]: handle our product correctly and actually
follow our SOPs for when it gets delivered
[SPEAKER_10]: to the retailer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then each retailer, too, has to know
how to like intake that product correctly,
[SPEAKER_10]: put it in the freezer, put it in the
refrigerator, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And keeping control of your product all
the way down to when the customer actually
[SPEAKER_10]: gets it is a lot harder in this system
that they've created.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for a full mount is crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like how hard it is for you to deliver.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just tough.
[SPEAKER_12]: Preserve like perfectly like heads full
mount for the final customers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I feel like a lot of kind of where
we've been moving in the market for
[SPEAKER_10]: California has been toward like a heavily
controlled like delivery service and more
[SPEAKER_10]: like a subscription service.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because with our product, it's really hard
to communicate to each individual retailer
[SPEAKER_10]: how to handle it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then each buyer, because let's say,
oh, you talk to the manager who's there on
[SPEAKER_10]: Monday, Wednesday and Friday, but then
your delivery comes in on Tuesday and the
[SPEAKER_10]: dude who's taking in your product,
you never talked to.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he never got communicated to how to
handle your specific product because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: so different.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then your product gets intake and then
sits on a shelf at like 80 degrees in
[SPEAKER_10]: their warehouse for like a week before the
other person realizes like, oh,
[SPEAKER_10]: my God, this should be in a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then you have like a kilo or two
product that essentially like almost got
[SPEAKER_10]: spoiled.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you have to take that hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Essentially decide, well, do we pull back
the product and you may be discounted?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we just not release it at all?
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, have to put it in maybe
edibles or something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But once it hits a certain level,
like once it gets past distribution,
[SPEAKER_10]: you can't pull it back always.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you either have to sell it or destroy
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So make some decision making very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely not easy the way we get
kind of pushed into these corners.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I remember the old corners with the
gun in the face, the 10 years to shoot
[SPEAKER_17]: your dog, the take your kids.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was definitely worse.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like this sucks.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can moan and whine and bitch about
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's not as bad as what it was just
like 10 plus years ago or whatever.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's still happening to a degree,
of course, but at least we have pathways.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're kind of having this conversation
in the room right now where people are
[SPEAKER_17]: saying, wow, lots of people are being kept
from the business.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like lots of people are kept from
everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: Every business.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because you grew weed and you paid
some of your bills does not give you the
[SPEAKER_17]: entitlement to automatically be involved
in a business that is a business.
[SPEAKER_17]: It still involves having to do all the
right moves.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still, you know, it's like anyone can
play to a degree, but you have people
[SPEAKER_17]: saying, oh, I'm going to need hundreds of
thousands of dollars if I want to get a
[SPEAKER_17]: license.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I would need millions of dollars if
I wanted to build houses and flip them.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have the skill.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have the money.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I avoid the business.
[SPEAKER_17]: Doesn't mean I don't want to be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Business.
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they keeping me out of that business
because I'm not in that business because I
[SPEAKER_17]: don't have millions of dollars to buy
homes and flip them on the.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'm kind of have a hard time with
that conversation where it's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: at what point do we let every single
person be a part of this business when
[SPEAKER_17]: it's not like that for any other business
in the world?
[SPEAKER_17]: You either find your way or you don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the big difference, though,
is you don't have the same financial tools
[SPEAKER_10]: that other businesses do in the in the in
the quote unquote mainstream society.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if I if you know, I have a college
education or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had experience and had worked under
someone, I could go out and get a loan to
[SPEAKER_10]: start a construction company.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, you could go and get a million
dollars from a bank as a normal person.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can do it as a cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_17]: Tons of people have done it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like in my country, we raised hundreds of
millions, billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_17]: You could have moved to Canada and started
your legal cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_17]: You live in North America.
[SPEAKER_17]: You could have easily come to Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could have gone to Canada,
though, when California alone is bigger
[SPEAKER_17]: than because they're limiting you.
[SPEAKER_17]: You just said they're not giving you the
ability that you can go and take a loan.
[SPEAKER_17]: So then you shift.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to be in this business up and
move to a whole new country.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, lots of people have done it,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're sitting next to a girl who
literally up and moved to a complete
[SPEAKER_17]: country and then married you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's true.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I mean, I feel like there are some
obstacles.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like as a legal business, you know,
like, I don't know, get a or like have a
[SPEAKER_12]: bank account, you know, like legal
businesses here have have a hard time
[SPEAKER_12]: having just a bank account, like a bank
that accepts like a legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the East Coast in a regulated
market, and it's just it's nearly
[SPEAKER_02]: impossible in terms of how where did your
money come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also agree with Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go where your opportunities are
and try to forge a pathway forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I firmly believe what Marcus believes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to find your path.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't have millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't invest millions of dollars to
start this company.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did it with knowledge and I connected
with people.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just, you know, it's just like,
of course, I want everyone to have the
[SPEAKER_17]: ability to do all the things that they
want to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I hear a lot of people complaining
that they're that they're being kept out
[SPEAKER_17]: of the industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, well, what does the industry
have to do like to to allow everyone to
[SPEAKER_17]: cut?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I've never been in an industry
that literally is open to any single
[SPEAKER_17]: person.
[SPEAKER_17]: Doesn't matter if you started a day ago
and have no information or no knowledge.
[SPEAKER_17]: You get to start a business in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's kind of crazy the levels of
entitlement that people are feeling in
[SPEAKER_17]: particular with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've I've never seen it with any other
business the way I've seen it with
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I you know, Marcus, the music industry
is kind of like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's all about your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about what you put into the thing
that you put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that what you're illustrating
is kind of just that is your knowledge and
[SPEAKER_02]: your passion, really, more importantly,
is what brought you to where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I share that same that same vision
with you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's only about, you know,
what you what you're passionate about and
[SPEAKER_02]: how you you kind of choose to go down that
pathway with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, banging our head against the
wall for 30 plus years.
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly nothing happened easily.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was arrested.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was put in jail.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I I felt all of these things that
people are saying that the industry did.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, like I caught charges.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had like all of these different things
happen to me.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just kind of worked through them and
I just traveled.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was my journey.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I definitely support people
in their journey.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a ton of people asking me all the
time, how do I break into this industry?
[SPEAKER_17]: How do I get into the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm always like, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, what's your passion?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like to me, cannabis is everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're a scientist, you can get into
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're, you know, like a cell biologist
or a tissue culture or, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: whatever it is, if you're if you're a
security guy that you've got a job in
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis, if you're, you know,
a grower or a processor, if you're an
[SPEAKER_17]: accountant, if you're part of leadership
and you want to be a CFO, are they so many
[SPEAKER_17]: different things you can do today that you
couldn't do 20 years ago in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: industry?
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's brought a lot of people into the
ability to be a part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, even if it's just like a laborer
and you want to learn how to grow in a
[SPEAKER_17]: greenhouse or you want to learn how to be
a lab tech, these things are kind of all
[SPEAKER_17]: available.
[SPEAKER_17]: And these were jobs that were not
available like 20 years ago in Canada.
[SPEAKER_17]: They just didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the fact that kids are excited to
go back to university sciences because
[SPEAKER_17]: they see positions are going to be opened
up for them and that they can,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, like, wow, this is opening up.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to go get my degree.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to come out and I'm going to be
a part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, I think all of that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I definitely have a hard time with
people.
[SPEAKER_17]: People in Canada for the longest time were
complaining about the micro grow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you got to have a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to have a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then some woman did it with like,
I don't know, like $50,000.
[SPEAKER_17]: And she was like, no, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_17]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, trust me, it's just, just instead of
complaining that it can't be done and
[SPEAKER_17]: creating problems for the solutions,
flip the script and create solutions for
[SPEAKER_17]: the problems because it can be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then although, you know, in California
and kind of across the United States,
[SPEAKER_05]: for that matter, you know, it's,
um, for Canada, legal cannabis markets,
[SPEAKER_05]: odds have, you know, with regulation been
put in place, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: streets funded groups to, you know,
and we've been able to find all that
[SPEAKER_05]: against the small guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also tremendous advantage,
you know, from a lot of what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, uh, you know, with the banks,
you know, banks are, is a whole definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've over the last,
uh, 11, 10 years, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we, we definitely had like 25 bank
accounts shut down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and so it's been a constant kind
of process to kind of roll through and
[SPEAKER_05]: find and, you know, work through this real
complicated space.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I mean, that's kind of the
journey, you know, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you have the passion, you'll find a
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so, you know, I do agree with,
you know, the complaint or problem,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, creating problems out of
existing problems or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just, uh, yeah, to, to find the way it's
like passion will find a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that everyone's trying to work
towards a better system because the
[SPEAKER_14]: system's oppressive and it makes it
incredibly difficult for people to enter
[SPEAKER_14]: the system, but big up to the people that
can, that can forge the way and make the
[SPEAKER_14]: changes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, maybe I'm thinking about this in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, here in the United States,
um, you know, if you go to indeed.com and
[SPEAKER_13]: you put cannabis extraction, you get a
never ending list of jobs and just about
[SPEAKER_13]: every state that has cannabis programs,
they need people, cannabis extraction,
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can go to these just job sites,
just to, you know, we were recently,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, looking to hire somebody and we were
thinking about, um, having like a
[SPEAKER_13]: full-time person to run our HPLC.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, uh, we looked and my God,
there had to be 15 other places looking
[SPEAKER_13]: for exactly the person that we were
looking for.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want someone that's, you know,
kind of analytically trained.
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't necessarily need to have a
college degree because we were paying them
[SPEAKER_13]: by the hour, but we wanted them to
basically take ownership over the HPLC and
[SPEAKER_13]: run our analytical in-house analytical
lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like there's a lot of jobs out
there right now for people who are looking
[SPEAKER_13]: for people to get into the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I, I don't know what, what,
what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, a lot of entry level jobs are out
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a lot of people that their
computers trying to wanting to be a part
[SPEAKER_17]: of things, but just not knowing how to
execute.
[SPEAKER_17]: And sometimes it's easier to just,
you know, I mean, listen, we're all having
[SPEAKER_17]: difficulties.
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't the easiest thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in a global pandemic.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all trying to deal with these
businesses.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're involved in something that's never
happened before in the world.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cannabis has never gone from a hundred
plus years, federally illegal to federally
[SPEAKER_17]: legal.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys down in the States are probably
going to pop federal here in the next two
[SPEAKER_17]: to five years.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's, it's almost inevitable.
[SPEAKER_17]: We hope so.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got to happen, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got to happen now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Will it happen the way we want it to
happen?
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll probably be scary.
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll probably be.
[SPEAKER_17]: Handed over to big business and pharma and
all these trap labs that think they're,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, GMP labs, but they aren't,
they're like bare arms, not wearing the
[SPEAKER_17]: proper gear.
[SPEAKER_17]: Those labs are going to go to the,
to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you're going to see the labs open up
with much more regulations.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's, it's a bit scary, but at the
same time, I run a lab like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what, like if I have to jump
through certain hoops to be a part of this
[SPEAKER_17]: industry, damn straight, I'm going to jump
through them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and one other And one one other
thing I'd like to add to that too is you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, because I feel like since over the
last 25 years You know in California with
[SPEAKER_05]: medical a medical program in place,
you know, it was in this time You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was probably one of the most unique
times of an industry of an emerging
[SPEAKER_05]: industry that will ever ever taking place
Will ever come it'll if there will ever be
[SPEAKER_05]: anything quite like it, but you know,
if you had five thousand dollars And you
[SPEAKER_05]: know some you know some gleam in your eye
and passion for the planet, you know You
[SPEAKER_05]: could kind of start up set up a garage
grow have ten lights, you know plus do
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever and be able to make Make a living
and make make a you know career at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time out of working with this plant,
you know And so that I feel like the
[SPEAKER_05]: stakes, you know with regulation kicking
in, you know kind of have made it as such
[SPEAKER_05]: that you know, the barrier of entry is
absolutely like greatly more expensive to
[SPEAKER_05]: get in because of All the reality of
compliance and regulation all the things
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, that was the most I feel
like that's the most unfettered capitalism
[SPEAKER_05]: like free market that that we could have
ever been part of you know, just working
[SPEAKER_05]: with this plant the time before
legalization and so I feel like that's
[SPEAKER_05]: where so many people kind of you know have
been cut out because they You know how
[SPEAKER_05]: were were once an owner operator of a
business now trick, you know kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: grumpy and jaded, you know because they
didn't You know necessarily do their
[SPEAKER_05]: diligence to stack money, you know,
like you not take the you know outrageous
[SPEAKER_05]: vacations all over the world all the time,
you know, because for those that saw that
[SPEAKER_05]: time is time of proving ground to like
work out the train, you know, the the
[SPEAKER_05]: proof of concept and and the ability to
sustain and not just break even each row
[SPEAKER_05]: or each kind of rounds but but eventually
stack over time point where they could get
[SPEAKER_05]: into a position where they could help sell
funds and You know kind of a project to
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of become licensed but do the fact
that you know kind of that didn't happen,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I feel like a lot of people kind
of they see like they got cut out but You
[SPEAKER_05]: know and in a bit of a way they did,
you know because the barrier of entry and
[SPEAKER_05]: financial Investments kind of went so much
greater.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but that was also you know,
you got it all they all everybody else
[SPEAKER_05]: asked that recognize that themselves You
know, there was there was that was the
[SPEAKER_05]: time, you know, and once legalizations
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not I mean All that work to get ready
for this moment There's also the fact that
[SPEAKER_17]: a lot of these people were just so stoked
on selling four and five and six thousand
[SPEAKER_17]: dollar pounds and eighty dollar eights
under the guise of medical Where it's like
[SPEAKER_17]: the vacations and the cars and all of the
things that these people gained through
[SPEAKER_17]: this prohibition pricing was like You know
how many of them want to sell eighty
[SPEAKER_17]: dollar eights instead of like,
you know Give those eights away or sell
[SPEAKER_17]: them for ten or fifty It turns into that
too there was like, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_17]: people now are like fucked cannabis It's
like well, yeah, I guess you're not
[SPEAKER_17]: getting your four or five thousand US
dollars a pound anymore I could see where
[SPEAKER_17]: you fuck the legal cannabis business
because the illegal cannabis business was
[SPEAKER_17]: so good to you Unfortunately, instead of
just people having shitty jobs that
[SPEAKER_17]: weren't paying them enough It actually
involved locking up hundreds of thousands
[SPEAKER_17]: of people around the world.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I gotta lean back
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that Josh I'm just saying you can't
say it was good for a thousand But then it
[SPEAKER_14]: was not good since you were getting a gun
to your head I think it's just evolving
[SPEAKER_14]: now and it's really important for us to
stay calm and try and help everyone wants
[SPEAKER_14]: to enter You know enter which is what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're showing people Different levels of
entry happening right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's different levels of play happening
and you know, let's let's try and keep
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis sacred and try and keep a soul in
cannabis and move forward I think Alice
[SPEAKER_00]: had something I and I so I just wanted to
say that you know Marcus what what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about is representative to The
experience that you're having in the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that you know, maybe your
friends are having so you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're speaking for what's happening Your
involvement and that's all that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: speak for so, you know what you are saying
I can't at all, you know a lot Of it can't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily transfer to a cultivator in
the experiences that we've had in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry working our asses off to try to
be a part of it, you know or recognizing
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the reality that this is the system
that because we are so Integral in working
[SPEAKER_00]: with plant medicine that it might not want
to be an industry that we actually enter
[SPEAKER_00]: into so there's that incredible push and
pull to so here as cultivators were
[SPEAKER_00]: working with incredible integrity and what
we see when we put it out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: universe is like all this other mishmash
and maybe You know, it doesn't totally
[SPEAKER_00]: match that energy So there's a lot going
on here and I just wanted to mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of us have our own individual
experiences in the industry, so because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's evolving Everything is going to come
to the table all at once And that's what's
[SPEAKER_12]: happening right now Subject to that is I
mean continuing what Kelly was saying that
[SPEAKER_12]: it's actually about privilege I mean I can
talk through my own experience as you
[SPEAKER_12]: could talk through your own Marcus like in
Brazil as I told before here I'm a
[SPEAKER_12]: privileged white girl, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have the standpoint of view from a
privileged white girl in Brazil here in
[SPEAKER_12]: United States.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I managed to travel in between these
two places in the world like how I see
[SPEAKER_12]: myself and how I recognize myself and
Being able to be part of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: industry at least in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see a possibility for everyone I
don't see something that would be almost
[SPEAKER_12]: married married to critical.
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you say that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I don't see it like that I see it as
something that would do would totally do
[SPEAKER_12]: with privilege all the business owners
here at least that I see here in
[SPEAKER_12]: California, they're white.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see black people.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see Latinos.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see people there are from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I feel like Yeah, it's not for every
it's not every person that has a place in
[SPEAKER_17]: this business, honestly That's like every
business.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's true 100% every business but there's
a difference between the cannabis business
[SPEAKER_12]: and every other businesses in the world we
live in the prohibitionist society and
[SPEAKER_12]: this business that we have nowadays has a
historical reparation to take care of
[SPEAKER_12]: different than other businesses like
people in the last like 50 60 years people
[SPEAKER_12]: have been massive incarcerated all over
the world through like a drug policy and
[SPEAKER_12]: Where I where I agree with you is that
with regulations things are safer This is
[SPEAKER_12]: where this is where I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are good good good sides and bad
sides To like not everyone can be part of
[SPEAKER_12]: it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time look safer,
you know, there's less criminality So it's
[SPEAKER_12]: just I just wanted to shine a light on
this because it's important for us to
[SPEAKER_12]: recognize our own privileges and
Understand that yeah for I mean for me I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: finding my place here in United States,
too But I feel it that if I was like a
[SPEAKER_12]: black girl that would be totally different
and that would be way harder It would be
[SPEAKER_12]: way harder to find opportunity If you want
to have a ton of great conversations about
[SPEAKER_17]: this very conversation and dr. Allison
mentioned it at the start of the show this
[SPEAKER_17]: is happening on Clubhouse like every day
every minute huge groups of people talking
[SPEAKER_17]: about this both from From the minority
perspective from the privilege perspective
[SPEAKER_17]: both in the room simultaneously and it's
really really great conversation to be a
[SPEAKER_17]: part of And it's it's of course true and
it's not just the cannabis business
[SPEAKER_17]: believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's happening in a ton of different kinds
of businesses privilege passes through
[SPEAKER_17]: more than just the cannabis business and
the best thing we can do is recognize our
[SPEAKER_17]: privilege do the best that we can to Share
it with those who don't have that
[SPEAKER_17]: privilege, you know I share my time and my
energy with everyone regardless of what
[SPEAKER_17]: they look like regardless of what color
their skin is I'm always willing to help
[SPEAKER_17]: and share my time with people and and and
you know It's what we're doing right now
[SPEAKER_17]: today.
[SPEAKER_17]: This show is certainly not for any one
group of people This show is for every
[SPEAKER_17]: people, you know, all the people can
listen to hash church and hopefully,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know Enjoy the conversation and have
some disagreements and have some agreeance
[SPEAKER_17]: to me Some of the best hash churches is
when it gets a little rocky and we have a
[SPEAKER_17]: little we get into the core subjects where
there's really some nerves being poked and
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll tell you when we started talking
about this The chat room started going off
[SPEAKER_17]: in on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like And sometimes it goes pretty
slow.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, people want to have these
difficult conversations and kind of and
[SPEAKER_17]: there's learning from them like I have
these conversations so I can personally
[SPEAKER_17]: learn from them so I can shift my
perspective so I can you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: help help become a better person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, look, I'm a legacy operator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also man of white privilege,
but I use my white privilege to for
[SPEAKER_03]: further the issue as well as advance the
issue because I knew My friends of color
[SPEAKER_03]: were not able to do so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hired my friends of color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hire of all different color creeds every
spectrum of the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We became a support network for many trans
employees going each direction and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: been an absolutely wonderful embracing
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know early on we were activists.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all expecting to get arrested
every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't until the laws changed that,
you know, So yeah, I understand my white
[SPEAKER_03]: privilege is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentor many people for free because I
want them to learn and give the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities and get the opportunities
that know they don't longer have to
[SPEAKER_03]: trailblaze for there's a whole bunch of
shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We as we say, we built the airplane while
flying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you make a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You build extra wings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do all kinds of stupid shit because
again early on we hired activists because
[SPEAKER_03]: again any day we're all expecting to go to
jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now 20 years down the line that hasn't
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we continue to send the elevator down
through education through mentoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I contribute to Supernova women,
which is education as well as uplifting
[SPEAKER_03]: women of color in our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mentored various people across
various spectrums because I feel it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: duty as operators for us to still foster
the environment that we want to see that
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to see because we have I stepped
down from the National Canvas Industries
[SPEAKER_03]: Association because I wanted more people
of color and more diversity on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use my privilege to step down to
promote that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there's a chance and it's it's no
type of guilt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a realization that we have to
be what we want the world to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never we were told 30 years ago it was
never going to happen in our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are doing what we're doing and
that law has changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it perfect?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we still have to work on change here
in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to fight for SB 34 to get the
ability to still give away free cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: to people of low income.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and that was hard to get support
around and to rally people around because
[SPEAKER_03]: again, people become complacent on
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are valid and real discussions
that should be had because we need
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to not only have equality,
but we have to have equity for those that
[SPEAKER_03]: were most hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need black, brown color people,
veterans of all that have been hurt by
[SPEAKER_03]: this drug war to get a chance to get an
equal footing because it's we're losing it
[SPEAKER_03]: fast to these huge corporations coming out
of Canada and these conglomerates building
[SPEAKER_03]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: That if we don't do something soon,
there's going to be no opportunity because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just going to be 7-elevens and
Walmarts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying of cannabis per
se as opposed to mom and pop operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of a niche of where we are
and where we've had to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to risk our freedoms to change law
for dispensaries, but sooner or later
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries are going to be a thing of
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be able to go to your
Costco and get your low, mid and high
[SPEAKER_03]: grade and they'll be specialty shops and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things needed for medical, but I'll be
honest and say we had our time,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had our space, but change is coming and
we're now going to be so normalized that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to be pushed out of existence
because we're no longer pushing the
[SPEAKER_03]: envelope.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're no longer risking ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've changed the conversation forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm fine with being obsolete because I
know we've changed it forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: In large Costco-sized containers,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they'll still be craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, look, Humboldt and Medicino
will be just like Napa.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have their craft places,
but it's just going to become like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be, mail order will be normalized
here eventually in America and they'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: just farms large enough to support mail
order because they've got a unique,
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing genetic that grow in an amazing
way, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's going to become a normal
commodity is what it will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll become more skeptical of going
to Costco for your, you know, your big
[SPEAKER_03]: Costco.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe they'll have amazing weed back,
you know, that I don't know the quality is
[SPEAKER_03]: getting better, but you know, the larger
it gets, it doesn't mean the better it
[SPEAKER_03]: gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we've always felt back on
craft and why Napa Valley is so prominent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still to this day and millions of
people come through a year because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: small wineries that do nothing but mail
order or sell directly right out of their
[SPEAKER_03]: winery.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need to sell to the large box
stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas people are scaling up to be in the
box stores right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are scaling up for interstate
commerce right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does that make the mom and pop
store when you've got these huge
[SPEAKER_03]: conglomerates that can literally buy up
your entire state's dispensaries just like
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, you know, this brings up a good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the thing I wanted to just talk about
is, is the idea of standardizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's really what we're talking
about in terms of scaling and Mark's
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark's got us touched on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mark, you've touched on this a bunch
where CGMP is going to be the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but I, I think we're a long
ways away from this and I'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam's thoughts on, you know, the genetic
aspect of this, because if they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when this gets federally United
States, it's going to be a whole new world
[SPEAKER_02]: of federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have varietals that are
going to need to be certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be specific ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to, you know, there's a lot
of checks and balances that I foresee us
[SPEAKER_02]: having to, to kind of get involved in,
in, in a new way, just like we had to get
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in testing in a new way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a cultivator, you've never had
someone tell you, you can't sell your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis before you just never,
never had that or your hash or your
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts, you know, like never,
never had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ceiling is going to get,
I think is going to get even lower and
[SPEAKER_02]: tighter and the box is going to get
tighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to come down to being
really good at going through these,
[SPEAKER_02]: the navigating these CGMP slash,
you know, clean room slash, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever else you want to want to call it,
you know, rules that are going to be put
[SPEAKER_02]: in place and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where it's going to
start separating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Marcus has been saying, the
individuals that really understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: processes and the, the, the, you know,
intricacies and the steps in between the
[SPEAKER_02]: steps versus those who are, you know,
just the, you know, it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to hear Mark's thoughts on
this and ATN, like you sounds like you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've already been thinking a lot about
this, you know, as I have, I've been kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of thinking about, Oh my gosh,
you know, I've been here for two decades,
[SPEAKER_02]: been, you know, over two decades working
with this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean for us in,
you know, in the next decade?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I see dispensaries becoming
less and less.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once normalization happens, why can't,
I mean, right now in New York bodegas are
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, Hey, if they can sell cigarettes
and alcohol, why can't they sell cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're totally right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody is going to test that water in
one of these states because they're all
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laboratories and somebody is going to say,
yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it becomes normally and accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I wish, look, I wish I could say
we'll be around forever, but I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you really look at
normalization and acceptance of society,
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're even talking about here with
the new politicians here in the U S a more
[SPEAKER_03]: act, which will give us banking and other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to look 20 years down the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, just like alcohol and tobacco,
I can go down to my local seven 11 and
[SPEAKER_03]: pick up some, you know, Jack Herrera or 20
pack or, you know, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as, as frightening as that thought may be,
why can't that be an accepted
[SPEAKER_03]: normalization?
[SPEAKER_03]: We drained, you know, Oh, they would one
day be places you could go and buy pot,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not only one kind of pot, but
different kinds of pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used to laugh and go, ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that because the risks are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if society accepts it and every state
now legalizes it, why won't it be
[SPEAKER_03]: distributed?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like ABC stores or something like
that, because of the want or need for the
[SPEAKER_03]: taxation and how narrow those margins
become, because it's a race to the bottom,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's an agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once these States come online,
there's going to be some amazing growers
[SPEAKER_03]: in certain regions that are going to do
amazing things on mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be able to challenge the
market at ways that we've never seen
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not there yet, but I don't think
we're a decade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, yeah, we're already seeing CBD
products being sold in convenience stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what, what's going to happen
across North America, especially across
[SPEAKER_04]: the States is you're going to,
right now, a lot of the States are
[SPEAKER_04]: fragmented and they're state by state
regulation of THC products into the kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of patchwork framework of different state
licenses that are either THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: As federal law changes, I have to assume
that federal law will evolve in a similar
[SPEAKER_04]: fashion in the way the Canadian,
it will first pass some sort of federal
[SPEAKER_04]: interstate medical, and then they'll pass
some sort of federal interstate
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll when they change THC
cannabinoids from schedule one to either
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule two or preferably schedule three
or off the scheduling, but when they
[SPEAKER_04]: reschedule it, it'll probably open up for
the FDA to start regulating any company
[SPEAKER_04]: that wants to do interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_04]: That interstate commerce means that,
Hey, now I can sell to any state,
[SPEAKER_04]: any consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can ship to the East coast as many
people may have been doing in the
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional market, but in order to get
that interstate commerce license,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to have to be able to meet
the FDA's rules and requirements about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of depends on how they're
going to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it goes schedule two, it's going to
have to be produced in essentially a
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's schedule three, we hopefully will
be able to have food grade facilities here
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a GPP facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is much, it's very similar to a food
grade facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just very heavily regulated on all
the documentation that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're being able to sterilize every
surface and clean every piece of
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to have every SOP, PCP,
which is a preventative control plan and a
[SPEAKER_04]: list of a dozen other documents on every
piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing's going to happen with the,
when the FDA gets involved in the States
[SPEAKER_04]: and when any other country starts
regulating inter-provincial or interstate
[SPEAKER_04]: sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people who, you know, previously were
blasting in their backyard shed probably
[SPEAKER_04]: won't be able to, because they'll have to
be able to prove that they can clean that
[SPEAKER_04]: building.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a barn, maybe you can
renovate that farm to a food grade
[SPEAKER_04]: facility, but you're going to have to be
able to build it in a way and that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: actually show to the regulators that they
can be sterilized.
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to minimize the risk of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be pathways.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be, you know,
something that, you know, the first time
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's done is always the most
difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as, as the licenses open up that,
you know, ever, I think everyone's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to learn from everyone else and
be able to see that, yes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like the wine industry, the hops
industry, there are ways that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivate cannabis not only on the small
acreage, a couple hundred plant scale,
[SPEAKER_04]: but all the way up to the hectare scales
and do it in a sustainable fashion.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to make sure that,
you know, it doesn't happen with,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what happened to tobacco?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you take this sacred plant that
every person grew that was good for the
[SPEAKER_14]: earth that was used during ceremony.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you just, what?
[SPEAKER_14]: We regulate it.
[SPEAKER_14]: What?
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone's growing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: What?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's at all the stores.
[SPEAKER_14]: What?
[SPEAKER_14]: It has no life.
[SPEAKER_14]: What?
[SPEAKER_14]: It creates cancer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that we, as in order for us to
keep our consciousness as we move forward,
[SPEAKER_14]: let's just make sure that cannabis doesn't
become pharma to table.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it keeps farm to table.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that maybe if it does go big and it
does go box store and it does go all that
[SPEAKER_14]: way, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's going to be back to the micro
brew or the micro weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or the farmer's market to where someone
that wants to stay with the intention and
[SPEAKER_14]: still provide something clean and
acceptable for use by humans can still
[SPEAKER_14]: have that personal connection.
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe it's, you know, partly a tourism
thing and it's more experiential.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can use our gardens to heal
people just walking through them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So as we move forward with this
legalization, let's keep that space open
[SPEAKER_14]: for, you know, for the small scale
cultivator to be able to continue to
[SPEAKER_14]: uphold like the quality.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause no matter what, when you put it into
a box, you know, and there may be
[SPEAKER_14]: inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's be so bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be so bold to say let's hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot about like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's in these signed ledgers and
we've got our lawyers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a conscious awakening miracle
healing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is so alive in the cannabis
culture that it's absolutely imperative
[SPEAKER_00]: that we, as people who have been the
medicine makers and the people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten it to this point, still continue to
push that rhetoric, that education,
[SPEAKER_00]: that energy forward, that you know,
we don't want to de-sacred the plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that tobacco was like Josh was
just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sketchy place.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a cannabis community, as we move
forward internationally, we're also
[SPEAKER_14]: opening doorways for other psychedelic
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't want psychedelic plant
medicine to also fall in the hands of
[SPEAKER_14]: regulation and into the hands that goes
away from the origins of the magic of what
[SPEAKER_14]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we, the medicine makers of cannabis
do have an incredible responsibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going to happen with plant
medicine in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Josh was just saying, we are holding
the door open to many plant medicines in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future and what's going to happen to
these conscious raising plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've helped us so much in humanity gain
traction on an awakening of different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels and here we are at another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we need to, you know,
carry that voice of the spirituality of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the sacred commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right on, that dialogue has to be
woven into the fabric of where this is
[SPEAKER_02]: headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get nervous that it's being left
behind and let's face it, corporate
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, whatever you want to call this,
the dry cure process is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all can agree here, you know,
out in the open market, it's always the
[SPEAKER_02]: craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the people that have that deep
understanding of the process and that
[SPEAKER_02]: connection with the plant spiritually that
allows it to really resonate in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: its flavor profile, the timing in which
they're dry curing it and how it's trimmed
[SPEAKER_02]: and when it's trimmed and all the steps in
the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a deep connection that goes
beyond any SOP, beyond any type of title,
[SPEAKER_02]: any paycheck and anything that goes along
with any of the things that we call an
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: An industry is something that we're as
humans trying to better understand to call
[SPEAKER_02]: it something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just face it guys, it's passion
that is the cornerstone of all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is a human minded creation
that's ever evolving and changing because
[SPEAKER_00]: humans are ever evolving and changing in
this weird mind that we create on what
[SPEAKER_00]: standards are at one particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this plant is constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are of course interacting with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are of course changing maybe its
frequency level, but this is a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been here, you know, for an
incredibly long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way to where we have an
endocannabinoid system that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there needs to be some kind of a respect
in that also.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a question.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, a question from Sasa Serbin.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you wanted to quickly answer that one,
drag and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we definitely do grow some some
wormwood and we get Artemisia down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake in the area that we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of down at lake level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find it wild crafted and we
definitely work with it on different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels for parasitical cleanses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure I appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to jump in kind of just on
this thought too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, I did mention kind of a
bit of this last week, I believe,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, kind of it's fascinating
that you know, with prohibition ending and
[SPEAKER_05]: all the money coming in and all everybody
trying to come and find their stake in
[SPEAKER_05]: this new industry, you know, it's
fascinating and how different it is from
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol because, you know, with alcohol,
you know, when prohibition ended,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there was the development of the
big, you know, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: however many decades and decades later
that the craft and the craft industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: spirit industry really started thriving,
you know, but with cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's, you know, with prohibition
ending, there's this effort for corporate
[SPEAKER_05]: coming in consolidation to occur
simultaneously with the development of the
[SPEAKER_05]: craft industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, like just to the higher
intelligence of the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's so much, you know, there's so,
so many barriers to the barriers of entry
[SPEAKER_05]: that the plant itself puts up for people
to even succeed in working with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't like spent your,
you know, so much of your own time and
[SPEAKER_05]: passion, you know, like appreciating it
and coming to respect it, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in all the different lessons the plant
will teach us in cultivation and hash
[SPEAKER_05]: making.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the built up like tribal knowledge
from the culture and from the craft
[SPEAKER_05]: industry is something that, you know,
you can't just learn, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so you see kind of simultaneously
with, you know, everybody going licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of, you know, finding their way
in this new space.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of fear that it's
going to be like alcohol and there's just
[SPEAKER_05]: going to consolidate a few brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all this, but, you know, I,
you know, just, just kind of pointing out
[SPEAKER_05]: from the testing side of things,
it's like, you know, I've seen some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: most, the largest and most like
catastrophic fails happen from like a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of the biggest money people coming in
just, you know, recklessly thinking
[SPEAKER_05]: they're just going to come take over the
plant and take over the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they plant, you know, puts them in a
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and so many of the people that are
growing around ag lands and it's all kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of popping dirty, you know, and,
and, and in the same while, all the
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers in Northern California and around
areas that have preserved the craft and
[SPEAKER_05]: the integrity of this plant and not poison
their land and poison the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are advantages in this market where
there's, I mean, everybody's looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: clean, abundant quality material to make
into products and, and jar up and to do
[SPEAKER_05]: all the things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but for what it's worth, it's a,
it's a unicorn, you know, the amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: material that's out in the market,
you know, that's being cultivated.
[SPEAKER_05]: In these areas that are dirty is,
is greatly exceeds the clean supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, I, I mean, I hope it's
not naive to think, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimately, you know, it's like,
you know, cause everybody wants,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's like, it's like stain your
lane and enter your zone and don't get
[SPEAKER_05]: like freaked out by like the fact that
there's these
agendas.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're breaking up, pal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the knowledge, you know,
that you do in my, you know, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I see it's not an easy plan to learn
unless you really respect it and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm just, yeah, just, just wanted to
make a point that, you know, I think the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant's intelligence is going to serve us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, for those that have been in services
plant all their life there's I feel deeply
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's the plant's got your back you
know as long as you just keep your passion
[SPEAKER_05]: and find your way and don't get freaked
out about the corporate agendas and all
[SPEAKER_05]: this because it's not like they're
figuring out any quicker and if anything
[SPEAKER_05]: their levels of face plant are that much
out of such a greater magnitude that you
[SPEAKER_05]: know are crippling in a lot of in so many
of the cases and so yeah I just got a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of trust and faith that the plant's gonna
have our back and that the craft farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: and the craft artisan producers are going
to find their way as long as they keep
[SPEAKER_17]: their passion and push forward seems like
at least here in British Columbia more and
[SPEAKER_17]: more happening I see people that I know
that are getting their you know micro
[SPEAKER_17]: licenses I saw Patrick one of our
glassblowers who got his license recently
[SPEAKER_17]: and he was just blowing glass one day and
the next year he was announcing that he
[SPEAKER_17]: was building out his facility and that he
got his license and I was just so happy to
[SPEAKER_17]: see that I know the great gardeners
working on the same thing with Kirk to sod
[SPEAKER_17]: and it seems like there are people who are
are getting through and I know those are
[SPEAKER_17]: the people that will kind of help the next
group of people you know where it's like
[SPEAKER_17]: it's not this fear and scarcity vibe where
it's like if we make it down a pathway
[SPEAKER_17]: people are pretty much happy to share you
know the the methods of how they did it
[SPEAKER_17]: and how they got there and from a
processing standpoint we're very excited
[SPEAKER_17]: to you know find more and more
relationships with craft growers because
[SPEAKER_17]: they grow exceptional quality cannabis
they get their terpenes up there a little
[SPEAKER_17]: higher than some of the terpene contents
we're seeing out of the large license
[SPEAKER_17]: production facilities and it's we're
excited to see all these great growers
[SPEAKER_17]: that we've known for you know decades
slowly making the that switch and it's not
[SPEAKER_17]: an easy switch you know I know that Kelly
and Josh mentioned it earlier you know is
[SPEAKER_17]: it an industry we want to be a part of in
that particular or do we want to you know
[SPEAKER_17]: and it's all that it's very much a fence
sitting position but it's very much the
[SPEAKER_17]: human nature to consistently divide and if
you just take the fence away you realize
[SPEAKER_17]: you're actually just in a field of grass
and it's kind of green over there and it's
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of green over there and you have a
lot more motion to move and you can tap
[SPEAKER_17]: into a lot more people if you just take
that fence down and just just Mark isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: it true like in Canada right now there's a
surplus of one million pounds on the shelf
[SPEAKER_17]: of the producers it's definitely possible
if you're producing sub quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: and you're trying to race to the bottom
and produce cannabis that has you know
[SPEAKER_17]: like less than a percentage of terpenes
and it's just not very exciting in flavor
[SPEAKER_17]: not to mention if it sits in your vault
for a year and you lose that 0.7 percent
[SPEAKER_17]: terpenes that you actually had there and
now it's basically distillate sitting on a
[SPEAKER_17]: plant you know diluted distillate on a on
a plant matter but you know that that
[SPEAKER_17]: doesn't surprise me it's kind of like
there's always been a surplus of swag more
[SPEAKER_06]: and more of the Canadian total that's
produced under licenses is grown outdoors
[SPEAKER_17]: now yeah there that's true too a couple of
key companies just got some big outdoor
[SPEAKER_17]: licenses just a couple of years ago and
that really you know you saw 10 acres here
[SPEAKER_17]: and five acres there and then all of a
sudden 48 north did 77 acres which was
[SPEAKER_17]: unbelievable i talked to the kid who
planted all those plants he wasn't even 30
[SPEAKER_17]: years old he popped like 228 000 seedlings
and and like i just had to give and he was
[SPEAKER_17]: like you know and i walked through the
field and some of it didn't look that good
[SPEAKER_17]: and some of it did look good and of course
people were you know slamming all over
[SPEAKER_17]: them i actually you know it was one of the
things because josh and kelly aren't in
[SPEAKER_17]: the industry and when i went to visit that
facility instead of like taking a bunch of
[SPEAKER_17]: pictures and blasting them on the internet
i thought i'll try to help this company
[SPEAKER_17]: there's a few key things and i hooked them
up with sean from los gardens and i was
[SPEAKER_17]: like sean is like dem pure certified he's
willing to help he lives less than an hour
[SPEAKER_17]: away maybe this is a way to sort of build
a bridge and help a company rather than
[SPEAKER_17]: like kind of pour gas on it light it and
then sit there and enjoy it while it burns
[SPEAKER_17]: down to the ground so i just sort of
thought like well why don't we just kind
[SPEAKER_17]: of help the company and it's easy to be a
critic but it's kind of like i think it's
[SPEAKER_17]: better to help and to kind of like get
that information that josh and kelly are
[SPEAKER_17]: sitting on and i always am begging them
try to figure out a way to get involved
[SPEAKER_17]: within this system because the system
really needs you and the change that
[SPEAKER_17]: you're doing outside of the system is
incredible but the change that you could
[SPEAKER_17]: do within the system system systematically
like that is to me i think it would be
[SPEAKER_17]: substantial and that's kind of what i'm
trying to do myself thank you that's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome and i think i just wanted to you
know be a little bit more accurate with
[SPEAKER_00]: language is that we're here to help the
plant we're not necessarily here to help
[SPEAKER_00]: the system so our we're gonna continue to
be a voice for the plant we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to educate for the plant we're
not really interested necessarily in
[SPEAKER_00]: educating or helping out the system
because it's ever changing us entering in
[SPEAKER_00]: the system as we're entering in the system
with just like you said bits and pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: education and and as far as like burning
down another facility that's growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: real question is is if we're helping the
plant and not the system of course we
[SPEAKER_00]: would come in and educate that huge
massive organization or lp or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it that's really having a
wrongful relationship with this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: having a hard time cultivating it this is
where we can step in and say oh well our
[SPEAKER_00]: true alliance is with the plant and and i
think that we're just going to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: have that pure alliance with the plant
rather than have an alliance with this
[SPEAKER_14]: ever-changing system and that's all and i
love that point thank you and then that's
[SPEAKER_14]: why i value the show mark us and again
just thank you for putting this on because
[SPEAKER_14]: it's these conversations you know there's
a little bit of everything happening so we
[SPEAKER_14]: get to all see what's happening and i like
that there's people in different areas of
[SPEAKER_14]: the world in different areas so that we
get to share our experience and i consider
[SPEAKER_14]: it the richness of the show so i thank you
for this conversation and our experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant is awesome because with den
pure and what josh and i do is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: having a global experience with the plant
we can't be caught in one u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: system one canadian system one australian
system one brazilian system we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate all of what humanity is going
through and still continue the education
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and the in the information you
know dedicated to the plant because the
[SPEAKER_00]: systems like i said are ever-changing so
so that's our focus very well said and i
[SPEAKER_17]: appreciate your perspective absolutely and
it is definitely a language thing for sure
[SPEAKER_17]: i just uh you know i and you are helping
within the system because the people
[SPEAKER_17]: you're helping are choosing to work within
that system and they're bringing some of
[SPEAKER_17]: that information to the system and it's uh
it is what it is you know um i just love
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis i want it to be successful
regardless of i want my mother to be able
[SPEAKER_17]: to buy her medicine online the way she
prefers to you know she doesn't want to go
[SPEAKER_17]: to dispensaries she doesn't want to go to
the gray market she likes to just go to a
[SPEAKER_17]: company that she can look up and see the
people that work there and know that it's
[SPEAKER_17]: getting tested and all of these things and
there are millions of people like her and
[SPEAKER_17]: without that particular system they would
be left out in the cold and there's a
[SPEAKER_17]: there's an enormous amount of systems you
know in that sense it's not just a
[SPEAKER_17]: canadian and a brazilian it's just all of
these you know platforms that the plant is
[SPEAKER_17]: finding itself in uh it's very you know it
used to be in a prohibition platform and
[SPEAKER_17]: believe it or not we all supported that
system whether we like to admit it or not
[SPEAKER_17]: it was the system we we worked within it
was the prohibition system it was the
[SPEAKER_17]: system we had to work within and i'm i'm
certain it's the system that allowed
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis to be sold for five and six and
seven thousand u.s dollars a pound in
[SPEAKER_17]: places like manhattan and los angeles you
know that was the system and now it's not
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of the system anymore and it's sort
of changing and there are growing pains
[SPEAKER_17]: and some people are feeling a little like
the grounds moving out from under them
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of like the home dealer felt when the
dispensaries came out you know the bc
[SPEAKER_17]: compassion club and all of these spots had
no idea they were going to absolutely
[SPEAKER_17]: decimate the home dealer the mom and pop
dealers that were just sitting at home
[SPEAKER_17]: paying their mortgage by selling eights
they couldn't compete with dispensaries
[SPEAKER_17]: there's 25 different kinds of weed at a
tans dispensary there's like 30 different
[SPEAKER_17]: kinds of concentrates he had put all that
stuff into one amazing place and he
[SPEAKER_17]: created this incredible environment for
people to come to but on the flip side
[SPEAKER_17]: there were probably a lot of people in
that area that were selling weed that
[SPEAKER_17]: suddenly that dried up for them so there
goes another you know one system comes
[SPEAKER_17]: into place another system dries up and it
just keeps going and going and going and
[SPEAKER_17]: all we can do is try and stay conscious
and try and make sure that we you know
[SPEAKER_17]: direct this in some form or another that
is you know like kelly and josh are saying
[SPEAKER_17]: like plant-based for the for the plant
actually they showed up in our lounge and
[SPEAKER_03]: would sell it in our smoking lounge so you
know you'd be amazed dog you know uh
[SPEAKER_03]: they're still resourceful the traditional
market remains traditionally unique and
[SPEAKER_03]: will always find ways to survive no matter
what happens no matter what transpired i
[SPEAKER_03]: mean look 80 of the regulated market prior
to 64 disappeared you know and is now back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the traditional market so the
traditional market is way bigger than the
[SPEAKER_03]: legal market hands down and that's not
changing anytime soon so being a scientist
[SPEAKER_13]: i try to understand systems right in in
general and and and what i could tell you
[SPEAKER_13]: is that yeah systems are a man-made
construct but that they can evolve kelly
[SPEAKER_13]: and so like humans can steer a system so
we can steer a system because we are the
[SPEAKER_13]: system if you think about it like yeah so
like people have asked this before you
[SPEAKER_13]: know the cannabis industry you know
industry i always thought of like as a kid
[SPEAKER_13]: is like you know the industrial revolution
like smokestacks and factories and workers
[SPEAKER_13]: and unions that's that's industry the
cannabis industry is really just an
[SPEAKER_13]: illusion if you think about it because all
it is is we're okay like collin said yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: we're attracted to the plant and like our
passion for the plant gets pulled through
[SPEAKER_13]: in these products and i think at some
point like marcus made some hash right and
[SPEAKER_13]: he's like man this is really good and his
friends all got around and was like that's
[SPEAKER_13]: really really good hash boy wouldn't it be
great to someday produce this and bring
[SPEAKER_13]: this to the masses and the thing when we
were talking about cgmp so just so
[SPEAKER_13]: everyone knows gmp stands for good
manufacturing practices and c there's
[SPEAKER_13]: usually a little prefix of c before that
and little c stands for current because
[SPEAKER_13]: those are constantly changing like systems
they're constantly changing yes there's
[SPEAKER_13]: systems that are in place but ultimately
these are systems constructed by humans
[SPEAKER_13]: run by humans and for the benefit of
humans and so when i think of cgmp and we
[SPEAKER_13]: we think of it in the industry in the
industry there you go again the people who
[SPEAKER_13]: work in this business as being something
related to quality and quality control and
[SPEAKER_13]: safety but what i can tell you is that the
owners the people who who own these
[SPEAKER_13]: businesses the shareholders what they
think of when they think about cgmp is
[SPEAKER_13]: risk management right so if they're going
to be producing a product and they're
[SPEAKER_13]: going to be producing x kilograms of that
product and that's a lot of money and a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot of labor and a lot of electricity and
a huge investment going into making this
[SPEAKER_13]: product what they want to what they want
to run the what they don't want to run the
[SPEAKER_13]: risk of is that product all fouling or
that product not meeting a labor
[SPEAKER_13]: requirement or for some reason that
product not being able to deliver the
[SPEAKER_13]: intended value that it was so the people
who own these businesses who are putting
[SPEAKER_13]: the investment into good manufacturing
practices are doing so for the management
[SPEAKER_13]: of risk and really when we get marcus's
products some day imported into the united
[SPEAKER_13]: states or perhaps maybe the better
production model would be marcus's
[SPEAKER_13]: business licenses that production process
and mike and his crew come down to various
[SPEAKER_13]: operations that are licensed producers in
the united states to produce that spec
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble hash in marcus's process so
ultimately when that's made in a cgmp
[SPEAKER_13]: process all of the quality control that
went into developing the process for the
[SPEAKER_13]: release of that product to the canadian
market will be duplicated in the united
[SPEAKER_13]: states market in a way again where it's
kind of like it's interesting because mike
[SPEAKER_13]: west was talking about the parallels of
the of hops and in many ways the the
[SPEAKER_13]: alcohol industry is parallel to the to the
cannabis industry in that they're growing
[SPEAKER_13]: a crop you know grapes right crop means
good genetics good agricultural practices
[SPEAKER_13]: no pesticides very good practices in terms
of delivering a safe product meant for
[SPEAKER_13]: human consumption and then the extraction
of that cannabis or the conversion of
[SPEAKER_13]: those grapes into a reproducible product
that can cross state lines that can cross
[SPEAKER_13]: international boundaries so when you buy a
bottle of that wine from california if
[SPEAKER_13]: you're in canada or if you're in the
united states it's the same quality it's
[SPEAKER_13]: the same taste it's basically the same
flavor the consistency that the owners of
[SPEAKER_13]: these businesses really need to understand
that that's going to be the mechanism in
[SPEAKER_13]: place and so all of the quality control
testing all of the shelf life testing and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything that needs to go into making
any quality product for human consumption
[SPEAKER_13]: is going to go into the so-called industry
because that's what's just needed to
[SPEAKER_13]: happen to make sure that the quality of
the product is what what was intended for
[SPEAKER_14]: for it to be you know and as funny as that
none of that pertains to the food that we
[SPEAKER_13]: eat well you'd like to think that it does
though i mean again when we go to the
[SPEAKER_13]: grocery stores and you could look on say
like a package of i don't know can i use
[SPEAKER_13]: the word meat on this show without
offending people of course it says usda
[SPEAKER_13]: right usda is the us department of
agriculture it says that it's either what
[SPEAKER_13]: uh prime usda or grade a i mean there's a
certain grading of beef and then what the
[SPEAKER_13]: consumer knows when he's buying that
product and bringing it home is that yes
[SPEAKER_13]: there was a government agency and that
that government agency made sure that the
[SPEAKER_13]: place that's producing this product that
i'm bringing home to cook and feed to my
[SPEAKER_13]: family is going to be something that's
going to meet a certain level of
[SPEAKER_13]: requirements and that's part of the good
regulation that happens in government i've
[SPEAKER_17]: also been to restaurants with you guys so
i know that you eat a lot of amazing food
[SPEAKER_17]: that you grow but i also know that you've
definitely eat food that you don't grow so
[SPEAKER_17]: it's it's for the majority of people right
like not if like i can't live on a farm
[SPEAKER_17]: and grow all my food for my family with
what i currently do and not everyone can
[SPEAKER_17]: grow all their own cannabis and all their
organic food and it's amazing for the
[SPEAKER_17]: people that can and the more people that
do it like holy smokes it's amazing um but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's not currently feeding the
world's population and the world's people
[SPEAKER_00]: can have access to the very basic sort of
right that we have which is to nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: to mother earth and all of these systems
have taken us further and further away
[SPEAKER_00]: from that basic right just to have a
relationship with a plant to have
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship maybe with a beer that we
brew you know it's just it's it's all in
[SPEAKER_00]: the gamut and and it's like when we when
we speak from one side of it it's like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: okay well we have to bring that up to make
this conversation more holistic so that
[SPEAKER_00]: those other points you know are are
brought up in it because that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: important we understand as far as yeah as
far as our future forward and and where we
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to be and i love it mark that you
kept saying um you know to mitigate risk
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of these standards are in to
mitigate risk and i have to giggle to
[SPEAKER_00]: myself about the idea of really mitigating
risk with psychedelic plants and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and that's going to be a really
fun frontier what that means and then like
[SPEAKER_00]: the human mind to standardize what we see
as risk like is seeing the devil a risk oh
[SPEAKER_00]: okay well that's like back off okay well
you know if you're gonna be seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: devil we gotta have a standard on that one
you know i mean it's no but jesus is fair
[SPEAKER_13]: game right no devil but if you could see
jesus or jesus all of it mohammed it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: very it's all very important to to to what
what is going to be with such adaptogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: conscious raising plants it makes me
giggle well let's try and just let's try
[SPEAKER_04]: and separate this between what would be
considered nutraceuticals herbal
[SPEAKER_04]: supplements and then we'll would be
considered pharmaceuticals because in all
[SPEAKER_04]: likelihood any government that range and
pharmaceuticals generally need really
[SPEAKER_04]: specific dosages it with in a reproducible
for example pill or other the other
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical delivery api um so you're
gonna have different regular might i mean
[SPEAKER_13]: there's just food so some people are
selling mushrooms right now under the
[SPEAKER_13]: guise of their mushrooms they're edible
their food oh by the way they also have
[SPEAKER_13]: all these other properties but and and and
so the manufacturing of the those are
[SPEAKER_13]: happening in clean kitchens that you would
use to manufacture other food products and
[SPEAKER_13]: the packaging that they're going into and
the way that they're i guess assessing
[SPEAKER_13]: some type of um again we were talking
about this mike last week with alec um
[SPEAKER_13]: whether or not the cannabis testing labs
are gonna test for you know like the dose
[SPEAKER_13]: of psilocybin say like on mushrooms and so
will you actually see a label kind of like
[SPEAKER_13]: on your cannabis products where you have
so many milligrams of thca will there be
[SPEAKER_13]: so many milligrams of psilocybin in there
and then we were asking the question and
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe you know this mike what is the
percentage of psilocybin on typical you
[SPEAKER_13]: know blue cat mushrooms i was always
thinking again there was on like the
[SPEAKER_13]: single digit percentage like one to two to
three percent but do you know what this
[SPEAKER_04]: would be a better question for uh paul uh
spam it sure but potency potency ranges in
[SPEAKER_04]: uh psychedelic mushrooms range anywhere
from about less than half of one percent
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way up to currently in the
literature they've described up to about
[SPEAKER_04]: four and a half five percent i've seen
online people describing up to six percent
[SPEAKER_04]: psilocybin or psilocybin content um but
obviously word you know when you look at
[SPEAKER_04]: psilocybin being the controlled substance
you're only looking at one biosynthesized
[SPEAKER_04]: psychedelic compound within the
psychedelic mushrooms you know when when
[SPEAKER_04]: we bring those products to market i hope i
certainly hope they have psilocybin
[SPEAKER_04]: content but also psilocin and biocystin
content and all the other terpenes that we
[SPEAKER_13]: can find in there uh that's honestly what
you you would imagine that in some way
[SPEAKER_13]: shape or form like like i would just think
like one of the more popular ways of
[SPEAKER_13]: taking psilocybin mushrooms that i've
always done is just capsules because i
[SPEAKER_13]: don't like eating them i don't like
tasting them you put it in the capsule so
[SPEAKER_13]: the question is is like in a seven mil a
700 milligram capsule how much psilocybe
[SPEAKER_13]: how much mushroom ground mushroom so you
go in there and what's the concentration
[SPEAKER_04]: right so i believe that the azure essence
that stamens found were tested at about
[SPEAKER_04]: four percent um the the liberty caps
tested at around two percent most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cubensi species tested about one percent
psilocybin by dry weight right so in it in
[SPEAKER_04]: a gram of mushrooms that puts you at about
a hundred milligrams of a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: milligrams per gram so what you would want
to put inside of each capsule is less than
[SPEAKER_04]: a third of a gram dry weight it would be
sub uh sub intoxicating sub psychotic and
[SPEAKER_06]: the olas like in indonesia are even weaker
i mean they're like 0.1 percent or
[SPEAKER_04]: something they're they're quite low
totally totally yeah and you'll have that
[SPEAKER_04]: range many many of the ones that are
commonly found are going to have less than
[SPEAKER_04]: one percent potency um some of the
hybridization has taken them up but is the
[SPEAKER_13]: is there a uh an entourage effect from
everything else that's in the mushroom
[SPEAKER_13]: that makes the the psilocybin that's there
so if it's only four percent psilocybin
[SPEAKER_13]: that means there's 96 percent other you
know carbohydrates polysaccharide what
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe a little bit of protein i don't
think there's too much protein in
[SPEAKER_13]: mushrooms right mushrooms is mostly
polysaccharide in the fruiting body right
[SPEAKER_04]: but they they do produce mono and
diterpenoids so is is there an entourage
[SPEAKER_13]: or ensemble effect in mushrooms i would
imagine yes yeah yeah i was gonna say you
[SPEAKER_05]: know with you know because there's
psilocybin psilocyn yeah we will not be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to quantifiably say that in in this
you know proven manner until it's
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated in such a way that we can start
culturing those different plants in true
[SPEAKER_06]: but at the same time if you take the four
compounds that uh were just mentioned and
[SPEAKER_06]: you take a enough to have a good dose of
just that single compound you'll see each
[SPEAKER_06]: one is slightly different and if you take
all four of them together it's again it
[SPEAKER_14]: has a synergistic effect well albert often
synthesized the psilocybin a long time ago
[SPEAKER_14]: and they they created synthetic you know
psilocin and it's not the same as taking
[SPEAKER_04]: the mushroom so and they've seen potency
change depending on different leaders as
[SPEAKER_14]: well psilocin and and what i'm saying is
also a lot of people you know nowadays
[SPEAKER_14]: when you when you uh blend up mushrooms
and you put in a capsule you often put
[SPEAKER_14]: other you know herbs and other you know
supportive herbs in the capsule that
[SPEAKER_14]: that's what makes that capsule good for
you so when you know you'll see some
[SPEAKER_14]: hopefully dragonfly will be able to teach
the world about that soon yeah well and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other people you know just put it
out there but compounding is is super
[SPEAKER_00]: important so just in the way supportive
just in the way that we get entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effects with all of these different types
of um you know mind altering or different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of medicinal plants we can compound
them with other plants to get even a
[SPEAKER_00]: further entourage and this is just
herbology this has been happening for a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time and we want to be able to
be as supportive as you can you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be so allopathic that you
know this this particular compound in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom creates this type of cerebral
effect when in fact it might be causing a
[SPEAKER_00]: liver effect that is not so beneficial so
so in compounding these we can really look
[SPEAKER_00]: at ancient histories and ancient different
cultures that have always compounded these
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptogenic psychedelic plant medicines um
and and it's really exciting as they come
[SPEAKER_00]: more through the doorways and more where
we can study them then i really hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: that stage too that we can start this
compounding and having an understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage of the whole plant medicine
world and how they all work together in a
[SPEAKER_00]: poly culture and a myriad of medicines
yeah yeah because many of the mushroom
[SPEAKER_04]: species actually often require some of the
real specific either hardwoods or
[SPEAKER_04]: softwoods because they'll actually be
pulling some of the precursor compounds
[SPEAKER_04]: out of that wood material that then get
brought up and to then get synthesized
[SPEAKER_04]: into the larger molecular weight
triterpenoids that were found in some of
[SPEAKER_14]: those exactly they're a low a low level
toxin to your body that's part of the trip
[SPEAKER_14]: so to be able to take supportive herbs
chinese herbs and different herbs to
[SPEAKER_14]: support your body while you're doing it
then you're not getting the depletion
[SPEAKER_14]: afterwards you're getting the full benefit
and that's often used with mdma as well
[SPEAKER_14]: you know if you're going to do an mdma
therapy you often would take what is it
[SPEAKER_14]: five htp or a few other uh different uh
supportive minerals and herbs with that
[SPEAKER_00]: and my all you do it and mike i love what
you said you know it really is like what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of substrate is the mushroom coming
from it is such yet again i have to say it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an adaptogen not just an adaptogen on
how it makes us feel but what it uptakes
[SPEAKER_00]: in its environment what kind of
epigenetics that it creates into its body
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what type how that those
epigenetics of the medicine translates to
[SPEAKER_00]: our own individual experiences it's so
incredibly vast you know like when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a polypore from a birch mushroom you're
getting betulic acid in it which changes
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole compound of that mushroom
completely then if you were to get it off
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pine tree say and then you've got you
know those a lot of the triterpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: really come from pine just as an example i
just love that you brought that up and it
[SPEAKER_00]: really it makes us realize that there is
no ceiling is basically what i'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: say with these plant medicines in reality
and we know with cannabis is a dynamic
[SPEAKER_14]: accumulator it uptakes toxins well we know
mushrooms uptake it even more like kelly's
[SPEAKER_14]: saying and a lot of times with cubensis
you know you're you're composting manure
[SPEAKER_14]: and new york cuba and manure loving
mushrooms and you would just make sure
[SPEAKER_14]: that that compost and all the manure and
all the hay that you're coming mushroom
[SPEAKER_06]: and or you're breaking up unless my i'm
having trouble here we probably broke up
[SPEAKER_14]: we were just saying it's incredibly
important to have organic compost organic
[SPEAKER_14]: hay and all that in the cultivation of
cubensis because they say it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: play well into being able to culture them
you know culture the culture of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry because being able to
have those locally biodynamic soils are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to allow those farms to be able to
culture those plants you know within their
[SPEAKER_04]: region and you know it leads well to the
evidence than some of the old adage where
[SPEAKER_04]: people would take strawberry clippings or
blueberry clippings or raspberry clippings
[SPEAKER_04]: and put them into their compost and then
feed them those into the compost beds
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking that they can derive some of the
flavor out of those the broken down plant
