[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up everybody welcome to bubble
man's world Johnny B is in the house and
[SPEAKER_03]: welcome to puff Wednesday It's puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, let's puff
something Johnny B's got this incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: little slinger piece that you guys may
have seen me post from Barcelona or you
[SPEAKER_03]: may have seen slinger or Flav or some
other people post Johnny B picked that up
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is a beauty So I'm happy to hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only hit it in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be my first time hitting it in
BC We're gonna do a little rosin squishing
[SPEAKER_03]: today a little well, I mean He's got a
little bit of flour here if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some og chart Very cushy You
know, this is my flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's your and you have that amazing
new press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've got these Pure pressure longs
peak press that I've been using for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last couple of months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hooked up with those guys and I've been
really happy with it Really happy with it
[SPEAKER_03]: serious engineering on this press for
those of you wondering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it better than this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it better than that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very specifically Perfect for
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something that you're gonna
squish, you know a quarter ounce here and
[SPEAKER_03]: a quarter ounce there But taking an ounce
of weed and just squishing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're gonna have squished that in one
shot Absolutely one shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do the Ounce of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got they sent me wonderful tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got big scraper tools here specific
bags Fit inside their plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got these molds here that you can
do pre pressing with Fits real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, it's got a magnetic
bottom that pops up This is not not to
[SPEAKER_03]: make rosin obviously this is to pre press
your bag Sometimes they're big and fluffy
[SPEAKER_03]: and they sit better if you can just give
it a nice little pre press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got the tube What two by nine and
the two point five by nine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre press which we'll do on camera in a
little bit We've got the bags that they
[SPEAKER_03]: send and the cool little tool here first I
was like what the hell is this but very
[SPEAKER_03]: simply put you get your bag on there You
push that through it flips the bag inside
[SPEAKER_03]: out and it puts the seam on the inside of
the bag So it's not gonna carry and hold
[SPEAKER_03]: the oil when you press it out of the
machine This is very simple, but a very
[SPEAKER_03]: very cool little addition I also use it
for if you want to pass me that funnel
[SPEAKER_03]: when I get the funnel going You can keep
that one when I get the funnel going and
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see this on camera in a little bit
as well I kind of I load like this I scoop
[SPEAKER_03]: up the bud and then I use this To just
push the bud through to fall into the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom of the bag and we'll do that ounce
in like Seconds so not like with me when I
[SPEAKER_01]: just grab a bud tighten it up and squish
it very different very different and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I'm just so kind of like Check
this out because a for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like pressing every day, but yeah
Sometimes pressing every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like cleaning that banger I
think you like 15 minutes gotta get it
[SPEAKER_01]: going on prep everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pressed a pound of flour yesterday I
thought 94.8 gram return of rosin and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know guys that are blown with butane they
get like 99 104 96 so what we're saying is
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, you don't unless you really
want to and then that's your prerogative,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what it works, but I'm here to do
You don't get as much when you press Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do with the proper equipment exactly
and that's the problem is all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been kind of but putting things
together not actually having this proper
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment and It looks like we're starting
to see that happen now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite excited for that He's got the
timer going which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is like this dual wall banger so
it's a banger kind of like inside of a
[SPEAKER_01]: banger and a banger banger and a banger
and at first I was kind of like kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's you on it and how it was working
and stuff, but I'm happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not chas like everything else You do
have a few chas bangers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although today you were telling me your
chas banger is kind of like a relief for
[SPEAKER_03]: you to use I don't think this much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you don't have to worry about
chasing it We do have the chas busters
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the chas busters, which are just
another new Branded q-tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're just you know, I guess the
specialness is that they are organic
[SPEAKER_03]: cotton tips Yeah, they're organic The chas
busters are spun to the highest possible
[SPEAKER_03]: specification mounted on a paper stick the
natural flexibility of these gives gentle
[SPEAKER_03]: and precise control organic cotton gots
ICA Italy certified lint free dual tip
[SPEAKER_03]: design optic white and bleach free 100%
plastic free and biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a good Idea and then he's
even got tip for the best results use chas
[SPEAKER_03]: busters with dark crystal glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh got some right here So we're sorted for
the chas de chas in not that I think we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to you can hit that now Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got you over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah, we're giving Johnny like a nice
temp rep here's your carb cap Little niche
[SPEAKER_03]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's the Acapulco gold from lost
gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go give him a father on Instagram
lost gardens It's not lost it's lost Not
[SPEAKER_03]: to ruin your joke I was having still
extremely hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me clean that up for you Yeah,
it's really cool to see everybody at 420
[SPEAKER_01]: you know to Check out a lot of the
different glass that was there was really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool all the different booze that was
happening So yeah, that's the last time I
[SPEAKER_01]: ran into you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was We had a little rip on the puffco
That was pretty cool Yeah, you know it is
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a ton of people like oh blah blah
blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheap Chinese crap It's like I don't
feel that it's cheap at all I use an
[SPEAKER_03]: iPhone which is from China, and it's
probably one of the most technologically
[SPEAKER_03]: advanced tools I have I get camera lenses
that are that are made there I get all
[SPEAKER_03]: sorts of things t-shirts and clothes and I
just see people hypocritically Claiming
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can only support one group of
artists from one specific country Whereas
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like man whatever if you know some
people can't afford $4,000 mothership and
[SPEAKER_03]: for them buying a cheap Glass pipe from
something that's gonna break it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't afford anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know at the same time I like to
support glass artists I love to support
[SPEAKER_03]: guys like slinger and other artists that
I've super stone appreciate your ears
[SPEAKER_01]: learn about a few different things and
talk to Aaron and be able to purchase of
[SPEAKER_01]: what I would say is like a piece of
history mmm, so I look at it because Like
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave would say I got gas glass addicted
syndrome right Dave definitely does have
[SPEAKER_01]: that and he does Just seeing the the
difference in each individual and just
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the work that they do you really
you start really appreciating the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual Old-school and you really see
the art and learning about it I mean I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just fascinated by all of this great
little products like all the different
[SPEAKER_03]: The conversation that began the whole like
wouldn't be cool if there were machines
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could do this with So we are
going to press some rosin today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna press an ounce of Johnny's
buds We might even press an ounce of my
[SPEAKER_03]: buds afterwards just to do a couple of
presses The stuff I have is a solid 20%
[SPEAKER_03]: yielder.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how this compares in regards to
that and we'll take you through the flow
[SPEAKER_03]: of the pure pressure we'll take you
through the recipe and how you Set up the
[SPEAKER_03]: machine Doing the pre pressing filling the
screens and it's really all pretty quick
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do generally is a quick one single
press a couple minutes once I've done that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a second press of the bag for two
to three minutes And I usually get like
[SPEAKER_03]: another little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like from 20 grams 25 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting four to four point five
grams of my first Run, and then I do a
[SPEAKER_03]: second run and get almost a gram like five
point four grams out of Out of one press
[SPEAKER_01]: so by the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be I'm shooting for 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 30 grams here I'm hoping for a
seven point one grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be pretty cool Wouldn't be
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be it'd be good to you,
but but it I was just kind of shooting for
[SPEAKER_03]: it so 20 second heat up Minute and five
second cool down that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I like a bullet is it's
definitely a shredder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just want to hit that again Yes,
I figured you would let me clean it up for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you I've learned is it just how
these little badmats on and protecting
[SPEAKER_01]: your but these little key things and
making sure when you do have a nice pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: you make sure you keep it for the rest of
your life Knock on wood I've broken any
[SPEAKER_01]: glass in a long time Oh, yeah,
that's nice You gave the scar some
[SPEAKER_01]: Scottish touch, and I kind of I kind of
like the whole thing behind it mm-hmm And
[SPEAKER_01]: all my pipes are quite bigger from the t-y
pipes and my mothership stuff like that so
[SPEAKER_01]: having a nice little carry around yeah
Gonna hit some bubble hash this time.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Say double it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a ninja dab on the side for
myself Okay, we got you a nice bubble hash
[SPEAKER_03]: of some El jefe and then we just got to
heat it up, and I got to do the timer for
[SPEAKER_03]: you Maybe about 16 17 seconds seeing as I
didn't have the timer going right away I
[SPEAKER_03]: Do like the rotating around They shout out
to Colton's crew for the t-shirt I
[SPEAKER_03]: Purchased recently off of them to help
send Colton to DC says Colton's crew on
[SPEAKER_03]: the back there
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that's that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean yeah Damn right for the next layer
TAC TAC So right on shout out to Wendy and
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole Turner family awesome people
Colton of course is a Crohn's disease
[SPEAKER_03]: sufferer who has become an amazing
incredible voice and advocate for cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: and Crohn's disease and Yeah, put that
shit into writing Remission and he's he's
[SPEAKER_03]: doing really well still great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh a little bubble and Michael he just did
his All his MRIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did three days of testing for all this
cancer that we had there a couple years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago Which sounds crazy to us?
[SPEAKER_01]: But think of how many times that guy went
to the hospital like 26 surgeries moving
[SPEAKER_01]: tumors and cancer out of his body sent
home Told him that you know to basically
[SPEAKER_01]: pass away years ago cancer-free still uses
cannabis every amazing actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: Rips for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to get pressing I'm gonna
go prepare the pure pressure here get
[SPEAKER_03]: everything organized And then we'll
actually sit back down at the table And
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll show you the quickness of preparing
the ounce of bud and getting it into the
[SPEAKER_03]: screen and getting it ready for the press
Jones gonna shit himself when he sees
[SPEAKER_03]: because he's pressing a bud at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Compared to the one that we're
gonna do today Puffin Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, so we're gonna prepare Johnny B's
herb What is the name of this herb again?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is og shark so I was on the island
long story short Rocking the nitro gloves
[SPEAKER_03]: That was scary that's how they do that
shit at the border when they want to like
[SPEAKER_01]: give you the right They're gonna they're
gonna be looking for this never gotten it
[SPEAKER_01]: personally kinds of spots I mean,
that's the nice way to open up a jar
[SPEAKER_03]: actually absolutely Smells great pop it
down So we're gonna actually we should do
[SPEAKER_03]: is we should wait we should tear it yeah,
so we got to go back in the jar my bad
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't tear this without the bud being out
This is called teamwork this teamwork This
[SPEAKER_03]: puff Wednesday teamwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our hands in the nuggets here We
haven't done this in a while put our hands
[SPEAKER_03]: and we I know what we've been well,
we have just not together It's the Johnny
[SPEAKER_03]: B bubble man bromance here on puff
Wednesday So let's tear that out There you
[SPEAKER_03]: go now you can do what you just did and
maybe we edit it and it looks like we just
[SPEAKER_03]: did it the first Time maybe not though
probably we're not really Deceiving like
[SPEAKER_03]: that So we got 30 grams 30 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for 7.1 in return All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think it's a bad idea to
just get this stock out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just that one big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Can push them all through they all have
resin on it and you know, it's all gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be in reality Yeah, I guess the stock does
have resin on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely I can just see certain the way
I prepared and you kind of this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: like I pulled this out of a Bag of weed
like add a quarter pound of this weed
[SPEAKER_01]: actually like kind of grams And I weighed
out 30 grams Because I'm dying to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in what One squish is all it'll
take Johnny So I got these two tools right
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my workflow right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be good So I get it in the
funnel there just a matter of poking it
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to be like I want to press that
Overzealous there generally Show them
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on see see this And then I'm
gonna do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, why don't you feed the bug?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got Like this is we're gonna
pack the bag a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get it Good and stuffed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right So I'm not a big Presser I
always just squished the button.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've never I don't really use the
bags I really not have really any I have
[SPEAKER_03]: to say this is much easier in the sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: My workflow really is like this Okay,
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to do or three.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was good But then as we both
drop the buds now, I thought you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm eating we gotta get this shit done But
like I was saying I don't really use a bag
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's only because I'm only bling be
pressing a couple ground me using a rev
[SPEAKER_01]: long for Five years four years couple
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me that one who knows Are you using
it on your hair as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll be straightening this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be definitely the haircut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you know, what kinds of weird
things I was going for that Justin Bieber
[SPEAKER_01]: look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, but no, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, throw that last little bit in
there With me for so I these bags like
[SPEAKER_01]: fitting outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Like 30 to 35 grams, I think so
perfect guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring in a 30 G's 30 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was glad that you did I said 30
G's different just like to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that's what it's worth because it's
it's well, it is 30 G's 30 grams These
[SPEAKER_03]: sound cheese as in you know, they both
work Definitely got this bag stuff to the
[SPEAKER_03]: max.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've never had the pleasures of
squishing anything really more than I just
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like squishing and we've used a 73
micron bag 73 micron is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this one's a 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we're gonna go into our Pressure
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is basically what this does.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just drop that in there Yeah,
it's right in there And then I generally
[SPEAKER_03]: just give it one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nice and pre-pressed I like and
now I would always fold these ends over
[SPEAKER_01]: you just Well, you can fold it over all
you want, but it's just gonna pop back
[SPEAKER_03]: over So when we fold it over is when we
put it in the press, we'll bring the
[SPEAKER_03]: plates down We'll slide this in always
leave it up top.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have something to grab the bag Out
of it's a little bit more difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you don't want to have it
upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a tip that I got from The
Sasquatch guys nice so they do that all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time and I like to keep it out So it's
not like, you know when it goes down,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want that piece of screen over So
I'll kind of push it in and make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really on top of the bag and not at
the edge Anything that's at the edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna absorb rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I think we should go press this
Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are here in the bubble man's office aka
hash church central So we we've got the
[SPEAKER_03]: long press turned on We're going to I'm
gonna take John through this really quick
[SPEAKER_03]: I've turned the plates on here if a lot of
people are gonna say that's too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I press it 220 I want that 230.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be fine We'll check we'll give
it a good check out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have proper moisture content in our
buds And I think some people are dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with some very Dried out herb in which
case this is way too hot of a temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna go to recipes and We're
gonna go to the choco lope Kush,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what I was doing recently We're
gonna change the weight because it's 30
[SPEAKER_03]: grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have that in there We've got the
fact that it's flour material Keith hash
[SPEAKER_03]: not available back to flour We've got the
bag size set at 2.5 times 9.
[SPEAKER_03]: The micron set is actually 72 microns on
this one slow temp with a 50% humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably even higher, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: 64 63 63% Okay 62% 62% humidity our
heaters are both on we've got three stages
[SPEAKER_03]: right now a minute a minute in a minute
But we'll see how the flow is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, if the flow is over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just stop it at stage two so we can
go Save and run now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ready to press as you see up here and
generally That's set up So I'm gonna show
[SPEAKER_03]: you a little bit of my workflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my pure pressure rosin bags here
So here we go right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the bag and this bag goes in very
nicely right into here I take the top and
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it into a magnet nice and I put the
bottom right here into the little clip and
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we will do here Actually get up to
this part We'll show you that Here's our
[SPEAKER_03]: toggle switch over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to give us our pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are sitting at a hundred and forty So
we should be good for maximum pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna push both of these five four
three two one zero Now it's starting of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact of how everything comes in
together where it's actually showing the
[SPEAKER_01]: micron size to the amount of weight To
that's um, I'm impressed right now So now
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm releasing the pressure it's not her
hash so you can actually pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: release the majority of the pressure
instantaneously
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see it coming out right
away within 30 seconds is generally when
[SPEAKER_03]: you see it I'll get this lifted up because
I think we're gonna have some nice flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited Yeah, nice to squish
[SPEAKER_03]: It's falling We're getting a fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're getting nice flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this looks like a solid 15 to 20
percent yield Although there's a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more flour than I've been squishing
We'll make sure that it's not gonna go off
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you be in charge of that actually
Should be fine lift it up a tiny bit and
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll the flow will Will thicken up and
cease Very nice thick spots So it's even
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna self on the timer there and
everything so just yeah, it's done in a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute so far in 45 seconds
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to leave it you got to leave it up
you have to do this So if you do that,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no way it can flow out But that's
a good problem to have sometimes I'll pull
[SPEAKER_03]: way more of the paper out as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of There's a couple of ways that I
do it sometimes so well, this is super
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting because a for one Squish for the
next four or five days exactly So yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we could probably stop that soon
the flow looks pretty good So be for two
[SPEAKER_01]: is I got a good buddy that owns one of
these that's a thumbs up It's dripping in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a real good producer, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said this is a killer producer That's
why I wanted to bring it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna stop the press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, I think it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we could leave it Let it finish
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm telling you dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a backdrop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah many backdrops Whoa many many
backdrops.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you'll get lots of chances to take
I'm just thinking this cool It's hard
[SPEAKER_03]: enough perfect so we'll stop the press
That open
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold the top of the bag for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get this out There we go,
