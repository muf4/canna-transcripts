[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, welcome everybody to Hash Church 3.0
episode 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at 20 episodes now, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have been letting people into the
room before we started, as you may notice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just gonna go in and turn the mute
button down on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've got to share the link to our
other chat, which is right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just give me a few seconds to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all right, excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Colin coming in as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_06]: My regulars, Wade and Etienne and Johnny,
fucking B, pardon my French.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Mr. Colin Palmer's in the
house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want you guys to meet a new friend
of mine, Kauru, who's with us today from
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he is a Japanese activist who's been
doing the good fight, kind of the very
[SPEAKER_06]: same thing that we've been doing for all
of these years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess Japan wasn't having it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he ended up having to kind of get his
ass over to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna let him introduce himself and
tell his story.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just wanted to kind of give you guys
a little introduction so you can say hello
[SPEAKER_06]: to our guests today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just love hearing from the youth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love hearing from people from other
countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know that Japan is very,
very strict with cannabis, in particular,
[SPEAKER_06]: the use of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the promotion of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping that Kauru can sort of shed
a little light on what's going on over
[SPEAKER_06]: there in Japan and what really brought him
to Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget, your mic is muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, your mic is muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta unmute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it on right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me today.
Sorry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like, can I just tell the story?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about yourself,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for introducing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Kauru from Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just born and raised in Japan,
like a normal Japanese guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I was in there, I had basic drug
education from elementary school to high
[SPEAKER_03]: school, like once per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the drug education system is pretty
bad there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is mixed up, heroin,
cocaine, weed, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what our government told us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but after I graduated from high
school, I actually went to Hawaii for
[SPEAKER_03]: studying for community college.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took one class.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a social science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one topic from the textbook.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like another difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some things are considered differently
in other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I learned about weed in the class.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So well, I did doing research while mostly
just Googling about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found out it can be used as a
medicinal purpose too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to the street and bought a small
packet of cannabis from a guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was kind of sketchy guy,
but it was actually cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought back to my dormitory and
used it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, that's why I realized I
couldn't realize like the cannabis isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: that bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like us, our government told us what I
found about the lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, after I graduated college,
I went back to Japan and I was just start
[SPEAKER_03]: working as an office job.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to finish my degree thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get a degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I studied abroad again, but next time
was like California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, actually medicinal
purpose was like completely legalized in
[SPEAKER_03]: state of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took medicinal license and I was I
was studying about journalism in the
[SPEAKER_03]: university in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I set up the blog and, you know,
I started tell the story about cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, like tourists of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and after that, after I graduated
from the university, I went back to Japan
[SPEAKER_03]: again and I, you know, started working as
an office worker again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually I got bored and,
you know, I wanted to develop my blog,
[SPEAKER_03]: my blog thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so after that, you know, I wanted to
develop my blog.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and I wanted to know a good way,
like how to grow weed so that people can
[SPEAKER_03]: use it in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because every resources are like in
English, mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually went back to California
again, and there is a school like teaching
[SPEAKER_03]: about how to grow cannabis and local laws
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the school name is like Oak-Seldham
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went there and, you know,
learned a lot about cultivation and I
[SPEAKER_03]: brought back the info.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I spent there for three months
and I went back to Japan again and brought
[SPEAKER_03]: back the info.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the Oak-Seldham and I translated a
lot of info about growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, while I was and after that,
while I was doing my web blog thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: I took the job again, like office worker
as an office worker, like a regular
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got bored again, like pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided to live somewhere else to
keep doing this web blog things because
[SPEAKER_03]: providing information is like really
important part of like legalizing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided I was like looking for the
place and decided to go to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow, I don't know, but I had like a
kind of interest to this country while I
[SPEAKER_03]: was in like in university in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, while I was being here,
like last time I was growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and had like a lot of hands-on
experience and yeah, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: provided that info about how to grow like
from seed to everything, like seed to
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I was being in Mexico last time,
I was looking for a job because I needed
[SPEAKER_03]: to stay a long time, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, eventually I got job, but I had to
go back to Japan again to switch my visa
[SPEAKER_03]: status.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there like two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to switch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went back to Japan and I was waiting
for like paperwork from like ministry,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Mexican embassy in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I was waiting the paperwork,
like police came to my place and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, raided my place and took me to
somewhere in like some rural area in
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually from Tokyo, but you know,
we took like train and like, it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: four or five hours trip and I got
detained, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, police came, police took me to like
detention center in some kind of rural
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I spent there like 40 days over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a basically like same as like
prison in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, less strict though, but I wasn't
free for 40 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after 40 days, I got like,
didn't get charged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like any criminal, any crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually I could come back to Mexico
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, you know, I could, well,
that's why I'm here right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, being an activist still keep
doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where were you when you spent the 40 days?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that in Japan?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was in Japan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they held you for 40 days and told you
we're holding you because of your vlog and
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the information on cannabis
that you're sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of like the info, I provide it,
you know, how to grow and the medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose and like police things,
police thought like I'm pushing to use
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, pushing to making use,
making people use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I got arrested.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they let you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they said to you, did they say,
we don't want to see any more of this from
[SPEAKER_06]: you?
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they, after I got free,
they sent me an email about like shutting
[SPEAKER_03]: down my blog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to explain to us a little bit,
because I know a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_06]: Japanese culture and I know how tightly
wound it can be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got to ask you, like, you know,
on top of the fact, like you're,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're putting a lot aside to promote this
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is it not sort of an extremely
intense energy or feeling to sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: embarrass or get in trouble in the
Japanese culture?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that like getting, you know,
getting in trouble or having something
[SPEAKER_06]: look bad, you know, like, you know,
like embarrassing your family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those are those not things that are
extra sensitive in the Japanese culture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's a very, very well,
it's constant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, pretty bad things to do,
you know, for the passion for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do your parents think about all this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, I mean, you know,
my mother, my mother wanted to stay
[SPEAKER_03]: outside Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of that, you know,
because of that, this boy learned about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and, you know, right now keep
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she is like understandable,
understandable right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: She thinks it's OK, you know, because I
probably bought a lot of info and books
[SPEAKER_03]: written in English or something,
and I translate it for her.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now she understands everything,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, isn't that the power of this intense
plant and the and the intensity of
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding it in each language?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when my friend Paolo approached
me to do an online course for the
[SPEAKER_06]: Brazilian people, you know, I never really
I was like, well, don't they have the
[SPEAKER_06]: Internet?
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they have access to all this
information?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, you know, they they really
don't because all the information is in
[SPEAKER_06]: English and there's not a lot of
information in Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I went and did a lot a class that
is all in Portuguese for extractions and
[SPEAKER_06]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it sounds like we might have to do one
for the Japanese culture as well,
[SPEAKER_06]: because this is very important work that
you're doing, you know, and the fact that
[SPEAKER_06]: you've got governments down on you and
you've got like a whole almost the entire,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, country of Japan, like leaning
towards you saying, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: don't do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to put you in jail for 40 days as
just the first kind of warning is that's
[SPEAKER_06]: incredible to me, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is like that is a long time to put
someone into a jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hasn't even been charged with a crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have anything, you know,
not like gram of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just providing info, but they came.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess in a sense, while you were in
Japan, you sort of owed it to yourself to
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure while you were sharing this
information that you didn't have big bags
[SPEAKER_06]: of weed sitting around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just how illegal is cannabis in Japan
for our audience?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get caught with a gram or you get
caught with, say, half an ounce,
[SPEAKER_06]: what are the repercussions of such a
thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if someone possessed like a
cannabis, even if it's like a gram or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, you will get like at maximum
like five years for like prison time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you sell it, you're going to get
like at maximum like seven years for
[SPEAKER_03]: prison time with like 20,000 US dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's fine for like 20,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you grow it and sell it,
you know, like for commercial reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, it's obviously illegal, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you will get like at maximum like 10
years for prison time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to pay a fine for like 30,000
US dollar equivalent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's in Japanese yen, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how severe we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the walls are.
[SPEAKER_06]: How far do you think we are in Japan
moving things forward?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many how many carros are there in
Japan?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a group of you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there are there more than one of you?
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you communicate with one another to
try and create that web so you can make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure you guys are doing the good work
together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, we have like, you know,
organization group like NPO.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the progress, it's not
going well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet, not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been like the organization has
been doing like for more than decades,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, definitely more than decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, we're in this, you know,
situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what is what is something that the
viewers of Hash Church and the panelists
[SPEAKER_06]: for that matter, because I don't know if
you know this about us, but we're kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: big proponents of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really like to stick our nose in where
it somewhat doesn't belong and kind of get
[SPEAKER_06]: things accelerated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there was a way that Hash Church
panelists, Hash Church audience could
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially accelerate these groups,
how could we do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the names of these groups?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can we find these groups?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we support these groups with
information, with monetary donations?
[SPEAKER_06]: What what are the things we can do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, for the organization,
like, it's called it doesn't have like
[SPEAKER_03]: English name, because it's national thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you just Google it, like a cannabis
organization in Japan, maybe you can find
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called I don't know how I don't know
how many audiences like from here like can
[SPEAKER_03]: understand Japanese, but it's called like
a I don't know how to translate it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's like a medical cannabis
association in Japan or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, like, you know, if you guys like
hit the subscribe button for my channel,
[SPEAKER_03]: that'd be pretty great, because I
sometimes collaborate with the guy from
[SPEAKER_03]: the organizations to.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, can you share your channel with us?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll also be putting it in the
comments section of the YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the high class like this,
the high class.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's on YouTube here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's YouTube here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, my name, Kao Tieshi,
I use like social media with this name,
[SPEAKER_03]: like everything like Twitter, Instagram or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys can Google it and follow
me, that'd be very, very appreciatable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I thought I was muted there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sorry, I'm just going to I'm going
to put it into the comments section of the
[SPEAKER_06]: video and I'll go and make sure I find
your exact channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the high class is what he mentioned
there, guys, in the chat who are watching
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have we do have a couple of folks
watching with us right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure exactly how many,
but there's usually three or four hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got almost three hundred for this early
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam, welcome to the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just talking to Kairu, who's a
Japanese cannabis activist who had to flee
[SPEAKER_06]: Japan so that they wouldn't continue to
lock them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They locked them up for 40 days just for
translating grow information for the
[SPEAKER_06]: people in Japan in Japanese.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's now in Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess still promoting as much as
you can and still getting your vlog up or
[SPEAKER_06]: your blog up on and to the Japanese
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the government is the government there
fighting that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a way for them to shut your sites
down or your information from getting to
[SPEAKER_06]: the people?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to, you know, I used to receiving
the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to receive the email from like
Japanese police.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's no more because I,
you know, I did something for the blog to
[SPEAKER_03]: maintain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot tell about like exactly what I
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, so I think it's safe now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, if I go back to Japan,
they can still like arrest me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would be very wary myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it would be like you
getting home and a week passing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would probably be at the
airport as you were entering the country,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is just the worst after a long
flight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks pretty bad when you're sitting at
home enjoying a Netflix special with your
[SPEAKER_06]: girl and they kick the door down,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But after that, that 13 hour flight to get
to your country, your country,
[SPEAKER_06]: the country that should literally be
potentially building a statue of you at
[SPEAKER_06]: one point in time, because you're sharing
information that is going to help the
[SPEAKER_06]: people of the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time I checked, every single person
in Japan had an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last time I checked, cannabinoids
regulate all biological functions through
[SPEAKER_06]: that system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would seem as though you are doing
the good work as John Belushi and Dan
[SPEAKER_06]: Aykroyd said in the movie Blues Brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are on a mission from God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether you believe in God or not,
I feel that you are definitely on a higher
[SPEAKER_06]: mission.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when your friend who's in the chat
right now mentioned that you had an
[SPEAKER_06]: interest on coming and sharing your story,
I was 100 percent for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that everyone in the audience is
asking, what can we do to help?
[SPEAKER_06]: We love the church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for cannabis and the people that
use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are so far ahead of where you are at
right now that sometimes we forget a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit because we've been in this
fight for so long and we've acquired all
[SPEAKER_06]: of these different freedoms from medical
and recreational and being able to have a
[SPEAKER_06]: licensed and regulated framework that
allows us to engage in this plant that we
[SPEAKER_06]: love so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sometimes forget that there's still
people rotting away in cages and there's
[SPEAKER_06]: still people that are being attacked by
governments and it's something we have to
[SPEAKER_06]: spend a little more time kind of here on
Hash Church in particular, going backwards
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit and helping out some of these
places that aren't California or that
[SPEAKER_06]: aren't Colorado or Canada for that matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to kind of make sure that we
make the international play here positive
[SPEAKER_06]: for all countries involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Japan is a very good one
because it seems to have an incredible
[SPEAKER_06]: culture and incredible people,
but in this one aspect, they just seem to
[SPEAKER_06]: have gotten this really, really wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, for one, thank you, Kairu,
for doing the work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ask again, if there's anything I can
do, perhaps what we need to do is we need
[SPEAKER_06]: to get some of this group that you were
talking about in Japan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think someone translated the name,
something about cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Share the real info with the Japanese
Clinical Association of Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with that
one, but it would be great the same way
[SPEAKER_06]: you have been translating information into
Japanese from our groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be amazing if you could translate
some of what they have into English for
[SPEAKER_06]: our group so that we can understand a way
to maybe engage with these groups a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit more and to help these groups a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just an idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else have any questions for Kairu
or anything they wanted to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming in and talking with
us, Kairu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stunning to hear that that kind of
government interference with a healing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be reminded of how far we've
come in some parts of the world and how
[SPEAKER_00]: far we have to go in other parts of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think or anyone else in the group
think that the recent changes at the UN
[SPEAKER_00]: where they found that cannabis does not
belong in the schedule of controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substances and have recommended that
changes be made in laws across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, the world on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that will make any difference
in Japan?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're asking me, because of
rescheduling the drug schedule,
[SPEAKER_03]: does that affect us, like how do you
think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the UN has an international treaty
that covers all countries are supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be signatories to it, I guess,
that determines how everyone's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis has, as you said,
it used to be that it was linked with
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin and some of the other drugs that
are more problematic, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in the United States, the UN
Convention on Drugs once had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem to have a lot of meaning
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was just wondering if you have any
sense if that might make a difference to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Japanese authorities?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not a lot of people knows that
rescheduling things and actually it seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like it didn't have any impact on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, our government is
thinking of creating new crime for youth
[SPEAKER_03]: age of cannabis, which we didn't used to
have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole world is kind of toward to
legalization, but now we are making it new
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems like it didn't affect in a
good way about the rescheduling things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I answer you correctly?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if I didn't get your question
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you got the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my sense that it's not clear if any
effect will come from this new finding by
[SPEAKER_00]: the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I view it as exciting news in terms of
the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its view on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I realize every country,
every jurisdiction has a different version
[SPEAKER_00]: of and prohibition is still running strong
in many parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, again, thanks for coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for asking me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wade, what you bring up is true because
now every nation has to weigh in on what
[SPEAKER_08]: the UN has done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is a definitely an arrow
in your quill that you can fire there in
[SPEAKER_08]: Japan because medical marijuana is now
internationally recognized.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a I'm a former teacher at Oakster Dam
University, and I consider you one of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dimas Enchi, cannabis warrior.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much for your hard work
and your dedication.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, it comes with great risk and
sacrifice, as you were finding out,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it absolutely frustrates me to hear
Japan continue to push this type of
[SPEAKER_08]: prohibition when there are or were up to
10 growers I'm aware of that grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: in Japan, traditionally hemp for kimonos.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a thing not too long ago and they
showed the women who actually would peel
[SPEAKER_08]: apart the hemp with their teeth and their
teeth are completely worn down from
[SPEAKER_08]: separating the fibers from the lignin
from, you know, individual fibers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is such a traditional crop in the
sense of going back thousands of years and
[SPEAKER_08]: still used for traditional ceremonial
kimonos to this day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how does the Japanese culture weigh the
prohibition when they know there is
[SPEAKER_08]: traditional use or have they been so given
so much misinformation that the
[SPEAKER_08]: traditional Japanese are not aware of
their traditional hemp usage and cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: usage?
[SPEAKER_03]: We are aware about like torsional use of
the hemp and cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we know that, but not a lot of
people, you know, and some of us like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like just forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like once we have it, once we,
you know, live with the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, there's a religion,
it's a particular religion from,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's from Japan, but it's called
Shinto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, we use the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like for a spiritual reason and
like traditional reason, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we forgot about that completely after we
got banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: After the plant got banned from,
by, you know, the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, keep up the good work and the hard
fight because we respect what you're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it started off in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally Canada had a prohibition on any
information.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how Mark Henry got famous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally was the high times case
originally importing high times markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was importing books that weren't
allowed.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just thought that was the most
ridiculous thing ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't have these books.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what, what, what is this like Nazi
Germany?
[SPEAKER_06]: There were burning books now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he honestly couldn't wrap his head
around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was like, it had to have been the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I'm not sure if the book thing
happened after or before, but another
[SPEAKER_06]: thing he did that really like got in the
craw of the Toronto people, the Ontario
[SPEAKER_06]: people were he, they would do these
garbage strikes and then he would go out
[SPEAKER_06]: and hire scabs with his own money and
trucks to go pick up the garbage so that
[SPEAKER_06]: it wasn't just sitting around all nasty
and disgusting, which is what the garbage
[SPEAKER_06]: men want.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can get paid more money,
but he wasn't having it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get paid more money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to put all of our people at
risk by allowing garbage to sit for weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: on end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was another thing that he did.
[SPEAKER_06]: He always liked to do things that society
sort of told him, you know, you're not
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course he's gotten himself into a
bunch of hot water over it over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, he definitely was importing high
times and some other books that at his
[SPEAKER_06]: bookstore in London, Ontario, I believe
where he was, yeah, he was selling these
[SPEAKER_06]: high times and some other books that he,
you know, that Canada had a law against,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was kind of unbelievable that just
one guy sort of pushing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then eventually he would start his own
magazine, you know, like eventually he
[SPEAKER_06]: would, you know, I just think that he was
standing behind high times thinking that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like I'm going to help these
guys and we're going to push this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he kind of slowly realized I
don't think high times is the group to do
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think these are, these aren't the
cannabis warriors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then he started his own cannabis
magazine, cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that magazine went for about
15 plus years and it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pretty good magazine over the
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was a seed catalog with content
over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, that's how we funded the entire
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a 20 page seed catalog,
but funny enough, you know, like photos
[SPEAKER_06]: that high times just scoffed at buying
from me, in particular, my macro
[SPEAKER_06]: photography.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just thought people didn't want to
see that, which is hilarious because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of all, it's what all people want to
see nowadays with macro photography.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Mark was the first magazine out of all
of them to purchase my macro photographs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'd buy them like 20, 30,
40 photos at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas, you know, high times was just
like, no, we don't want those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then eventually, you know,
weed world and red eye and all these other
[SPEAKER_06]: magazines sort of caught up to those types
of photos.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Mark was a little bit ahead of his
time in that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't he get the Sunday shopping opened
up as well, those old blue laws?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he did that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole Christianity, like, oh,
we're at church on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everyone's a Christian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like not everyone goes to church on
Sundays.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like some of us want to go to the mall on
Sundays because we work on Mondays and
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not going to be able to do our
shopping until like, Friday afternoon if
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't go on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, he was he's been a stickler for
a long time, always getting people to
[SPEAKER_06]: react.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Mark's specialty.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also had some incredible varieties that
he offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the Kong specifically,
K-O-N-G.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an offspring of a big bud cross
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember seeing like almost two
litre bottle colas off that variety,
[SPEAKER_02]: like when I was younger growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always stuck my mind that he always
represented this exactly what was the
[SPEAKER_02]: story that you lived, K-O-N-G.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the things that you're exerting remind
me of all the stories that I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcus has lived, Skunkman has lived,
myself, Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are so familiar, the things that you
were touching on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I commend you greatly for following
your passion and going towards it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something a lot of individuals have a
hard time accepting and believing in
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's something I've struggled with
over the years and I finally cracked out
[SPEAKER_02]: of my shell of finally just being like,
you know what, I love this and I've always
[SPEAKER_02]: loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to now talk about it as much
as I can to try to share that love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really commend you in a big way,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the torch and keep it burning bright,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it burning bright.
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of burning bright,
I think it's time for a little banana
[SPEAKER_06]: pudding.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_06]: You down for some banana pudding?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's burn one in honor of this,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were all freedom fighters and we've all
towed our ropes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to understand, K-O-N-G,
30 years ago when I was on the road,
[SPEAKER_08]: they said, kids, stop talking this talk,
go home.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's never going to happen in your
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we feel what you are going
through and greatly respect everything
[SPEAKER_08]: that you're trying to do and why you're
trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're doing is noble.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're doing is respectful.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're doing is honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to know that you have a government
trying to stop you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know and I hope you have found
traditional Japanese have embraced what
[SPEAKER_08]: you are doing and believe in what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how big is the group that you have
there in Japan?
[SPEAKER_08]: How small was it and where is it today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, thanks for,
you know, telling me like a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the organization is like keep
decreasing the members actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, like it was like it's
been doing like more than decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, some of the members like I
used to be patient of like a severe sick,
[SPEAKER_03]: severe, severe illness.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, those people like
eventually have passed away like a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So members are like getting their glist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are like forming, I think,
like new, new groups or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that'd be definitely better for
legalizing stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be great if we could somehow make
them bilingual groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And have them be Japanese and English,
because it would be great if we could
[SPEAKER_06]: somehow get some of our information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And perhaps you're the conduit that we can
do that through.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, perhaps we can feed great
information to you, help back you up on
[SPEAKER_06]: your fight with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, just sort of get the caliber of
information that that no government can
[SPEAKER_06]: deny.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have information that cannot be denied.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's ways of painting these governments
in the corners, particularly with children
[SPEAKER_06]: who require these medicines,
catastrophically ill children in
[SPEAKER_06]: particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's very few governments that want to
stand against that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no hard time like, oh,
hippies and long haired dudes with tie-dye
[SPEAKER_06]: shirts.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll stand against those guys all day
long.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it comes to a little girl having
seizures and suddenly not having seizures,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you got to be a heartless,
heartless, you know, demon to not feel
[SPEAKER_06]: empathy in such a situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wade is someone that could help a lot
with stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, myself, everyone on the panel
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't speak alone when I say we
are available to you, Karu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Karu, I also, in the chat, I posted a
group that I work with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a combat veteran.
[SPEAKER_08]: I served in the military.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a bunch of us veterans got together
recently and we published our first white
[SPEAKER_08]: paper called The Green Paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I put a link to it in the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you open it up, it's a piece of
information that you can use.
[SPEAKER_08]: The original part is the 1993 submittal by
patient zero here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is Robert Randall.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is the gentleman who sued the United
States and won the right to actually
[SPEAKER_08]: receive cannabis grown by the United
States federal government and it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: fascinating piece of literature that was
submitted to the Clinton administration
[SPEAKER_08]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how far, going back to 1993,
we have not moved forward in the United
[SPEAKER_08]: States.
[SPEAKER_08]: But please take this information because
the back end of it is also what Wade was
[SPEAKER_08]: speaking to.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our veterans, Michael Krowitz and
another group, actually changed the law
[SPEAKER_08]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the back end of it is the submittal
with the World Health Organization and the
[SPEAKER_08]: United Nations information regarding that
recent change on December 2nd,
[SPEAKER_08]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_08]: So take that information and spread it,
translate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's there as an educational tool to help.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a shout out to my Veterans Action
Council brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for providing that info.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just checked the link there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another link that I just put up to chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, very, very nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me practice my Japanese.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Professor Watanabe is a very,
very famous researcher in the area of CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: and how it's metabolized in the liver and
has published very, very important
[SPEAKER_04]: research in this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he is a proponent of
cannabis, but I could tell you that their
[SPEAKER_04]: research group has published very
important papers on how CBD is metabolized
[SPEAKER_04]: in the liver.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe a way to sort of embrace the
medical aspects of cannabis is to get
[SPEAKER_04]: support within the Japanese universities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And perhaps Professor Watanabe is a place
to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent idea, Mark, leading him to any
type of professors that have published
[SPEAKER_06]: papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to back yourself up with as much
stuff that's already being done by
[SPEAKER_06]: respected members of the Japanese
community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you want to back yourselves up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be creating relationships with
those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because science is an international
language.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, there is the Japanese
Bulletin of Pharmaceutical Sciences is a
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very important top notch peer
reviewed journal in this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my area of chemistry and natural
products chemistry, some of the most
[SPEAKER_04]: important work and Nobel Prize winning
chemistry has come out of Japanese
[SPEAKER_04]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've met one Japanese professor,
Professor Noyori, who won a Nobel Prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in this area in cannabinoids,
I think Professor Watanabe had many other
[SPEAKER_04]: students who work for him and they're now
working at other institutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think what you see is that if you
can get with him and try to find out his
[SPEAKER_04]: network of cannabinoid research that's
going on currently in Japan, it might be a
[SPEAKER_04]: way for the Japanese culture to embrace
the medical aspects of what cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other important one in Japan is Dr.
Shoyama, who I've met several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several times at ICRS meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, of course,
he also made one mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought CBD was the precursor for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he figured it out later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also was one of the first ones to
put the synthase for THC into tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and feed the medium with CBD and it
transformed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first one in the world to do
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll make a point on getting a list
of all these different names and papers
[SPEAKER_06]: just in case you don't know some of them,
Kairu.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may know all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what level you're at in your
in your absorbing of knowledge at this
[SPEAKER_06]: point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll put everything we can together
and get it sent off in an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have links and full names and stuff
so you can I think it's an excellent idea
[SPEAKER_06]: to lean into the science aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Professor Watanabe's lab that
published that very controversial finding
[SPEAKER_04]: of CBD converting into THC in synthetic
gastric juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a very controversial article
because it implied that potentially you
[SPEAKER_04]: can orally take CBD and in the gut it
would that where it's acidic, it could
[SPEAKER_04]: turn into THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually identified, I think,
four metabolites from from their work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there was follow up work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ethan Russo actually commented on some
following papers because they didn't they
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't able to see any elevated levels of
THC in the bloodstream of patients that
[SPEAKER_04]: were administered CBD only.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there were some flaws to that
study.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that that's fully fully
understood.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was Professor Watanabe's first
paper in this area that caused a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: research and concern in the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so his paper is highly cited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very, very important paper for
what it what it represents.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people in the chat are asking if they
do cannabis marches in Japan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there ever anything like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have actually cannabis march in
Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it happens like May.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, usually it happens May and it's in
like Tokyo, Shibuya.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not you know, we're in like under
the pandemic right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably it's difficult to travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you guys have like opportunity,
you know, please go there and like join
[SPEAKER_03]: the march.
[SPEAKER_03]: That march like welcomes you like anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So would it be good advice when you're
visiting Japan at the cannabis march to
[SPEAKER_06]: probably not have any cannabis on you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I definitely not recommend you
having something, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'll be eating gummies before I go
out for that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can definitely smell,
you know, smell the plant somewhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: but definitely not have it with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole prohibition of this plant like
this plant is loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it's the equivalent of it just
going, hey, hey, I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're just trying not to like heat
yourself out back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, apparently that day is today in
Japan.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for us, it was 20 plus years ago,
you know, like on fish tour down in the U
[SPEAKER_06]: .S.
[SPEAKER_06]: where they were like having binoculars on
the buildings next to the parking lots
[SPEAKER_06]: looking down at people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have these guys in the crowd that
kind of look like hippies, but they're
[SPEAKER_06]: actually narcotics officers and they're
trying to bust people in a project.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all just like potentiating our
stereotypes and burning weed and big bags
[SPEAKER_06]: of weed and eating psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh, my goodness, what were we
thinking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that that's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask you this as I was
listening to you speak before is that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and Marcus will agree with me
that part of the cannabis culture has
[SPEAKER_04]: evolved around music and certain music
genres.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that I'm connected
with is the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and that kind of morphed into fish,
which is kind of like where Marcus and I
[SPEAKER_04]: have common musical roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny because in Japan,
there are Grateful Dead cover bands and
[SPEAKER_04]: there are fish cover bands in Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if there's like a little
micro cannabis culture around those bands
[SPEAKER_04]: that play the music.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we listen to and associate cannabis
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's John Fishman.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from like 93 or 94 Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there any scene around those those
cover bands that bring cannabis around?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's like a very famous hip hop
unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, group in Japan, you know,
they look pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look pretty like a gangster type,
like Japanese gangster type.
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, actually those guys like
promoting like cannabis in a good way in a
[SPEAKER_03]: young among like younger generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, we we still have hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, so regarding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for like starting new topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But regarding the science is like a
universal language, like that's what Marx
[SPEAKER_03]: says, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know like there's a science,
but like too much propaganda from the
[SPEAKER_03]: government, you know, that brainwashes us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to know like how we can stop
that, because our government keep telling
[SPEAKER_03]: like once you do it, once you smoke
cannabis, you will be fucked up like whole
[SPEAKER_03]: life and you will have like, you know,
tendency to kill someone and you'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: barren.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what, you know, our government is
teaching us.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we think like, how can we stop
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I can, you know, beg you like
for the advice, I'm begging you to teach
[SPEAKER_06]: me that it's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The brainwashing happens the most
effectively when there's no alternative
[SPEAKER_06]: information flow, when it's just the
narrative is being controlled 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really easy to brainwash people,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you feed them, they'll
basically swallow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the minute you start putting other
streams into that, you know, that
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge that's not controlled by them,
which is why they're so strict with you
[SPEAKER_06]: sharing information.
[SPEAKER_06]: They put you in jail for 40 days without
charging you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They flexed on you so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, this is how powerful we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could put you away for 10 years if we
actually charge you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you better stop what you're doing in so
many words.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so it's people fighting that
energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, you know, countries like
Thailand, which had extremely,
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely strict cannabis laws just 10
years ago, it was another country you
[SPEAKER_06]: could serve 10 years in prison for getting
caught with hashish or with cannabis in
[SPEAKER_06]: any amount over, you know, like five or 10
grams or something absurd like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the fact that they're even considering
it in Malaysia, I believe, which had the
[SPEAKER_06]: like death penalty or life in prison,
zero tolerance signs all over the airport,
[SPEAKER_06]: like nobody's business, like we have no
problem hanging you.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are extreme perspectives and views,
and those narratives are controlled by
[SPEAKER_06]: controlling the information.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really what you're doing, you know,
sacrificing and moving away from your
[SPEAKER_06]: friends and family to live in Mexico so
you can continue to translate and share
[SPEAKER_06]: this information at the risk of maybe
never being able to go back to your
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without potentially serving jail time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a real thing, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're doing is serious.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all standing here behind you
saying great job.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is important work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Japanese people deserve this plant
as much as anyone on this planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are crimes against humanity that
these governments are perpetrating,
[SPEAKER_06]: keeping plants like this from people that
are so healing, medicinal and
[SPEAKER_06]: preventative, let alone the pharmaceutical
industry couldn't come up with something
[SPEAKER_06]: like this if they tried a drug that works
for like 80% of your elements and the side
[SPEAKER_06]: effect is euphoria.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know, the other aspect we talked
about the science and the academics and
[SPEAKER_04]: again, you know, Japanese culture and
Japanese science has contributed so much
[SPEAKER_04]: in the landscape and the architecture of
what we know today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's the other thing that Japan has
excelled in, which is business,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and one of the major instrument
manufacturers that sells a whole suite of
[SPEAKER_04]: instrumentation to do cannabinoid
measurement, terpene measurement,
[SPEAKER_04]: heavy metal measurement, and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could basically use it in a
cannabis analytical laboratory,
[SPEAKER_04]: Shimazu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sells it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a big Japanese company that
sells instrumentation all over the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're one of the instrumentations that
companies that said, we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: embrace this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they renamed their HPLC the cannabis
analyzer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They renamed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so I mean, they're totally
embracing this market.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have brochures up on their website.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know that in some high rise in
Tokyo, they're counting all their money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming in from all the
instrumentation that they're selling into
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think between the science and the
academics and the business side of things,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, they can't play this game that
cannabis is bad anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is really fucking happening
and it takes millions of dollars to do the
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys are making billions of
dollars selling all this HPLC and GC
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are solid points, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're helping build the armor here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, that is armor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time I did something useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This Garcia crown really works,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of that, Karu?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Shimazu thing, like Shimazu
company, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, like this people from this
foreign society in Japan, we know that,
[SPEAKER_03]: we know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like wonder like how, you know,
how we can still promoting the propaganda,
[SPEAKER_03]: like from the, you know, the government do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one more thing, sorry to add this,
but like yesterday, like Bloomberg,
[SPEAKER_03]: like that's a media, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a very big media, like reporter,
like our government, like we have like
[SPEAKER_03]: government pension investment fund or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they actually bought a lot of stocks
from Canada and, you know, like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: related to like cannabis market,
like cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once our government like told us,
like we, like people, citizens cannot buy
[SPEAKER_03]: the stocks about the company because it's
pushing the like illegal market or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, how it works,
but you know, even the government like
[SPEAKER_03]: restricted us buying the stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says on the news, TV, they do it,
you know, and they, I think it seems like
[SPEAKER_03]: they make a lot of money from the fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like buying stocks and selling
stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like, I don't know what's
going on, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a hypocrisy.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the word.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in your education, Kairu, are you
mentioning things like this to the
[SPEAKER_06]: Japanese people?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you showing these hypocrisies that,
oh, there's this monster company that's
[SPEAKER_06]: actually named one of their analyzers,
the cannabis analyzer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sort of promoting and pointing,
oh, there's these guys that have been
[SPEAKER_06]: studying CBD for the last 30 years in our
universities.
[SPEAKER_06]: If, if, if cannabis has no medical use,
then what are these respectable large
[SPEAKER_06]: companies doing engaging in cannabis
business?
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you been doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what was the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so I'm telling the like, are you,
are you telling the Japanese people of
[SPEAKER_06]: these connections of all these studies
that have been done, the Japanese science
[SPEAKER_06]: scientists, the companies that are
building instruments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not only me, but you know,
there's a, another organization,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, that organization, like keep telling
about the medical Fox and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the company, like Japanese company
doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually we have like another like
Japanese company, like doing the light
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, lighting stuff for like
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the organization, the organization,
like the, the other organization,
[SPEAKER_03]: like keep telling about that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, gradually people are like
knowing like, this isn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like not a, not like really bad things to
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like cannabis is like that bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I answer you correctly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no wrong answers here,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a safe place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't feel nervous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got pretty nervous right now,
by the way, brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you are a warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're making, uh, I think you're
making a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're certainly helping me understand
more fully how much more work we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, hang in there and yeah,
thank you Marcus for bringing this man on
[SPEAKER_00]: our show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bless it be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to ask the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are bringing this up in
the chat and I always see cool Japanese
[SPEAKER_06]: people all dreaded out at reggae concerts
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a wonder like how important has
reggae music been to the education of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Japanese people and pointing and showing
the light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you must've been like, these guys
don't seem like murderers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, probably not my generation,
but like a, like a little bit of older
[SPEAKER_03]: generation, like, uh, they like,
uh, reggae music, like the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot about this legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Mari.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people realize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the canvas isn't bad because of
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, music like influences a lot like
among us too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob was the ultimate cannabis activist and
he was kind of like, he was very much
[SPEAKER_06]: like, I think I would compare him to skunk
man Sam in the sense of just completely in
[SPEAKER_06]: your face, completely pro getting high,
no shame, no apology, just like 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is greatness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first person I really ever met
that I saw do that on like an almost like
[SPEAKER_06]: shocking level of, of honesty was skunk
man Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: He, he was the first person I literally
heard be like, I love getting high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was kind of, I know it's just,
you know what, back then though,
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 years ago, you didn't hear people say
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, everyone was using the
medical thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, oh yeah, it's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sam was just like, everyone should
have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, of course you should have it if
you're sick, but of course you should have
[SPEAKER_06]: it if you're healthy too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I have to get sick to wait till I
get cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal has always been everybody
everywhere for any reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to get high too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I really like getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wake up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first thing I do is I was like,
boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke to joint this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I did five dabs before six a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: Morning everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally got my volume back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was running around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great fighting, great what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody out there who's fighting for
cannabis and for this client has got mad
[SPEAKER_05]: respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm there all the way, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, boom, you need anything,
reach out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love talking about it and anything I
can help.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm always here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like everybody in this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long rep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you, Johnny B in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B and I have not got to hang out
much in the last year with this pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we used to hang out a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be like daily.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like daily, like even like multiple
times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he does not hear me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see you later.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does not live close.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's literally like over an hour away from
where I live, like an hour and 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: even.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one day the global pandemic will end
and we'll be able to get back to seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: each other in person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I miss my trips to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss hanging out with skunk man Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss going to Barcelona and seeing
everyone that comes to town for for the
[SPEAKER_06]: spannibus and for the Masters of Rosin and
for the legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just all of those things are just so
much fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss going to the island of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss all my Jamaican friends and
listening to reggae music.
[SPEAKER_06]: And making hash outdoors under the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like worrying about the ice
melting and kind of trying to find a shady
[SPEAKER_06]: area.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a hot country, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, water hash is not the
most intuitive thing, especially if you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to make it in the jungle,
a two hour hike in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't think about this, but have you
ever thought about how hot you can get
[SPEAKER_06]: carrying ice?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me tell you, it's very hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're Wally Duck from Australia
who's used to plus 45 Celsius in the
[SPEAKER_06]: summertime and he just carries the ice on
his head like it's nobody's business.
[SPEAKER_06]: It impressed all my Jamaican friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you while the rest of us got
soft fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was definitely a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are places we should be linking up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you think, Sam?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have some news, actually,
because I just got done doing the Emerald
[SPEAKER_08]: Cup judging and Tim Blake made us aware
there will be a December Harvest Cup for
[SPEAKER_08]: the Emerald Cup in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be getting together and meeting
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope to see some of you there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Needless to say, because that is very
exciting news.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was wondering, you're in Mexico now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, things are working on
changing there in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there anything that you can use from
what Mexico is doing to change its laws to
[SPEAKER_08]: help you with what you're doing in Japan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm thinking getting the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not legal yet to sell or buy or
anything yet until next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I get into this industry and be a
good guy, giving back to the community
[SPEAKER_03]: from what I got, probably I can promote
using cannabis, having passion for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis use or growing or selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I do it, I can still be a normal guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still be a good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm doing in Mexico so that I
can tell this isn't bad to not all,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Japanese people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm thinking right now,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason to go to Mexico is Mexican
food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wah, wah, wah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let no other stay out of jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always like the cheap kilos of Oaxacan
herb, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always making hash wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So being able to buy some nice cheap kilos
of some actually beautifully grown
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, throw them in the bag,
wash them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus, the other day, Wade and I were in
a clubhouse room talking with a dentist
[SPEAKER_04]: who I think lives right on the border in
Mexico, who's having difficulty getting
[SPEAKER_04]: high CBD oil without having to pay through
the nose to get Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was asking Wade for some hints on
how to make a home CBD remedy for
[SPEAKER_04]: epileptic children.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, she'd have to access the cultivars
first and foremost, then it's just a
[SPEAKER_06]: matter of growing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got the advantage of the sun being
so close to the equator.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably not going to have a hard
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I forget what she said, Wade,
if she had access to hemp, but I thought
[SPEAKER_04]: she did and she was looking for how you
would make it at home, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin is the maybe fastest, easiest way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with rosin, you can dilute it out
to a tincture or whatever it is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, true that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her situation is she didn't have access to
large quantities of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, cultivar selection was a bit of
an issue as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pointed her to a few places where she
might be able to find seeds that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for children with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I walked her through some basic
home scale type production.
Techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, at this point, the market
there, she just did not have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: large quantities of material at this
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate hearing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that there's never a shortage of
people growing thousands of acres for the
[SPEAKER_06]: gray market to smuggle and ship and do all
these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just be good if that was taken
care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard, Mark,
but the federal government and state
[SPEAKER_01]: government has reported an 80 percent
reduction in smuggling marijuana from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico to America that got seized.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, homegrown has pretty much
replaced the market except for a small
[SPEAKER_01]: amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they still grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just don't export it to America
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes the other direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like even in Colombia, they export
their weed to other countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're also allowed for individual
plants too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll be able to grow your own,
I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alice was saying in the room the other day
that the only large quantity cannabis that
[SPEAKER_04]: they have access to in Brazil is brick,
brick weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sounds like what used to come
from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it's gone from Mexico down to
Brazil now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the prices of cannabis and hash
in Japan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about like hash price in
Japan, but the glam of weed over there is
[SPEAKER_03]: like 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 bucks for a gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: USD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gram of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't know what you're going to
get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say, guys,
I'm on a way to go test the huge
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a phone call a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been wanting to do this for like a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to head out and have a good
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll catch you a little bit later
when I get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can't go live on the phone,
I will.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a hundred lighter and I get to
go take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will talk to you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 bucks a gram hash must be like,
I don't even know.
150.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be way more than 150, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes like five grams of weed to make a
gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's good weed, if it's bad weed,
it could take 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be a $500 gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine what six star bubble hash would
sell for in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be rich like pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why it's illegal though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's seriously illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you the price of products in
different countries where it's illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of leans towards just how illegal it
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: $50 a gram for weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's do the math on a pound of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who used to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tie weed to Japan, you know, like multiple
kilos of tie weed at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was selling per, you know,
a hundred bucks a tie stick back,
[SPEAKER_01]: back in those days where they were costing
50 cents in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really crazy is they told me
the only trouble in Japan was that all
[SPEAKER_01]: their customers were Japanese most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a tendency when they got
busted to roll on who delivered it to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that business ended pretty quick,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had a big price to pay if it was
problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's $22,700 for a pound of
cannabis sold at $50 a gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had something to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just got surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, that's a lot of money,
a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at least, I mean, I sell like 50 USD,
but you know, it's like a mini mom and you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know what you're going to get,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are paying more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Depending on quality as well as,
you know, accessibility, but it still
[SPEAKER_08]: shows that prohibition doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that cannabis is still there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is still grown there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even quietly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do hydroponic companies sell knowing
that people are growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it just kind of kept quiet
underground?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it used to be in the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to talk tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We couldn't talk cannabis specifically to
the grow shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would talk tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of tomato growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have tomato growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, there's like shops for like
hydroponic things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like generally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like growing things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But well, I think that was like a few
years ago, but grow shop got raided
[SPEAKER_03]: because the shop owner secretly taught how
to grow weed, like how to use the machines
[SPEAKER_03]: and equipment to their customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I think he got charged some kind
of crime because he is pushing someone to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow weed over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just selling equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a very, very risky business
these days in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was cultivating cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure like he was cultivating,
but you know, he just supplied equipment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, like, you know how you can
grow tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_06]: What he was growing was cultivators.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was creating cultivators.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my mentors, Ron Hickey,
who owned a hydroponic store in Winnipeg
[SPEAKER_06]: after he had just done six years in prison
for growing cannabis, where I'm from
[SPEAKER_06]: originally, used to be pretty harsh with
its laws against cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they put my friend in jail for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did a six year and then he did a five
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he did 11 years in a federal prison for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to get Ron on here one time to
tell some of his stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: So blow your minds.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like him and Skunkman Sam could go on
with each other for hours, I'm certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, he had a hydroponic store.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I was very young, I went into his
store and I was like, Hey, like I'm trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to grow some tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's just like tomatoes, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we just talk about what I know
we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he was just like, took me down to
the basement of his hydro shop and just
[SPEAKER_06]: basically like started to educate me on,
you know, herb and how to grow it and how
[SPEAKER_06]: to take care of it and how to love it and
you know, how to cure it and all of these
[SPEAKER_06]: different things that I just really would
probably not be who I am today without all
[SPEAKER_06]: of that mentoring from him in the early
days, taking me around to all these
[SPEAKER_06]: different grows that he had built.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it was very unique times.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to get Ron on Hash Church one
of these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: But look what you've done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look what you've created and look at this
tool that you've created.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Cairo, this is a now new tool that you
and your Japanese activists can now share
[SPEAKER_08]: this information and go to every Apple
store and everything and post this video
[SPEAKER_08]: on those little videos so that people when
they walk by see and go, wait,
[SPEAKER_08]: who's that Japanese person speaking about
cannabis in Japan?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, come on people, we need to
spread this knowledge far and wide and by
[SPEAKER_08]: every gorilla means necessary so that this
man and what they're trying to do there
[SPEAKER_08]: can break through those barriers because
somebody was in chat earlier saying just
[SPEAKER_08]: any type of cannabis talk in Japan is
crazy talk to those in the older
[SPEAKER_08]: generation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are ways or hopefully or what
ways would you suggest to break through
[SPEAKER_08]: the woeful ignorance of the older Japanese
person watching this today, Cairo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well for older Japanese person,
oh my God, I have no idea but definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: they care about like their health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like their health care things and they
like money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, majority of us like people in
Japan, majority is like older people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to like grip their hearts like
definitely for changing the laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely talking about keeps talking
about health care and health stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, you know, it's pretty basic
thing, but that's very important for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I answer?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is there any like, can we flood
the health minister with information?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what can we do to help you
internationally break through?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything that you suggest that we
can do or any outreach specifically or
[SPEAKER_08]: just sharing this information so people
are aware of what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we need definitely someone some
influence from foreign countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like you said, like health
something, well government work,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because we cannot, we don't
think we can change like from inside,
[SPEAKER_03]: like by ourself because of like the
propaganda that's very, very huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and we, I don't know, we want like you
guys, all you guys are from like
[SPEAKER_03]: non-Japanese people pushing, telling like,
banning cannabis is like anti-moral.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like not for people,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just won't tell, like keep telling
that from outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even though if it's like not like
Japanese, like English, like people can
[SPEAKER_03]: understand English too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, sometimes not a lot of people
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just pushing us, please push us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a lot, give us like a lot of
pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are pharmaceutical cannabis products
available in Japan by prescription from a
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we used to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have like a medicine made with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it's called,
but we had that before, but right now I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think anyone used that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it is possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of interesting because one of
the really big Japanese pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, I can't remember the name right
at this moment, invested huge amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: money into GW Pharmaceuticals.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's funny that the straight
pharmaceutical companies in Japan are
[SPEAKER_01]: investing in new and by GW
Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about grown from plants,
not synthetically made in a laboratory or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny how they can play both sides
of the line.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it possible for a Japanese patient who
has tried everything pharmaceutically and
[SPEAKER_08]: it does not work?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a way for them to petition their
government to import cannabis over a
[SPEAKER_08]: natural pathic medicine from another
country like Canada or Israel or the
[SPEAKER_08]: Netherlands per se?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something we're trying here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's since the program that I talked about
earlier with Robert Randall is only down
[SPEAKER_08]: to currently one patient.
[SPEAKER_08]: So soon that will be no more patients here
that receive even medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there a way for a patient to go
through your medical system to petition
[SPEAKER_08]: the Japanese government to then import
that medicine and therefore break that
[SPEAKER_08]: stereotype?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you ask me is there any way,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am not sure if we can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if people petition for it,
I don't think it's gonna happen,
[SPEAKER_03]: but this helps definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: This may help a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have this guy who has a cancer and he
was a stage four.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually using the cannabis for
himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grew it by himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after he got arrested for possessing
some cannabis, he stopped using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He couldn't use it because he was in a
jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, we won the cannabis plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's very difficult even if a
lot of people from outside Japan ask for
[SPEAKER_03]: that, do some petition for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I gave you the answer
correctly.
[SPEAKER_08]: You answered as best as you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I understand one of the things that we
use here in America was what you're
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about is using patient's testimony
as a arrow by basically telling people,
[SPEAKER_08]: look at this person at this age who is
using this cannabis and using their
[SPEAKER_08]: heartstrings, tugging on the heartstrings,
showing them that this person could have
[SPEAKER_08]: gotten used.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the person you are speaking toward,
are they considered a hero in Japan or are
[SPEAKER_08]: they considered an outcast?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they were using medicine and were
arrested for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The person is outcast right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some people in Japan like trying to
like, well, actually there is a film about
[SPEAKER_03]: him, but not a lot of people are
interested in it somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's so sad though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you reference that film so that we
could be educated on it so we could share
[SPEAKER_08]: it so people could also take this and use
it as a tool to educate other Japanese
[SPEAKER_08]: people?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to share the link in the chat
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can share that in the Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any difference around hemp versus
cannabis in Japan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for background noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there any difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, actually we, I mean, there's a
licensed farmer for hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually we have it, but it's really
difficult to get the license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think like a lot of people can
get it these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference between hemp and
cannabis, we still use the hemp for like
[SPEAKER_03]: making something like clothes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still consume like hemp seeds for
like health care item.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I mean, lately,
lately, like CBDs are like getting popular
[SPEAKER_03]: in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's kind of getting better
about the situation, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: still, still, still people do not,
not a lot of people do not know like hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: and the cannabis is like that same plant,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is the definition still cannabis
variety was less than 0.3% weight THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, so think of it, think of it like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow an acre of that hemp at 0.3%
and let's just use a round number because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's easy to understand the division.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say we get a thousand pounds of dried
plant material from that acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's three pounds of THC per acre,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's a lot of THC to be
growing in a country that can,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get in a whole lot of trouble for,
for THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens to that THC in that hemp
that's grown in Japan?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be going somewhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_08]: They throw the flowers immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they get 500 bucks a gram?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they extract it, there's THC
co-mingling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not extracting it, they're using
it for hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about the hemp flowers in
Japan.
[SPEAKER_08]: They, they burn the flowers and then they
use the fiber for traditional kimonos and
[SPEAKER_08]: other Shinto spiritual uses.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're, as far as I'm aware,
cause this is from an article a few years
[SPEAKER_08]: back that I had read specifically on these
handful of women who are, they're
[SPEAKER_08]: traditionally traditional craftspeople,
which as we know, craftspeople in Japan
[SPEAKER_08]: are, have their own elevated status.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're, as stated, there's only one
particular grow and it's a traditional way
[SPEAKER_08]: that they harvest and it follows their
tradition.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was aware that they just cut the
tops and burn it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand what you're talking about
specifically, you know, scientifically.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just referencing specifically that
regionals growth because even the game,
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghost of Tsushima, which I play on
PlayStation, four and certain areas where
[SPEAKER_08]: you go on the Island, there's traditional
hemp growing in the game because it was
[SPEAKER_08]: traditional to Japan.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It continues to be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, as Keiro was saying,
there's so much misinformation now that
[SPEAKER_08]: the traditional Japanese doesn't know that
they're even the same plant, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look in the chat, you'll see an
article I posted about traditional hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this was a half an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also posted one about an interview
with Dr. Shoyama who was a pioneer in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis chemistry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting that a country that was so
against cannabis would have so many
[SPEAKER_06]: chemistry pioneers in chem, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a thousand, thousands of year history
of using cannabis just in different
[SPEAKER_08]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fascism sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: But thankfully we have warriors like Keiro
out there who are actually working toward
[SPEAKER_08]: changing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need more more like you doing what
you're doing so that we can break down the
[SPEAKER_08]: barriers so that, you know, many years
from now, people won't know what you had
[SPEAKER_08]: to deal with because it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a shame that you are shamed out of
your own country for doing what is
[SPEAKER_08]: historically part of its tradition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you know Japanese citizens that sit
in jail today because they used cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're in there for a long time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot, a lot, a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people still like got caught
because of like possess or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That went a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see like a news article like every day,
like someone got caught, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: any friends of yours, a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I have, you know,
I have no one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably my friends are like, okay,
somehow, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again, when you consider the
business aspects, if people are getting in
[SPEAKER_04]: trouble and people are getting busted,
there's a bunch of people making money off
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people who make money off that are
the testing companies because now people
[SPEAKER_04]: have to piss into a bottle and all the
attorneys and the courts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't exactly know how prison is
handled in Japan, but certainly here in
[SPEAKER_04]: the United States, there's lots of
industries that benefit from cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibition and they need cannabis to be
illegal in order for their businesses to
[SPEAKER_04]: thrive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't want the laws to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which again, is quite hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a possibility, one of the things
that we found is a powerful tool,
[SPEAKER_08]: which you may have seen at Oakster Dam
University is Chris Conrad and Mickey
[SPEAKER_08]: Norris created a prisoners educational
campaign where they would actually compile
[SPEAKER_08]: the names and pictures and the stories of
those who have been arrested here in the
[SPEAKER_08]: United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they made it into a wall that
would travel around.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they would just take a little travel
wall and where they would go, they would
[SPEAKER_08]: put the faces so that people could see the
faces of these people and know their names
[SPEAKER_08]: and know their stories and know why
they're in jail and for how long they're
[SPEAKER_08]: in jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found that was a great educational tool
to make people aware of the injustice
[SPEAKER_08]: because it puts a face to the issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no longer just about the issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are hundreds of faces with stories
that could be your brother, your sister,
[SPEAKER_08]: your cousin, your nephew.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found these were very effective tools.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you might consider start building a
database of those and then also then
[SPEAKER_08]: making a mirror back to Japan and say,
look at your sons and your daughters that
[SPEAKER_08]: you have put in jail over this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is what, and then add up all
their years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see that there's hundreds of
years there that people are serving all
[SPEAKER_08]: over a simple plant that is part of your
tradition.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's shameful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you should use that education
potentially if you want, that is a tool
[SPEAKER_08]: that you could use to shape, to show them
the injustice that traditional Japanese
[SPEAKER_08]: are experiencing today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to tell the story about,
you know, the people got caught about just
[SPEAKER_03]: self producing or growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, one of the things that we even
know about how harsh Japanese laws are
[SPEAKER_08]: today is because a musician, Paul
McCartney got busted many, many years ago
[SPEAKER_08]: with a lot of cannabis and he spent,
and he did time in Japan.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're well aware of the injustices just
from him alone, but he got off light
[SPEAKER_08]: because he was a celebrity.
[SPEAKER_08]: If he was traditional Japanese,
he would still probably be in jail today.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a celebrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why he was okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But normal people like us, like me,
I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I can get out like that
soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not for that much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause when he caught with like a quarter
pound or something or a pound of weed,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was a significant mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Sheldon, do you remember what he got
busted with?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or how much it wasn't like an ounce?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was just his personal stash in a
suitcase.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quite embarrassing how little it
was, which tells you the tolerance level,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just even head stashes against
the law, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he manned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did his time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing was that he didn't ask
one of the stage crew or anybody else to
[SPEAKER_01]: carry it for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was a man about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I remember right though,
part of his plea agreement and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: helped him get out early was he made an
anti-drug promo for the Japanese
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've given him a lot of things to
think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, again, just the hypocrisy
that's to Japan,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I mean, this is, this happens
everywhere, you know, and what,
[SPEAKER_04]: what can they learn?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you said at AT&T is like where we
were like 23, 24 years ago, maybe in some
[SPEAKER_04]: States, you know, certainly California and
Colorado were a little more progressive
[SPEAKER_04]: and other States.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if you just look at the,
the greening of the U S map in the last
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 25 years, you could see that,
you know, the, the, the train has left the
[SPEAKER_04]: station and there's no turning back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were talking about this on
clubhouse the other day with Michael back
[SPEAKER_04]: as he thinks it's very important that the
UN's treaty has now what do you listed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I saying this right?
[SPEAKER_04]: AT&T they've removed cannabis from their
schedule for it was a schedule for which
[SPEAKER_08]: made it had no medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was removed from that on December
2nd, 2020.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now for the first time in the world,
since the forties, et cetera, medical
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana is legal across the world and
countries can use this UN charter to show
[SPEAKER_08]: that it is now legal internationally,
medically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that changes the financials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it changes like banking, it changes,
it changes the way the world works
[SPEAKER_04]: according to when it deals with cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is that real?
[SPEAKER_04]: And will we end up seeing that at the
consumer level?
[SPEAKER_08]: In time, but I mean, we haven't even seen
the DEA is still in denial and has not
[SPEAKER_08]: even put out a statement regarding it
because the rest of the world looks to the
[SPEAKER_08]: DEA is kind of the ruling party because
they're the ones that usually have the
[SPEAKER_08]: outside influence that comes into
countries with, you know, military,
[SPEAKER_08]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: So their silence has been absolutely
deafening.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are moments where countries are
seeing like, you know, Mexico and others
[SPEAKER_08]: are being emboldened by this change
internationally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it can actually take this into
Japan and educate them on the laws of
[SPEAKER_08]: change and what you thought you knew is no
longer what we know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And because it is medically accessible,
it is now against international law for
[SPEAKER_08]: Japan to possibly prosecute.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are things that individual countries
now have to exercise and find out at the
[SPEAKER_08]: international level, but we are seeing
other countries as stated being very
[SPEAKER_01]: international.
[SPEAKER_01]: International countries make the final
legal decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can follow the UN suggestion or they
can say, screw you UN and continue to put
[SPEAKER_01]: them in the electric chair if they have a
single seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: There already has been importation of
cannabis from country to country.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's already been happening kind of
around the language of the existing
[SPEAKER_04]: treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the change in the treaty now makes
that compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, it's always been for medical use,
not for recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: International trade.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know how you make the
distinction when it's just bulk material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, like if I stubbed my toe,
that's medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, if you're talking about
importing, whether it's finished goods or,
[SPEAKER_04]: or, or oil or, or, or biomass,
I don't think you would be doing that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think it would be, you know,
finished packaged goods done in a white
[SPEAKER_04]: label, you know, facility in a place where
labor is inexpensive being exported to
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you know, market that has the money,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_04]: Western Europe and the United States
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably decided by both the exporter
and importing country how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've heard of it going in bulk to
Germany, for example, from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and eventually Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think like maybe like 10 years from
now, Japan will, we'll catch up with the
[SPEAKER_04]: rest of the world that, you know,
this is an international commodity similar
[SPEAKER_04]: to, I guess, tobacco in that, you know,
respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grown, it's processed, it's made into
products and people in all countries want
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there shouldn't be laws that would
discriminate against access to those
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting that you say
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again, I don't know how,
how would they, how would they be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: control that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would they be able to control that down to
the retail level?
[SPEAKER_01]: There probably has to be a doctor script.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have to buy it from a
pharmacy or a supplier of a pharmacy or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's professional like every other
pharmaceutical drug you buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what we have in Pennsylvania
is totally medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we have is cards and it's
good at dispensary, yada, yada,
[SPEAKER_04]: yada.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, what, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, yeah, I, I, I just wouldn't know how
they would keep it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If some States are like recreational and
medical, how would they segregate it?
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd have to, it would have to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know here in Holland, if you have a
doctor's prescription, you can buy better
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of weed from various upper techs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to travel to other
countries in Europe with your medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's legal under the shabani agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you contact the opposite medicinal
cannabis and they write a letter
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining what's going on and you can do
it legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Mark, in, in Massachusetts,
the CCC requires a certain threshold for
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational and medical to be held at all
times behind and back a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you come in, there's a different
register system that is accounted for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for recreational as there is for medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see different sales associates for
those specific lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a different menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be things on the medical menu
that may not be available on the
[SPEAKER_02]: recreation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a different dosage requirement
as well in the state of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have above five milligrams per
dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a gummy, let's say it can't
be above five milligrams per, per that
[SPEAKER_02]: dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can put, you know, 25 recreational
side, Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the rec on the rec side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on the medical side, it could be,
I think it goes up to a hundred or 20 or a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, like a hundred
milligrams or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, you could get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but what's interesting about that is
that when you move over to tinctures,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as much as I could fit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what a bunch of meaningless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, kind of, it just, it falls the black
quick in terms of the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're like, wait, I, I'm restricted
really heavily here, but over here,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's free range, you know,
like, you know, you can, you can really
[SPEAKER_02]: formulate for instance, you know,
for the medical side in a, in a particular
[SPEAKER_02]: way that is a lot more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, you know, it encourages
people to actually have a medical card.
[SPEAKER_02]: You save money like in any state over the
taxes, you know, there there's benefits,
but.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you save money by going to the gas
station and getting yourself some Delta
[SPEAKER_04]: eight gummies and Delta, Delta eight
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and then you're all set.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's what you think cannabis is
in the cannabis unfriendly environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's a different,
that's a totally different one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but I think that's how we deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've dealt with it in this
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's to your point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's, there's in non-cannabis
friendly states, you know, you have your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your Delta eights and you have your gas
station buys and that's shaping their
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and their understanding of
where, where.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis is for them,
but you know, we, we have thresholds and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would imagine when PA does its thing to go
rack, it's going to be similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that, that's what I've seen
under, how does California deal with it
[SPEAKER_02]: currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Etienne, do you guys have these
thresholds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys dealing with any of that kind
of stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just simply, this is rack and
this is medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it, you know, is it even.
[SPEAKER_02]: A thing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end would be a better one to
answer that question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the question?
[SPEAKER_08]: What were you drinking?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coconut water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife was asking, I was having a
conversation with my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was asking, you know, in, in the,
in the state that I've been operational
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was thresholds for recreational
and medical that you had to kind of abide
[SPEAKER_02]: by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have in doses, you know,
everything from dosing and then all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way to the amount that you have for
retail, like there has to be a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold to account for patients versus
recreational patients, if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: There has been a distinction IE for
edibles in California, but for the most
[SPEAKER_08]: part for the flower and everything else is
pretty just normalized over the counter.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are availability of thousand
milligram options for medical specifically
[SPEAKER_08]: in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, these are just arbitrary made
up numbers decided by somebody out of
[SPEAKER_08]: fear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing of the 0.03% TSC and hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think AT&T?
[SPEAKER_08]: It should, because what I use is different
than what you use.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my medical use, especially for
somebody who is going through a severe
[SPEAKER_08]: medical situation, it needs to be a higher
dose we have found to be effective.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we found once the laws changed in
2018, there was a whole swath of edible
[SPEAKER_08]: and edible options we lost in California
because they were in the higher level of
[SPEAKER_08]: THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to also understand that all
these products prior were made by patients
[SPEAKER_08]: for patients, because there were not a
product on the market that met their
[SPEAKER_08]: medicinal need.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there were thousand milligram edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were exceedingly large THC amounts
that unfortunately recreational users
[SPEAKER_08]: found out by accident or had adverse
reactions, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: But those medical users still pine and
wish they could have access to those
[SPEAKER_08]: older, higher THC edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we have seen here in the United
States, Kero, is we haven't pushed back by
[SPEAKER_08]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of our oldest politicians,
Dianne Feinstein, here in California is
[SPEAKER_08]: pushing to lower THC limits below a
man-made threshold.
[SPEAKER_08]: She has no understanding of what I use,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: But me and my other veterans all use high
THC edibles, medibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use concentrates, because it helps me
with the various symptoms of my
[SPEAKER_08]: post-traumatic stress disorder and my
self-war syndrome.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for me, it is very helpful and useful,
whereas if a normal person who had never
[SPEAKER_08]: experienced THC ingested what I ingest on
a day's time, it would be beyond
[SPEAKER_08]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there has to be a balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what Colin is speaking to is there is
not a balance here domestically.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in each one of our states,
we're dealing with current prohibitions to
[SPEAKER_08]: lower THC limits.
[SPEAKER_08]: We dealt with it last year in California,
and we were able to get that away.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, right now in Florida and in other
states, they're actively trying to push
[SPEAKER_08]: lower THC thresholds out of fear.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even though we've moved things
exponentially here, Kero, we still have
[SPEAKER_08]: politicians and those that either benefit
or want to benefit from this prohibition
[SPEAKER_08]: continuing to use lies, outright
misinformation, and confusion,
[SPEAKER_08]: and using these kind of a downtime by
being quiet about it in their states,
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to do it quietly so they don't get
the pushback or the yell from the
[SPEAKER_08]: community at large, which of course,
Florida is trying to mobilize.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the politicians change the laws
quicker sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the populace can educate themselves
on the law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, that may sound confusing,
but we just have a great pushback.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to be constantly diligent even
here right now because right now it's
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin Sabet and SMART, who is the largest
anti-prohibitionist organization currently
[SPEAKER_08]: going.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are actively going around pushing
Colorado, Florida, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've created an organization of
prohibitionists, Kero, that are going out
[SPEAKER_08]: to push lies and misinformation to change
the laws currently because we have been so
[SPEAKER_08]: effective in changing the laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they want to make up lines in the sand
to say, oh, well, above 15% THC is now the
[SPEAKER_08]: danger and is now the big, spooky,
evil boogeyman, which is not the case.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, THC can be abused.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, people cannot handle high THC,
but we can't lump everybody into the same
[SPEAKER_08]: use because we, the medical people,
are going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we, the medical people, are going to be
the ones with the loudest, fuck,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know we're not going to take this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to fight it and we have to go back
out to our educators and to our
[SPEAKER_08]: constituency, our politicians,
and make them aware that this is a lie.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is manipulation and you're being
manipulated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the work still needs to be there right
now because the laws are changing this
[SPEAKER_08]: week in Florida and as well as they're
trying to in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: So people, if you're watching and you're
in those states, get active, find a local
[SPEAKER_08]: organization, get a petition, call your
constituency, make them aware to challenge
[SPEAKER_08]: these laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: That they do not deserve to be happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, it's 2021, but shit's still
happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't sit on our asses and do nothing
people, get active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd like to jump in and take it back
over to Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking about ways that you
might be able to create messaging to
[SPEAKER_00]: change public perception so that people
more fully understand what cannabis could
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you observed that the Japanese culture
is heavily,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of folks who are elders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of conditions that
many elders are subject to that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very helpful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arthritis comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly cancer and some of the effects
of cancer treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the same way, I think it was
Etienne who suggested that you put
[SPEAKER_00]: together a wall, if you will, of
photographs of people who are in jail over
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also do the same thing about
educating folks around persons who are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with a condition like arthritis or
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it might be a benefit for their
condition because it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of why I'm so fervent about my
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love for this plant is I've seen over
the years what it can do for so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different people in so many different
situations that have to do with their
[SPEAKER_00]: health and their sense of wellbeing and
their joy of living, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's just a thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personalizing an issue like cannabis
prohibition is what changes people's minds
[SPEAKER_00]: because it opens their heart to understand
the predicament of the folks around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone enjoys full health for
whatever reason, but personalizing things
[SPEAKER_00]: helps people open their minds and that
opens their hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you change people's
perceptions of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also suggest utilizing and
reaching out to your veterans.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are veterans who have served in
international conflicts around the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have found that veterans voices,
because we use cannabis, because we have
[SPEAKER_08]: tried every other pharmaceutical use out
there and we have not found the health
[SPEAKER_08]: that we have found in cannabis,
as well as other psychedelic plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, cannabis is more of a pallative for
the day to day.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also know that mushrooms,
as well as other psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_08]: are very helpful for dealing with the
post-traumatic stress that people have
[SPEAKER_08]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do not neglect the veterans' voices
because they are very strong because Japan
[SPEAKER_08]: loves and respects its warriors,
of which you are one.
[SPEAKER_08]: But those who have served in combat hold
another special eye and they're held on
[SPEAKER_08]: their own pedestal, so to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't forget to actually lean on them
as well because they will speak up because
[SPEAKER_08]: they have used and want to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they love their mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Japanese people love mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, there's history here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys love your records too,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to be the most incredible record
collections ever in the world in Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you must know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're really lucky to have that as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That culture is thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are psychedelics mushrooms, LSD,
as illegal as psilocybin mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they as illegal as cannabis in Japan
or are they more tolerated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's illegal right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's illegal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, more than two decades ago,
it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we didn't have any rules like
consuming mushrooms, but one actor from
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan got panicked after he ate mushroom
and did something crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's banned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave it to one guy to mess it up for
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should name the law after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of law around drugs has to
do with fear of how people might misuse
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meantime, out of fear, we miss all of
the potential benefit and opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: healing and acting sanely about the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, governments want to control people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governments should be in service to the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, it seems to be more about
wanting to control people in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: people think.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a public misconception of this one
guy who had a mystical event, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What a shame.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody said the gentleman actually ate
mushrooms and ran into a store naked
[SPEAKER_08]: asking for his mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was she working there for sale or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was probably the most exciting thing
that happened to all those spectators all
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humans do the craziest shit, especially on
psychedelics.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Art Linkletter always said,
drugs do the darnedest things.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I miss something funny?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are smiling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we were talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody posted in chat that there was a
famous Japanese actor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what happened is he stripped off his
clothes and ran into a store asking for
[SPEAKER_08]: his mother.
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently that was the negative
reaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas most people, if they saw a famous
star naked, they would all be very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mushrooms were legal up to that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this happened to this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now mushrooms are illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then we're talking about the dumb shit
we've done on psychedelics, which I know
[SPEAKER_08]: none of us have ever done anything out of
the ordinary.
[SPEAKER_08]: And any psychedelics in any way,
shape or form, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm old enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, thank God we grew up in a time
that didn't have cell phones and cameras
[SPEAKER_06]: in everyone's pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really happy that the technology
exists and I can engage with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the timing of it came perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not need this shit when I was 16.
[SPEAKER_06]: 17, 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was, I think it was 16,
the last time I had health class in high
[SPEAKER_04]: school and they had like the, the scary
drug video for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when they got, when it got to
the LSD part, they showed a woman at a
[SPEAKER_04]: party and the party had like sixties mod
music playing and like typical acid kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of sixties party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she, she took, and they said on LSD,
you have illusions that things aren't the
[SPEAKER_04]: way they see, you know, and next thing you
know, she's on the balcony wanting to kill
[SPEAKER_04]: herself, wanting to jump off the balcony
and trying to scare people to think,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, if you take this, you're going to find
the balcony at the party and you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to teeter on the edge of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't show her jumping off,
but you know, just to reenact it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a terrible vibe to pre-promote.
[SPEAKER_08]: For us in Louisiana, they showed this
woman the dangers of LSD and they showed
[SPEAKER_08]: us this movie and this woman jumps out of
a second story window and lands on the
[SPEAKER_08]: ground and starts taking the glass and
starts cutting her arms up and the dangers
[SPEAKER_08]: of LSD.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, they've, they've used some
shocking, odd needless to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's the same video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just turned my head away when
that, when that part came.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real bring down when you're at an
acid party and some woman does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Start at the ground floor first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't, don't go out at the second.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were at a, we were at a drive-in movie
theater at an all night showing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They first showed the Pink Floyd movie and
then at midnight showed the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_04]: movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had two back to back movies at a
drive-in movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember drive-in movie theaters.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were so much fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be able to bring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lawn chairs and just the cooler full of
beer and all your friends in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it was just, it was so safe and
nobody could really get hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, you know, it was just, it's like an
environment, like a Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've made a comeback lately due to
COVID.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're popping up all over the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to talk about that for a second,
because I'm seeing more and more
[SPEAKER_04]: announcements of festivals happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess, you know, maybe herd immunity
and the vaccination rate of the general
[SPEAKER_04]: population is just getting to the point
where I guess live music is making its
[SPEAKER_04]: return, which is a wonderful thing because
it's part of our culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I said earlier, there is going to be
a Emil cup this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim announced it during the finishing of
this year's competition or pardon me,
[SPEAKER_08]: 2020s competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will be, we will be in person.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope to see Wade and y'all and others
hopefully, and get some hugs in person
[SPEAKER_08]: because I'm vaccine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I'm judging again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to be wandering around in
the crowd.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys all gotten vaccinated yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone gotten vaccinated here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my first shot a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next one's due April 6th.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got my first and second shot because in
California we got as designated as a
[SPEAKER_08]: emergency personnel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were one eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were part of the initial push.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had my second shot three weeks ago,
so I'm fully immune and I am beyond ready
[SPEAKER_08]: and happy to see people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so wearing my mask, being responsible.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we take a quick poll in the chat
just because we got, well, like 400 people
[SPEAKER_04]: watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys gotten your shots yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't wait to get my shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll be notified when they become
available or so to speak, or we have to go
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere to get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think the faster we get on the
other side of this, hopefully it'll be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish people were willing to try and look
at getting healthier in the way they are
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at getting shots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not against anyone getting a shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally won't be getting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do like the idea of people
increasing the caliber of their immune
[SPEAKER_06]: system and getting healthier and eating
better foods and consuming better
[SPEAKER_06]: beverages and just sort of just taking
better care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's definitely something to be said
for some of what we've learned during
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think another thing is that we realized
when COVID started, when they started
[SPEAKER_06]: telling us we've got to protect our
elderly community because they're more at
[SPEAKER_06]: risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought, well, what about when we
were killing them with influenza for the
[SPEAKER_06]: last several hundred years?
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people died from influenza and
guaranteed they got that shit from their
[SPEAKER_06]: family members or the little girl at
school who gave it to the little boy who
[SPEAKER_06]: came home and gave it to his mom,
who gave it to her mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's a neat idea maybe in
certain months that we are a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more protective.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even imagine that we pick these
months like February and November.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to go and do these huge cannabis
gatherings, smoke a bunch of things
[SPEAKER_06]: together, get the cannabis cup cough,
damn near die.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I called it the plague one year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it in Spain and it was no fucking
joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think those things have been really
good for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And listen, for those who are really
excited to get the vaccine, I would fight
[SPEAKER_06]: for your right to get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would hope that you would fight for
my right to say, I'll pass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the irony is, of course,
my mom went to get hers and she got the
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnson and Johnson this week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, they tested it the same day
and she is actually positive for COVID.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm in the midst of hoping and
co-positive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So much love to my mom and I hope she's
healing well and I hope she gets through
[SPEAKER_08]: this because she's 79.
[SPEAKER_08]: And her caregiver who was watching her
brought her home to her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, they're in Texas.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I love you, mom.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're feeling better and I hope
you get past this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And anybody else who's dealing with it,
all the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have the availability,
get the vaccine.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't want to, that's your choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm one of those who are proud to have
gotten it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy I have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's your choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I love science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to remember, folks,
that even if you get the vaccine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can still get another vaccine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can still get another variant of
COVID again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably going to prevent you from
getting sick, very sick and dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vaccine is not the silver bullet
that's going to cure all the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as so many people have this,
it will keep mutating and making different
[SPEAKER_01]: variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get the population down to zero,
zero, zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less, less, less.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that is the key.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the key is to also be able to have
sane conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I want to go into big
conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you ask that question,
it turned into the standard internet like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, getting a vaccine equals idiot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the other version was, oh, I thought
there was a lot of intelligent people in
[SPEAKER_06]: here until I saw them say they weren't
going to get the vaccine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy to have a conversation about
vaccines without dropping the vibe down to
[SPEAKER_06]: name calling and sort of high school
arguments.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always think we're right in our
decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the whole reason we make our
decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't be so afraid to have
conversations and maybe discover someone
[SPEAKER_06]: else's perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not enforcing anyone to take or not
take.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is interesting how hard it is for
that concept to survive in this day and
[SPEAKER_06]: age, in this world, the concept of
allowing both to hold space
[SPEAKER_06]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean I have to stand on the edge of
the fence instead of choosing which side
[SPEAKER_06]: the grass is greener?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not greener on either side.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an illusion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put there by the fence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So get on the fence and don't be so
fervent in your belief or at least be more
[SPEAKER_06]: kind when you discuss with someone on the
other side of that fence rather than right
[SPEAKER_06]: to name calling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two seconds after you asked that question,
Mark, it was just I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it's the fault of the
reactors who immediately go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is a very natural human thing to go
to that level.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to basic human tolerance?
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to tolerate each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: I accepted you for who you are,
the freak that you are, the freak that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're not, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for some reason, tolerance has been
lost in accepting of other people's
[SPEAKER_08]: opinions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?
[SPEAKER_08]: If people disagree with you, everybody has
the right because they've had their
[SPEAKER_08]: experiences and it is not my right to tell
anybody anything except I will fight for
[SPEAKER_08]: your right to say whatever the fuck you
want, you know, freedom of speech.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say scientifically,
I put vaccinations in one of the buckets
[SPEAKER_04]: of huge advancements that medical science
has made over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I've vaccinated all my
kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to think that the covid vaccine
would be just another of the regimen of
[SPEAKER_04]: vaccines that, you know, you normally get,
you know, like against polio, which,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, we've all but wiped out smallpox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smallpox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I live close to Jenner'sville,
where Dr. Jenner actually developed the
[SPEAKER_04]: smallpox vaccine during a revolutionary
war.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that another thing just
talking about the Internet reaction is
[SPEAKER_04]: like, yeah, it's like part of having a
discussion is opening up your mind to
[SPEAKER_04]: learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as you get like this
partisanship that happens in either a
[SPEAKER_04]: politics discussion or a vaccine
discussion or whatever, there's discussion
[SPEAKER_04]: where there's two sides like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it just takes things into a
completely unproductive area, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you policing the the chat
to let people know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we should try to keep these discussions
civil like it were a clubhouse room that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, everybody has their own opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just sharing, you know,
again, as a parent, as a person,
[SPEAKER_04]: what I've done in my life, that doesn't
mean that's the right thing for everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: else to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, again, scientifically,
I look at the developing or I look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: development of the vaccine for the COVID
virus as being just an unbelievable
[SPEAKER_04]: technical achievement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand how these mRNA cocktails
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think it's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's great science that underpins it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's totally safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's safer probably than most of the
things that we normally do on a regular
[SPEAKER_04]: basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and remember that vaccines don't save
lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaccinations do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all about just getting that,
you know, level of the virus completely
[SPEAKER_04]: suppressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you need help with the vaccine,
so so be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there I said my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to lazy and thanks, Sam,
for having the cat in the hat wearing a
[SPEAKER_00]: mask in our meetings for a while because I
go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only because I don't want to get a
computer virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, safe practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's time for a bong rep,
I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little after 11.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually only going to go till 11
today because I'm watching my son today
[SPEAKER_06]: and my wife is away.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been very patient on the other side
of the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can chat a little bit more,
maybe for another 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the other thing I wanted to bring
up, Mark, is not to keep on commanding
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation here, but I thought it was
really interesting that Biden let a few
[SPEAKER_04]: people go who had who were using I guess
they had passed marijuana use or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis use that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just so weird because,
you know, his vice president had admitted
[SPEAKER_04]: to smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, where do you draw the line?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it's just again, part of this
hypocrisy that still exists in our country
[SPEAKER_04]: is that association with this plan that
means something to some people,
[SPEAKER_04]: but something completely different to a
different segment of the population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these politicians who try to play both
sides of the fence, try to placate and try
[SPEAKER_04]: to do what they can to sort of stay in the
middle of these issues so they can
[SPEAKER_04]: maximize their political support.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just thought that that was just a
completely bad move, Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't dismiss people for weed smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they?
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they recently had a shortage of
computer coders for the government because
[SPEAKER_04]: they couldn't find people that didn't
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the FBI.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the FBI.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like, you know, they're talking
about pushing this thing through Congress
[SPEAKER_04]: and they got a Democratic Congress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what, you know, the guy's doing
over at the White House.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the total move that totally
backfired.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Jen's Saki is on video talking
about it, trying to backstep on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad move, Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people I know wouldn't have voted
for Biden, except that the choice was
[SPEAKER_01]: Biden or Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to support Biden.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same.
[SPEAKER_08]: On top of that, you can't forget that when
the Obama administration came after my
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary, it came out of the vice
president's office, which was,
[SPEAKER_08]: of course, Joe Biden.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand the choice that we had.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was the guy who tried to forcefully
evict me and successfully did.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I sued him and won and beat him
in federal court.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I understand the fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's more to make you aware of people
that the fight is still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, he is a staunch prohibitionist.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was rather surprising, Mark,
Dr. Mark, that, you know, Kamala gets the
[SPEAKER_08]: pass as his vice president, you know,
because well, and there's probably dozens
[SPEAKER_04]: of other people, A.T.N., right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be dozens of other people
who are either in the administration or in
[SPEAKER_04]: the support organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, OK, pass all those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they live in a city where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's legal in D.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got to prohibit people from
using something that's legal in their own
[SPEAKER_01]: city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to you've got to remember
that Biden truly in his heart still
[SPEAKER_01]: believes marijuana is a gateway gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the core of his belief.
[SPEAKER_08]: And why we have to be especially vigilant
now, people, and why you have to plug in
[SPEAKER_08]: and be active is we have we have access
via Kamala, but we've got a block by the
[SPEAKER_08]: president.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, already Kamala has already
started to backtrack.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we looked at some political bait and
switch already happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is the reason why you have to
stay plugged in locally, like in Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Colorado, where, you know, you have got
to change these laws before they start
[SPEAKER_08]: spreading to other states, because Kevin's
Tibet is isn't stopping to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to sleep tomorrow and wake up
and go to your next state and start
[SPEAKER_08]: passing these laws until you change his
mind and make him stop, which means we've
[SPEAKER_08]: got to go into all these states where he's
going and stop him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, he's going to push and then go
around and tout with his flag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look, we just changed Colorado and
Florida into 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very concerned about that.
I'm very concerned about that just because
of the way we're changing, you know,
if you're saying this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do this, Don.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we get to see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, you need to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, you're a bad state.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to start naming and shaming
these people and calling them out for this
[SPEAKER_08]: bullshit prohibition for what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's you who are watching that have to
do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only a few of us here, but it's your
voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's whether you're going to tolerate this
or not, which hopefully you're not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully you're activating your
friends and make them aware of all this
[SPEAKER_08]: and plugging into local, regional or state
chapters and affecting this change and
[SPEAKER_08]: using your voice and sending emails to
your constituency and writing letters on
[SPEAKER_08]: their behalf or making phone calls because
for every person who calls represents from
[SPEAKER_08]: anywhere from a hundred to a thousand
people here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very important for their
constituency here to call and make people
[SPEAKER_08]: aware because Joe Biden's not going to
stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: If he's kicking people out of his office,
just imagine what he's going to do to the
[SPEAKER_08]: rest of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, work, get to work people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing's changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the person in charge, but the
prohibition is still the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin Sabbath, Kevin Sabbath had a
clubhouse room and in order to get into
[SPEAKER_04]: the room, you had to check that you
weren't going to ask any ridiculous
[SPEAKER_04]: questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess somebody who came into our
room later on, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember this, Colin, was saying that
he got up on the stage and started
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging Sabbath and was immediately
thrown out of the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there was a room full of like
three, four hundred people listening to
[SPEAKER_04]: his unoriginal reefer madness,
you know, campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just amazing that he still has a
fucking audience, you know, three,
[SPEAKER_04]: four hundred people in his clubhouse
listening to that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And why does he have a voice is because
not enough you who are watching or
[SPEAKER_08]: speaking up and shutting down his voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is being allowed to act out openly in
this vacuum because none of you,
[SPEAKER_08]: you lazy people are sitting back and
letting him get away with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if he did, you got thrown out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can go to these states where
they're actually challenging and he's
[SPEAKER_08]: actually going into these state houses.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been in the UN.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friends, Michael Prowitz and Amy King
and Robert Walsh, you are all in the UN
[SPEAKER_08]: and he was there actually pushing those
lies and misinformation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas this handful of activists here in
the United States were actually
[SPEAKER_08]: representing the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how few of you care.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how few of you are paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how few of you are actually getting
involved.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a handful of people, and I know
them personally, who are changing things
[SPEAKER_08]: out the UN.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be doing that, too, but you
don't care enough to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Sabbath makes a business out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a business, a for-profit that he does
this for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, he's motivated because he's got
the mindset and he wants to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would kind of look down at cannabis
people who are doing it for the money,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I say go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can smother him with truth,
then less people will believe his lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can never stop it completely because
there always is people like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is making money off of it, so let's go
hit him where it hurts, where he's trying
[SPEAKER_08]: to change it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it funny the argument that he always
makes which where he parallels big
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco?
[SPEAKER_04]: Big tobacco is going to come in and do
blah blah blah blah, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's big tobacco already done?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit of plague on society with this
thing called nicotine and tar that's
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer causing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's pot calling the kettle
black.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a nicotine delivery system.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wonder how much he's funded by the
tobacco companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he's funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was funded really a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the alcohol companies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but I'm not sure who funds him
anymore because the tobacco companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to buy into cannabis companies,
so they don't want to call their kettle
[SPEAKER_01]: black.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, they just showed up bigly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, a couple of weeks ago,
the alcohol tobacco lobby has already put
[SPEAKER_08]: together their own group and are already
lobbying for change here in the United
[SPEAKER_08]: States.
[SPEAKER_08]: The big bank people are part of that
group, so there's already been
[SPEAKER_08]: reintroduction of the Safe Banking Act
here in the United States so that maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: someday I'll actually have access to a
bank as opposed to being kicked out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: 38 that I've been kicked out of up to this
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the realities we deal with
currently here in the United States is
[SPEAKER_08]: financial institutions will still work for
prohibition, and those like me have also
[SPEAKER_08]: been caught by the IRS through the.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tax code 280 E a year after,
of course, I beat my case won my case
[SPEAKER_08]: against the federal government.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, of course, they hit me with this tax
code 280 E, which basically makes it
[SPEAKER_08]: impossible for you to write off any of
your expenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is still ways that people can
make your life very uncomfortable,
[SPEAKER_08]: even though we have laws in the state that
allow for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, we have to stop these anti
prohibitionists because they're not going
[SPEAKER_08]: to stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we have to be eternally
vigilant with our crusade, because they
[SPEAKER_08]: are as well, because as as Sam said,
they are financially tied to that reality
[SPEAKER_08]: and funded by others in realities that
don't like the reality we're trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: support with the one that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Biden is not going to change his mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, the guy is a dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we need to get somebody who is more
cannabis friendly and a Democrat,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a liberal, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I just know that Biden is not our guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Biden is also not hash church material.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be talking about something much
more elevating than Joe Biden wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: come on Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would beg you to let him on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's never going to ask or don't
worry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't even really feel the
conversation is worth going much deeper
[SPEAKER_06]: into personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that, you know, the people that are
listening would much rather hear us talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about, you know, processing hash or
growing cannabis or getting it to express
[SPEAKER_06]: itself or explaining chemistry about it or
hearing more from Cairo about the activism
[SPEAKER_06]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything but but but American politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably right, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I brought that up again.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's two strikes against me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we could talk about something that
we do have a deep appreciation for
[SPEAKER_06]: different from Joe Biden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we could talk about the cannabis
and the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, both of those things are the
reason why I can't come and hang out with
[SPEAKER_04]: you right now, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love nothing more than getting
on a plane tomorrow and hang out with you
[SPEAKER_04]: for like a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why I can't do that is
because, A, there's a stupid fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: pandemic and B, our fucking government's
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, would you have to do a
quarantine if you came back from Canada?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I have to pay some kind of
fine or some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's all fucked up, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't come.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's I think there's permission that
you can get.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you came here, you'd have to be on
in quarantine for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be pretty much live on plaster on
hash church.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon as I can get to Canada, as soon as I
can get there, as soon as there's
[SPEAKER_04]: physically a mechanism, I will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will come and I will visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, we'll have you come by
the lab and I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been we've been.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have we talked about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of crazy that we're both in
these labs five days and I'll convince
[SPEAKER_06]: Colin to come with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's too bad we're not able to do
stuff like that because I have done more
[SPEAKER_06]: than I've almost ever done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like even in the last 20 years,
I feel like I've done more in the last two
[SPEAKER_06]: here at it with Embark and Whistler
Technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no one's really been able to kind of
see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just been you know, and we haven't
really been like flexing on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff, you know, just little bits here and
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not like operating like a post
every single day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like more like once every three weeks
or something really slow, not gaining a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of traction on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But but doing doing things that would be
would be fun to be able to share.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully once all of this is over,
we'll be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the force, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like remember, on Star Wars, they talked
about the force.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to post anything you force.
[SPEAKER_06]: May the force be with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: May the force be with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: My six year old son is getting dangerously
close to wanting to watch Star Wars for
[SPEAKER_06]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been playing with like Lego,
Darth Vader's and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, kind of knows the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were talking about it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, Yeah, dad, I think I'm
almost ready for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a neat thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a little guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that shit in the theater.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how old I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing up with your kids and seeing it
all over again is so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I did it with my first two kids,
and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have this other opportunity that
almost feels like he should be my
[SPEAKER_06]: grandchild that this you know,
like a 12 years later, but indeed,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's my child.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're gonna we're gonna have to do it
again, probably the last time I'll do it
[SPEAKER_06]: with my own child.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next time, it'll be a grandchild.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here's a kicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took my brother who was blind in 1977 to
actually see Star Wars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, my job was to explain what
the fuck was going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me tell you, to an eight year old
trying to explain exactly what was going
[SPEAKER_08]: on as it was going on was mind bogglingly
numbing in the sense of trying to explain
[SPEAKER_08]: there's this big hairy ape talking to this
guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, uh huh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's challenging.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: But love Star Wars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad that your kids are into it
and possibly getting into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fun story.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's based off samurai movies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's a Kirikusawa.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you go look at a lot of what
George Lucas did there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: retelling of great Japanese tales by a
great Japanese director.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just made by Americans and switched
centuries all together and put it into
[SPEAKER_08]: space.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, shout out to Kirikusawa for
being the absolute originator.
[SPEAKER_08]: There I said it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Mojave's in the chat room and on
YouTube and Joe Benny, a couple familiar
[SPEAKER_06]: faces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your hash joint coming soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Mojave's been crushing it in
clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a couple a couple things where
it's like, you know, for for those who are
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding and for those who are doing what
he does, he just tells it just the way it
[SPEAKER_04]: is, you know, I mean, it's just an
incredible wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm gonna back on hash church again
one of these days soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to send out the invites each week
but sometimes I'm last minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are the core group right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are the guys I can tell like the
morning of and you'll be like,
[SPEAKER_06]: hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these other people need to need a
little bit more a couple more days notice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm glad that Mojave has found a way
to get his voice out there because it is
[SPEAKER_08]: such a valuable voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one reason I happy to be a business
with him and Rob through bioeconomics
[SPEAKER_08]: group is just the breadth of knowledge is
and what they're doing is exponential.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, they've been so in the
underground world doing it for so many
[SPEAKER_08]: decades.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their breadth of knowledge is exponential.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we need more Dr. Marks.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more Mojave's.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more Rob Clark's out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, go out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your education so that properly in
college.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, then you can go on and actually do
these things proper in ways that you gotta
[SPEAKER_08]: know the rules, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Marks before you absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was really funny because I think
it was Thursday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got pinged by I forget I wasn't Colin
because I know Colin you ping me a lot but
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a room called THC and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, this sounds interesting and
I was driving home.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I can't talk when I'm driving home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just put it on and listen, you know,
but I got invited up to to speak and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, four hours later, you know,
I mean, we were in that **** room for four
[SPEAKER_04]: hours talking and Michael Bacchus was in
there and he's just got all kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting information.
[SPEAKER_04]: My god.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a wealth of information and his
stories are **** funnier than **** and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's like, I gotta leave the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in here too long.
[SPEAKER_04]: He left and about 10 minutes later,
he was back until the until the end of the
[SPEAKER_04]: night.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was just it went on and on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even started texting Colin because man,
I'm four hours in this room and my wife's
[SPEAKER_04]: wondering.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what is this clubhouse thing
every night?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like and and like even with
Hash Church Mark, you'll get a kick out of
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many other how many other
panelists get this but my wife will ask me
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday is there a Hash Church trying to
plan out the weekend?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, okay, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I lose Mark for like four or five
hours?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is he part of like, will he be part of
like what we're what the rest of my family
[SPEAKER_04]: does?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm sure that every panelists gets
that from their spouse but yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: this clubhouse thing is really it's been a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those rooms take on a life of their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of animated performers in it
and for a while, that room only got down
[SPEAKER_04]: to like about six people, seven people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, hey, maybe we should let this
thing go and then like an hour later,
[SPEAKER_04]: it blew up to like about forty people
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, there's a lot of people hungry
for the knowledge that we got and it's so
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting to hear Michael and Mojave and
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: This fella Adam in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned an awful lot from and some of
the growers that come in are just really
[SPEAKER_04]: just it's just killer to hear,
you know, their knowledge and their
[SPEAKER_04]: stories.
[SPEAKER_08]: Michael is an amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis Pharmacy, The Practical Guide to
Medical Marijuana is a key book of
[SPEAKER_08]: information and yeah, I read him oddly
enough, Dr. Mark in Maui.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just at Maui one time and I was
like, Bacchus?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, he's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was actually in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you guys have the same hairdo,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to step into the shade for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Way too much sunshine.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was there for a medical marijuana
convention on the island that I was
[SPEAKER_08]: unaware of.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then I went and popped over and checked
out, you know, what was going on there and
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, Marcus, he would be a great guy to
get on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he can break that and he gets
really if you follow him on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's been posting these these groups of
strains based on
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene prevalence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to butcher it, but I've only
looked at him like really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at it, it'll have like a
list of the terpenes and then like groups
[SPEAKER_04]: of different strains that we all know and
how they're grouped based on the terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: prevalence and the terpene profiles of
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really just done some fantastic work
and he's a creative guy and he's really
[SPEAKER_04]: bubbly and effortless.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a great guy for events.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would be great to get on Hashchurch,
Mark, if we can get him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, on top of that, yeah, he has his own
company.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's called Perfect, but it was
also the consultants for Maui Grown,
[SPEAKER_08]: which are basically seed to sale and has
done amazing things with that dispensary
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I would second bringing him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't have a copy of his book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get a copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard his book is really good and he
said he's writing a new edition.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, with this thing, it just keeps
on getting there's so much information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure it becomes extremely
voluminous to reduce it down to just a
[SPEAKER_04]: book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been updated at a few times already.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, he's doing it even more so
because he is one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last time I saw him, he's like,
yeah, I'm going through about 1400
[SPEAKER_08]: articles on cannabis and I'm about a
halfway through.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he is a researcher.
[SPEAKER_08]: His nerds nerd and his way to also retain
it and spring it back to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you have to have an actual the
source and dictionary right there to start
[SPEAKER_08]: going through what he starts talking
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can see Bubble Man has the sun and
it looks like it's about our time to get
[SPEAKER_08]: off.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to shut up and appreciate
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for allowing us to space
