[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's see, we're going live here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, let's see.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, looks like we are live.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, everybody, to Hash Church 5.0,
episode three.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am just going to be letting some folks
in here real quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: See what we got.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Mr. Kevin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's a beautiful shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, how about yourself?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's my fault.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me check my audio real quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, that's my fault.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have got my speaker set up to the wrong
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good day, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Long time no see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how long was the Hash Church hiatus?
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't... You know, it was just under a
year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just under a year.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's been... Hash Church,
when it started, it was this unique sort
[SPEAKER_11]: of timeline where we were all so excited
to really share everything we were doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all of a sudden this legal system
came into play and people became more
[SPEAKER_11]: protective of their IPs and of the things
they were sharing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just seemed like everyone was kind
of going their own separate ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: It seemed like a very natural hiatus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of thought someone would pick it up
and take it over and there would be still
[SPEAKER_11]: places for people to gather.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Kyle Cushman has done a good job.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a few others that have...
[SPEAKER_11]: That are pretty impressive, but I just
kind of felt like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to be doing this again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time to get the plan back together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think right now what's happened is
the Zoom link changed and now I've got to
[SPEAKER_11]: send it out again to everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just sent an email.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Colin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, long time no see, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: What have you been up to aside from
testifying in front of the Senate and
[SPEAKER_11]: doing all this wild stuff?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been active on... I haven't taken
our eye off the cannabis front,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's just been a little less vocal
lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's good to get on here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll share everything we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The COVID stuff was a big deep dive,
but it had to be done.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciated it personally.
[SPEAKER_11]: I particularly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a really good conversation with my
mother about it the other day in regards
[SPEAKER_11]: to...
[SPEAKER_11]: I just like the conversation to be open on
both ends.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the dialogue, not kind of stunting
one side of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just let people have the dialogue.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very good at polarizing people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is their art.
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, it certainly hit our
field.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was going to say you must have
been feeling it for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Colin.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might be seeing you in Puerto Rico,
huh?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: How crazy that that's going to intersect,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know you're down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're doing some work down in the
island?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I consult with Pritch Biotech,
the largest producer down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a limited market.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: A limited market.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you go down there and say,
well, you guys want to become a state.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: We like being in US territory because
there's all kinds of tax incentive to do
[SPEAKER_12]: manufacturing down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the pharmaceutical companies have been
down there for 60 or 80 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's huge manufacturing facilities
for everything from over-the-counter to
[SPEAKER_12]: injectables to everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's these huge facilities
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the facility that they're in right
there, they used to make a leave or
[SPEAKER_12]: something.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was an old J&J facility.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's huge.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the largest indoor facility that I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I mean, all the challenges of
just being down there, just like supply
[SPEAKER_12]: chain issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they get hit.
[SPEAKER_12]: When the hurricane comes in, it basically
knocks out power to half the island.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have their own substation right
there because they have so much power
[SPEAKER_12]: online and everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, our guy, John Carlo's file is
down there as their chief operating
[SPEAKER_12]: officer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we connected, Kevin, with a guy named
Sam Heinmarsch.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that his name?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's from MBC.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to connect and make sure
that there's facility tours and maybe,
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's medical down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they do reciprocate.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you have a patient license from a
state, you can get stuff in the Puerto
[SPEAKER_12]: Rico dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a rec timeline on the island?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there is.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's kind of like wanting to,
you know, my buddy was telling me before I
[SPEAKER_12]: went down to Puerto Rico, he goes,
yeah, it's just all wise guys and pirates
[SPEAKER_12]: down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's kind of been kind of like
a, I would say, a legacy market there for
[SPEAKER_12]: any drug you could possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Caribbean, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like it's all tourism
dollars.
[SPEAKER_12]: And San Juan is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: And old San Juan is just absolutely just
like, you know, just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, cobblestone streets, just empanada
stands on the corner.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just, it's just rich with,
with that type of Mediterranean history.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys are having your gigs.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we're talking about here is CanMed
2025, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I right?
2025?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're a quarter of the way through the
century.
[SPEAKER_12]: CanMed 2025 is going to be down in Puerto
Rico.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the name of the resort?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Wyndham Resort, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wyndham.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of out on the Eastern end,
Northeastern end of the island.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mark, I think CanMed is probably one of
the best events that no one in our
[SPEAKER_09]: industry really focuses on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they should because of the impact they
can make in terms of innovation and who's
[SPEAKER_09]: doing the real work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's one of the biggest
takeaways that I've, I've learned from
[SPEAKER_09]: what Kevin and his team's put together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I, I really need to get
down there, Kevin, to, to participate with
[SPEAKER_09]: you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Puerto Rico's the time, baby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I, I missed my opportunity to
create an abstract for you guys,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I think I'd like to do that in the
future to, to really participate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send one in for 25.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's, I'm sure the window's
still open.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, life is, is happening
around me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's only so much I can, only so many
hours in a day.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but yeah, I, I'd love to see Mark,
you put together an abstract, to be
[SPEAKER_09]: honest, and speak on the work that you've
been doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, I mean, there's just,
there's just so much to talk about.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like, in that audience,
I mean, Kevin, you remember, like I came
[SPEAKER_12]: and talked there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were at the first one, weren't you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he walked into Harvard Medical.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was 2017, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause you guys did 2016 and Mishulam came
to that one, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Raffy just phoned in for mine because I
don't think he was feeling well or he
[SPEAKER_12]: wasn't traveling or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you guys have had this connection with
Raffy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should talk about that, Kevin,
because as you know, I mean, he inspired
[SPEAKER_12]: me and everything that I've done since
I've been doing chemistry and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_12]: all just because being acquainted with
everything that Raffy and all the
[SPEAKER_12]: researchers that came before Raffy,
you know, like atoms and I just,
[SPEAKER_12]: everyone was fascinated in the chemistry
of this planet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: When Raffy came in, but you know,
to have that connection and for him to
[SPEAKER_12]: inspire new generations of scientists to
get in, like now when you go to the ICRS,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's mostly not phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all endo, more endo cannabinoid than
phyto cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think the great thing about CanMed
is it kind of brings the phyto and the
[SPEAKER_12]: endo community together and looks for the
obvious intersection, which is,
[SPEAKER_12]: is there therapeutic use?
[SPEAKER_12]: And having people like Bonnie and all
those other doctors that you guys have
[SPEAKER_12]: signed up actually show real world
results.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, here is the tumor before,
here's the tumor after.
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys have had it at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I came there in 2017.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when you guys were still doing this
at Harvard Medical School, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And held up a vial of HHC and told a group
of medical doctors that I dabbed it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: This won't trigger a piss test.
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_12]: And this was years before.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was basically a year before the
farm bill.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a year before the whole Delta 8 HHC
alphabet soup of cannabinoids sort of
[SPEAKER_12]: exploded onto the scene.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, man, just in a short period of time,
we've seen a real big transition in the
[SPEAKER_12]: industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And CanMed, you guys have been covering it
all along.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great venue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rafi was, if there's one word to sum him
up, it's generous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he just gave everyone time and he
was not a divisive individual.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he'd listen to anybody and
welcome anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he was just a very unifying voice that
will be sorely missed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So very saddened by his departure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, those were, that was interesting
times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I remember your talk specifically
because it was, you brought in that vial
[SPEAKER_08]: of HHC and showed it to everyone in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: HHC, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And only at Harvard Med School would that
fly, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, but I think it was kind of like the
writing on the wall.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this hemp thing now is taking
over the regulated cannabis markets,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you guys not see that?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it seems like all these big
multi-state operators now, like even Juana
[SPEAKER_12]: now has a hemp-derived play.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saved you something from a CBD
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you'd get a kick out of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, and is that stuff safe to
eat?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know who the fuck knows,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't come from the flower,
as Mark will tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But someone's been someone's been spraying
it on.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, so how do you compete with
an eight dollar vape pen at the gas
[SPEAKER_12]: station when the dispensary wants 40 or 50
bucks?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we fix this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it, Mark, I think it goes back to
policy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the lack of understanding as to what
these constituents and chemical compounds
[SPEAKER_09]: are actually doing to, you know,
any single consumer at any given time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And based on the extraction method,
as you've kind of blatantly and simply
[SPEAKER_09]: pointed out, we don't really have a clean,
fair way to show transparency through the
[SPEAKER_09]: whole process.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it is transparency, you're showing
all the dirt and you're showing all the
[SPEAKER_09]: bad that, you know, in disguise of good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are going in for wellness and
coming out with different problems based
[SPEAKER_09]: off of chemistry that is bad chemistry.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and is it clean and how are
those constituents going to affect a human
[SPEAKER_09]: in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let the plant do the chemistry and harvest
the heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my God, if everybody could have
Cubans white sift hash, we wouldn't need
[SPEAKER_12]: all these other.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's kind of like, you know,
again, I've said this a bunch of times,
[SPEAKER_12]: including on Hash Church, as long as the
there's prohibition anywhere, there'll be
[SPEAKER_12]: a black market everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you can look at just just.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the compression of margins along
the supply chain has basically weeded out
[SPEAKER_12]: like a lot of people who cannot compete
with THC that's made an order of magnitude
[SPEAKER_12]: cheaper than you can grow it for.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you just there's no competition.
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot compete it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a race to the bottom and in a
commoditized market, price will always
[SPEAKER_12]: win.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how we can get this change.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some interesting studies in
California about pesticides that are that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're finding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the LA Times study came out
showing this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I spoke to the journalist there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Page St. John is her name.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's interesting that they're like
they did this study in Canada where they
[SPEAKER_08]: looked at three hundred twenty seven
pesticides that which is a large panel for
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying to capture pesticides that
are outside of the demanded testing
[SPEAKER_08]: regimen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they found like 92 percent of the
black market flower up there was was laden
[SPEAKER_08]: with pesticides, sometimes a thousand
times over the limits and then only like
[SPEAKER_08]: six percent positivity in the tested
market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior to Canada going legal, that number
was more like 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it looks like what's happening up there
is the the the the actual legal markets
[SPEAKER_08]: going down because they're testing in
terms of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the black market is going up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like the dumping ground for
everything that fails.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when Page was doing this work in
California, it was a it's a bit different
[SPEAKER_08]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're finding pens that are in the black
market that don't have any pesticides,
[SPEAKER_08]: probably because they're chemically
synthesized.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it brings in a whole nother order
synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it brings in a whole nother set of
tests they got to look for on the black
[SPEAKER_08]: market pens to assess safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're they're sometimes finding THC in
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're finding all of these bizarre
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, since they're synthetic,
they're not they're not necessarily coming
[SPEAKER_08]: along with a high high pesticide content.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just seen so much stuff in the legal
market and transitioning from the black
[SPEAKER_10]: market and like stuff that I think a lot
of people are even aware of it,
[SPEAKER_10]: that they even have it in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's systemically in their plant
when they're their clones, when the clones
[SPEAKER_10]: that they got.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it'll work in the extraction,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Ethan Russo showed that that some
of these pesticides really, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: you might go from 20 to 80 percent on the
cannabinoids, but the pesticides can go
[SPEAKER_08]: from parts per million to parts per
thousand.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the extraction process from flour is
different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was in the impression most of
the Delta 8 there was made from almost
[SPEAKER_08]: crystal with CBD, which should be fairly
pure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those pens, ironically, some of them
are going to be cleaner than I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_08]: say cleaner.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're they're less pesticide laden than
what you might find in the in the legal
[SPEAKER_08]: market.
[SPEAKER_08]: But God knows what the hell's in them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They may not be Delta.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be may not be Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be, you know, some of these.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chris Hidalgo was like laughing at me to
use what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: He goes, yeah, you look at like all this
stuff that's being tested for pesticides
[SPEAKER_12]: and it came out of a chemical reaction
vessel where there are pesticides and
[SPEAKER_12]: hopefully you're using a cheap CBD isolate
that's pretty pure.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there are any trace amounts of
pesticides in there, you hope that in the
[SPEAKER_12]: process of distillation or whatever
purification process they're using,
[SPEAKER_12]: they're able to to get rid of those
things.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that the problem, I think,
is is bigger, which is that all this
[SPEAKER_12]: regulation that's required, you do license
production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to have your your in some
cases, even your business pro forma vetted
[SPEAKER_12]: by all these regulators in the state who
want to make sure that you know how to run
[SPEAKER_12]: a profitable business.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to do all kinds of community
outreach.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to make sure that your spit is
zoned correctly.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to do FBI background checks.
[SPEAKER_12]: The hemp industry doesn't have to do any
of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All they have to do is basically take bulk
biomass, produce ingredients or just have
[SPEAKER_12]: like a warehouse that buys those
ingredients until you can pull in,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, all the minors are all available
in isolate form.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of those are chemical synthesized.
[SPEAKER_12]: But Kevin, the the high CBG a varieties
that are out there right now have
[SPEAKER_12]: basically cratered the price of CBG.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you see a lot of, you know,
just products with CBG in it, like
[SPEAKER_12]: seltzers, sodas, nummies, all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the hemp bill, remember that they
didn't they didn't contemplate what was
[SPEAKER_12]: going to happen after the hemp was
harvested, because that should be
[SPEAKER_12]: regulated by the Food and Drug
Administration.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can't just put CBD into a because
that's in violation of the Food,
[SPEAKER_12]: Drug and Drug Administration.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cosmetic DAC, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they never contemplated the whole CBD
business, let alone CBN, CBG, all the
[SPEAKER_12]: other alphabet soup.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you have all these crazy
molecules, which don't come from CBD or
[SPEAKER_12]: hemp at all, that are just being
synthesized, right, like HHCP and all that
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they're finding that THC acetate
generates ketene when you heat it up on
[SPEAKER_12]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just all kinds of crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all of this regulatory overhead is
theater at the moment, because they're not
[SPEAKER_08]: policing it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, not at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't police it, then they're just
putting the raising the price of the legal
[SPEAKER_08]: market next to the black market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and then all the business that are in
the legal arena have like two hands tied
[SPEAKER_08]: behind their back.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't write off their business
expenses due to 280.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to build facilities in every
state because they can't move product
[SPEAKER_08]: across state lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just they can't get banking,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just a disaster for them
economically.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're collecting all of this tax
stuff to float that side of the image of
[SPEAKER_08]: the regulatory market.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're not running around policing
any of the lab testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like if the lab testing is what's
supposed to detect this stuff and
[SPEAKER_08]: differentiate it, I think we all as a
community have to pound on them to get
[SPEAKER_08]: that data public and let the policing
happen real time, because having right now
[SPEAKER_08]: what's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been diving into this little bit
with lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is because of a talk at Canmet
this year from Yasha Khan.
[SPEAKER_08]: He showed some data showing all the THC
lab shopping and some data on like yeast
[SPEAKER_08]: and mold lab shopping that's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's clear that a lot of states have
this data showing that there are labs in
[SPEAKER_08]: states that like pass everything,
and they've been doing it for years,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they don't they don't act.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all the grows get painted into an
economic corner and end up having to test
[SPEAKER_08]: with the labs that pass everything and
give them higher THC numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all the legitimate labs like
Chris's lab and others, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: financially struggling.
[SPEAKER_08]: They like to be the ones that get the data
and get it to the level and get squeezed
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alex has a taste on this for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of lab, morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, likewise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to jump in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were part of the LA Times expose and
it's incredibly revealing, obviously.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there's a bunch of things
to kind of hit on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't kind of go deep on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: but one thing I wanted to hit on kind of
part of this conversation is, when a state
[SPEAKER_07]: puts testing regulations in place,
that kind of essentially makes testing the
[SPEAKER_07]: final check in the integrity of the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there's no integrity in that
because the state's not overly regulating
[SPEAKER_07]: and auditing the labs, then yeah,
it creates these holes where everything
[SPEAKER_07]: goes through, whether that's, I mean,
it's been really sad like up until,
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, California sitting on their hand
effectively and not doing anything to
[SPEAKER_07]: regulators to actually enforce and ensure
integrity and testing over five year
[SPEAKER_07]: period of legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all but destroyed the entire market
and led to the extinction level event that
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of small craft farmers and people
have gone through, you know, because at a
[SPEAKER_07]: certain point, you know, there becomes an
economic disincentive for people to want
[SPEAKER_07]: to work with a good lab that's going to
give them accurate quality repeatable
[SPEAKER_07]: data, because they can just chase the 50%
flower, literally, we see that it's been a
[SPEAKER_07]: huge thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever we're publishing something at 26,
and it's 48% from this other lab,
[SPEAKER_07]: why work with us, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever that same lab will pass you and
never fail a test for aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides, whatever it is, you know,
why chance it with us, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So there becomes this disincentive to even
want to work with a good lab, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: but, you know, thank JAW, you know,
at the beginning of this year,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the state, you know,
there was a big shift, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the state lab came online, they have one
down SoCal that we're working with the
[SPEAKER_07]: University of San Diego, one up in Hayward
or in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you've been tracking the news,
you know, there's been more recalls this
[SPEAKER_07]: year than there's been in the last five
years combined, you know, and if you kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of tracked, you know, it's really been
around potency labeling, inflated potency,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as for aspergillus, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't been about pesticides,
because they haven't had those
[SPEAKER_07]: capabilities internally.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, essentially, now that this
is kind of, you know, because,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think that's one of the big things
that, you know, the hope of California
[SPEAKER_07]: regulation was going to help button up,
you know, learning lessons from previous
[SPEAKER_07]: states mistakes, you know, to have a
comprehensive lab program to test the
[SPEAKER_07]: testers, to do the secret shopping,
pulling products off shelves, testing the
[SPEAKER_07]: product, you know, and kind of making sure
that there's integrity of the testing side
[SPEAKER_07]: of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that wasn't a thing for,
you know, the last four years,
[SPEAKER_07]: this year, it's been a thing, you know,
and then when the LA Times expose a
[SPEAKER_07]: dropped, you know, kind of that was after
California, you know, Department of
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis Control kind of had a $5 million
campaign to, you know, kind of propaganda
[SPEAKER_07]: around why the legal market so great,
and everything's, you know, clean compared
[SPEAKER_07]: to the black market.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, boom, the LA Times expose a
dropped and really kind of showed,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because when Paige St. John
reached out to us in February early this
[SPEAKER_07]: year, you know, she was kind of writing
the story about how it was an expose on
[SPEAKER_07]: how California regulators failing to do
their job and enact what's in the what was
[SPEAKER_07]: in the regulations to kind of create a
state run lab that's secret shopping,
[SPEAKER_07]: testing the testers.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fact that they hadn't done that,
basically, the point of the article was
[SPEAKER_07]: around how failed regulators not doing
their job to enact this has led to
[SPEAKER_07]: compromise public health and consumer
safety at the retail level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they went and bought 70 something
products off shelves, they fully
[SPEAKER_07]: anonymized all the products, you know,
took flour out of packaging, gummies out
[SPEAKER_07]: of packaging, cartridges out of packaging,
they anonymized whatever logos to run the
[SPEAKER_07]: cartridges, and then they split the
samples sent half to us, half in Resco in
[SPEAKER_07]: San Francisco, on Nesco and is often the
lab that we get compared to whenever
[SPEAKER_07]: people have questions to confirm pesticide
data.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have very comparable tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the only thing that they published
in the LA Times expose what is what was
[SPEAKER_07]: double blind confirmed between us and then
Resco.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, it was really in really
fascinating, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: flour had 30% fail rate or so,
you know, kind of, it was really for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you saw chlorophenipure,
hyperbolic oxide, pyrethrin, bifenthrin,
[SPEAKER_07]: those are all bug bomb aerosol pesticides,
insecticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, and they're insecticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: But more so there are these total release
foggers, you know, and there's been this
[SPEAKER_07]: thing like, because I used to be in the
hydroponics industry before we opened SC
[SPEAKER_07]: labs, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and whenever we whenever,
whenever I was in the hydrostore,
[SPEAKER_07]: there was this very common practice and
cultivation where in between harvests and
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor farms, people used to basically
sterilize their rooms, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: by then spray their walls, scrub the
tables, do whatever would serve sanitation
[SPEAKER_07]: agents.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they would take these 10,000
square foot greenhouse fathers,
[SPEAKER_07]: they would light them off in 500 to 1000
square foot rooms that are made out of
[SPEAKER_07]: sheetrock and drywall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they would basically totally release
fog, these bug bombs that permeates every
[SPEAKER_07]: surface area of that space, and it sucks
into an absorbers into the drywall and
[SPEAKER_07]: sheetrock, and then it sits around and
then the next harvest, they do it and the
[SPEAKER_07]: next harvest, they do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And essentially, there becomes this like,
contamination, hyper contamination factor
[SPEAKER_07]: that builds into the sheetrock and
drywall, you can test the drywall and
[SPEAKER_07]: like, huge part per million levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happens is every time that,
you know, temperature humidity,
[SPEAKER_07]: differentials, you know, hit peaks,
you know, whatever, levels, there's this
[SPEAKER_07]: off gassing that happens years after its
original use.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whenever anytime we see like,
because we do a lot of root cause
[SPEAKER_07]: analysis, forensic investigations,
when people fail, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's there's a huge kind of correlation to
you see, you see, if you see like
[SPEAKER_07]: chlorophane appear, pyranol butane oxide,
pyrethane, bifenthrin, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there, there's a three different bug
bombs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's this, you know, when we see
that, you know, you can guarantee it's an
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor cultivation, where these bombs are
dropped.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people might not even have used them
for the last year or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's still showing up, you know,
so that was one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, but the more damning
kind of, I think, realization from it was
[SPEAKER_07]: around cartridges, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and in some of the worst example,
the cartridges had like a 65% fail rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in some of the cartridges,
there was 10 to 20 pesticides detectable,
[SPEAKER_07]: quantifiable, and 10 of those were in
failing levels, a lot of them were 100,000
[SPEAKER_07]: time levels, you know, like, you know,
so is it and you don't see that no farmers
[SPEAKER_07]: spraying that many pesticides,
those types of concentrations,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that's 100% indicative of closed
loop extraction processes, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it's butane extraction,
whether it's CO2, whether it's
[SPEAKER_07]: distillation, you know, like the people
that are most on it, what we've learned
[SPEAKER_07]: people that can kind of, you know,
there's a lot of clients that we work with
[SPEAKER_07]: in the state of California that have a non
detect level standard across the board,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they screen material, they micro
extract it before they even commit to
[SPEAKER_07]: purchasing material, so that they know
what's coming into their extraction closed
[SPEAKER_07]: loop system, you know, so and and if there
is ever anything, they know what's there
[SPEAKER_07]: so that they can very effectively
thoroughly flush their thumbs,
[SPEAKER_07]: compartmentalize the gas, etc,
etc.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what that what happens is,
when nobody is cleaning their instruments
[SPEAKER_07]: in between, and there's running material
from this farm and this farm and this
[SPEAKER_07]: farm, you know, one dude's herpes comes
in, the next dude's cut syphilis,
[SPEAKER_07]: the next dude's gonorrhea, the next,
you know, so the next thing you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's herpe gonosyphilates, you know,
in the extraction machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if you then run hundreds of
pounds of clean material, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: all of that load carries over and
concentrates in the material, and it just
[SPEAKER_07]: keeps carrying over and concentrating.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so whenever people that are on the
extraction side of things are just getting
[SPEAKER_07]: clean, non detect results from some
fraudulent lab, they you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: they operate and move forward with this
false sense of security, that everything's
[SPEAKER_07]: good, there's no issues, a little they
know there's this super concentration
[SPEAKER_07]: magnification factors happening,
you know, that then next thing you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's 10 to 20 pesticides at super
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's a really big thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, for what it's worth,
it just like smeared shit all over the
[SPEAKER_07]: space of the DCC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really showed kind of how big of an
issue this is, you know, not just around
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of lab fraudulence, but just about
how hyper contaminated things like
[SPEAKER_07]: cartridges and other things that come from
close up extraction can be.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, I just so thankful we're
tossing we're tossing a big fat softball
[SPEAKER_08]: to people like Alex Berenson, who I love
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: But his you know, he's running around
saying this shit's all causing
[SPEAKER_08]: schizophrenia and violence or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's everyone in this audience knows
those studies are all done with like
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana that no one ever tests.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got no idea what's in that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet, this pesticide issue,
if you look up a lot of these insecticides
[SPEAKER_08]: and pesticides, they have like psychosis
listed, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They there's neurological artifacts that
can occur.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, like two neurons shifted to
pesticides of the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Neurology is a major aspect of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm living with a family member
as Parkinson's, so I deeply understand the
[SPEAKER_09]: neurology of of what happens to a human
when things start to go sideways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's it's really,
you know, it's concerning on multiple
[SPEAKER_09]: levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a couple of things that you said,
Alec really came to mind in my experience
[SPEAKER_09]: in California with working with several
farms across the state is keeping
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody honest.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I you know, and then here's
another side of your story is the
[SPEAKER_09]: marketing aspect of product.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've been mandated as a product
developer to make a certain percentage
[SPEAKER_09]: point before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's troubling because that's not
how this works.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't just design, you know,
you know, 99 proof product that's going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be amazing on all the touch points that we
all love.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to just create a 95
percent THC product and have it resonate
[SPEAKER_09]: across every single segment.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everyone's going to love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's inherently something wrong with
that mentality.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that good product comes from good
genetics, good growing practices and good,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, good marketing of that
particular product to that person.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not about a percentage point.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not about, you know, how it's going
to make you feel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, again, it goes back to the basic
of what we all understand is that it's all
[SPEAKER_09]: individual and we all have to learn about
these products and how they bind with us
[SPEAKER_09]: as people and how our receptors,
you know, bind with those those
[SPEAKER_09]: constituents there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's it's a big problem
because on two sides of the coin,
[SPEAKER_09]: you have people marketing and then you
have people shopping that idea of
[SPEAKER_09]: marketing to create a narrative that
really is a false narrative, because
[SPEAKER_09]: that's not actually how the plant works.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not how well, you know, so I think
that's another aspect of the conversation
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to bring a little bit of light,
because that's been my experience with
[SPEAKER_09]: this is I've been asked to lab shop and
then I call these labs out being like,
[SPEAKER_09]: guys, this is not what's in this.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is way too high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, where are you getting 98 percent
from?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not the constituents of this were
these varietals that we made this
[SPEAKER_09]: formulation and these percentage points
and amounted of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sure, from these these initial COA
points, you can amount to a general,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, area of high 80s.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to see like 96 percent, 97 kind of
made me question everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I spent my life dealing with all of
this in developing high level products for
[SPEAKER_09]: several several markets at once.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was it just ripped open the doors
of of deception on me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just I was the one being saying,
no, guys, actually, this is what the
[SPEAKER_09]: constituents were.
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be here or generally around
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they went to be like,
oh, yeah, you're kind of right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is this it is that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you do have a dichotomy here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to kind of bring that up
because it's there's two drivers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have agriculture and then you have
marketing and sales or really three
[SPEAKER_09]: because you have you have to market and
then sell it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think those together make a really,
really interesting cocktail that needs to
[SPEAKER_09]: be addressed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think that's I mean, ultimately,
what everyone's talking about here is
[SPEAKER_13]: California, because we're talking about
California and California is a big model,
[SPEAKER_13]: a hyper model for cannabis globally,
really.
[SPEAKER_13]: California dropped the ball in all in a
lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: California, the fifth largest economy in
the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Agriculture, it's a big, you know,
it's they just didn't have the foresight
[SPEAKER_13]: to really roll this out and actually maybe
not just lacking foresight, but lacking
[SPEAKER_13]: desire, lacking integrity, not treating it
like other crops.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, even today, you know, the
California, the CDFA, puts out an annual
[SPEAKER_13]: crop statistics report, you know,
on all different crops.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about it talks about inputs.
[SPEAKER_13]: It talks about pesticide costs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Each county, what each county spends and
everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: California is not even I mean,
cannabis isn't even in that report.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not even there's not even an
honorable mention that say, hey,
[SPEAKER_13]: we can't talk about it because of federal
federal regulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like it's the largest cash crop in the
state and it's not treated like a crop.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the divide between agriculture and the
the community, the culture, the marketing,
[SPEAKER_13]: everything was just a complete dropping of
the ball.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the pesticide thing example,
I remember.
[SPEAKER_13]: But 2015, me and Rob were kind of in a
circle of people talking about like,
[SPEAKER_13]: hey, what would you guys do if you were
rolling out legal cannabis in California?
[SPEAKER_13]: And Alec, the first thing I thought of was
my experience in hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a dirty, dirty world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And everyone thinks everyone in cannabis
is all cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: And hey, now we're all brothers and we're
all here and we're it's all about the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_13]: In California, cannabis was about money
and people flocked to this state from all
[SPEAKER_13]: over the world to grow cannabis,
to make a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cool way to make money.
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, the hydro shops were feeding
the industry with a lot of either outlawed
[SPEAKER_13]: or nonaccessible pesticides.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when and to me, I'm like, wow,
you can't let that happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't let that be unregulated and then
have agriculture exist over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, so when we got a license down in L
.A.
[SPEAKER_13]: and I have a friend who had the local
hydro shop and I'd go and walk in and say,
[SPEAKER_13]: hey, buddy, and buy some stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd sit there and listen to him time and
time again, say to people, are you
[SPEAKER_13]: licensed or not?
[SPEAKER_13]: And the are not part, they walk them in
the back and they pull out, they open up
[SPEAKER_13]: the door, the trap door, you know,
the deal, and they pull out the door.
[SPEAKER_13]: They pull out countless over and over
again, pesticides that and then they give
[SPEAKER_13]: it to them in an unlabeled bottle with no
instructions at all on how to use it,
[SPEAKER_13]: with maybe a Sharpie on the side that says
like two point five mil per gallon or
[SPEAKER_13]: something.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just like, and the people that
they were selling it to, honestly,
[SPEAKER_13]: let's be honest, they were fairly large
commercial growers growing throughout the
[SPEAKER_13]: state.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they they basically right at that
transition point said, no, you don't have
[SPEAKER_13]: to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, the big thing of the pesticide
issue, that was like obvious.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, why do people do that?
[SPEAKER_13]: But the fact that there's still
Pachybutazole that's testing hot showed
[SPEAKER_13]: that this this whole mentality and this
whole market hasn't stopped.
[SPEAKER_13]: It only blew up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It only got bigger.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: And and and to me, that's the state not
looking at cannabis like a crop,
[SPEAKER_13]: not thinking about, I mean, the way they
regulated the the the canopy, the way they
[SPEAKER_13]: regulated who got licenses, all of it,
they're not thinking about it the same way
[SPEAKER_13]: they think about all the other crops,
which is it's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to protect the farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to maintain a certain,
you know, status quo in terms of yield and
[SPEAKER_13]: what the price per whatever is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And anyway, that that to me is a big part
of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And California now is trying to kind of
like backpedal and figure out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but so it's overregulated.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that it's it's not regulated like
another crop.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that it's not really like tobacco
or alcohol.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So to me, it's just a big dropping of the
ball.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like no one really would thought about
what it was regulated like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, don't they grow tobacco with radium
226?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the point there is that I make is that
if we imagine prohibition never happened,
[SPEAKER_13]: what would it be?
[SPEAKER_13]: What would the market look like?
[SPEAKER_13]: We all want to be a cleaner, safer,
better.
[SPEAKER_13]: World.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we also want cannabis to be treated
like other plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's that to me is a big part of
this intersection with how do we
[SPEAKER_13]: transition?
[SPEAKER_13]: It applies to hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: It applies to the THC market.
[SPEAKER_13]: It applies to how we apply pesticides.
[SPEAKER_13]: It applies to so many different aspects
that shop that the way we test and sell by
[SPEAKER_13]: THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like we need to get to the point
where from a higher level, we understand
[SPEAKER_13]: that this is a cash commodity.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to protect the farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to protect all of those things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the same time, it's nuanced because
cannabis is incredibly complicated and
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a lot of weird kids there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, well, and it's a it's a
it's become a cash commodity, but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: also a sacred plant sacrament.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I don't think it's about stooping
to the low of agriculture, which is
[SPEAKER_07]: captured and all but poisoned and led to
all the long term chronic illness and
[SPEAKER_07]: cancer that now we're faced with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's cannabis is here.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the big great gifts it's here to
offer beyond the phytochemical complex of
[SPEAKER_07]: what it brings is through the testing that
we've never applied to any other crop on
[SPEAKER_07]: this level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it being this great bio accumulator of
the century, it's helping to uproot the
[SPEAKER_07]: story and the legacy of the Green
Revolution and what we've done,
[SPEAKER_07]: the land, what we've done to the
neighborhoods, what we've done to the
[SPEAKER_07]: school districts downwind of the drifting
fucking avocado farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and so for what it's worth,
like, you know, I think kind of when there
[SPEAKER_07]: is integrity testing, I think that creates
the barrier of entry that keeps out big
[SPEAKER_07]: ag, big tobacco, big pharma.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can't just flip a thousand
acre monocrop mega farm that sprayed
[SPEAKER_07]: glyphosate and all the organophosphates
from World War Two that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you could grow, grow rope for 10 years,
maybe clean up your land.
[SPEAKER_07]: One day you can grow some type one,
type two, type three drug cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: But until then, go grow rope, you know,
because the thing is, is like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, cannabis, I mean, because
there's the potency thing and then there's
[SPEAKER_07]: the public health and safety thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The potency thing is a marketing bullshit
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You blow out 80 percent of the
cannabinoids and turf in the smoke,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, whenever you exhale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody holds it in their lungs like they
used to when we were growing up,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because it was so cherished and,
you know, rare or, you know, scarce.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people are sipping and ripping,
just taking a little puff, blowing it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of everything goes out in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's the labeling, pure
labeling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And or pure pure marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and deducing it down to THC is kind of
really blurred the lines between the most
[SPEAKER_07]: monocrop biomass and the most craft
champagne, quite tall quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: there is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then labs just passing everything is
clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's blurred lines between the dirtiest,
most ag adjacent herb and the cleanest,
[SPEAKER_07]: most like, you know, kind of complete,
you know, non compromised herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think the testing has a huge
role, you know, to kind of help to kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: create that division between what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, when it comes to,
you know, the whole reality of the
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides, you know, I think it's because
there's a lot of national efforts on the
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp lobby with a lot of big money people
trying to, you know, further turn this
[SPEAKER_07]: into a commodity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, because, you know, that's I
think it's this plants a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But but the thing is, is I think we have
to be eternally vigilant to prevent this
[SPEAKER_07]: from ever happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we allow the stripping of the
regulations and reduction to be more like
[SPEAKER_07]: food than you know, everybody lost,
nobody ever had a chance.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody that's been doing this all their
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, is where cannabis is
planted, it's kind of like a transparency
[SPEAKER_07]: beacon.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so in Santa Barbara County,
where all the avocados and all in
[SPEAKER_07]: Camarillo, all the I mean, rotational ag,
you know, rotational crop planted
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout the year, different times
sprayed with different pesticides and
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides and things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a constant moving target.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when a cannabis farm is planted
there, boom, bang, you failed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that there's recourse because like
farmers carrying crop insurance,
[SPEAKER_07]: crop insurance claims are skyrocketing in
California right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, farmers are getting sued because
their their drift is affecting a
[SPEAKER_07]: neighboring cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a high value crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now their crop insurance skyrockets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now kind of liability is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's all these pesticide use
report request investigations leading to
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of crop insurance claims.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what's happening is it's forcing
reform in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aerial spraying out of helicopters and and
planes in Santa Barbara County has
[SPEAKER_07]: decreased by 80 percent in the last few
years because cannabis is now in the
[SPEAKER_07]: neighborhood.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then not only does that clean up
and prevent kind of cannabis farms from
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of just having this constant failing
situation that they can't do anything
[SPEAKER_07]: about, but it's also it's lowering the
overall exposure of school districts and
[SPEAKER_07]: the watersheds and streams.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, because people spraying in
the middle of the day without any like
[SPEAKER_07]: consideration of FIFRA and wind conditions
and like time of day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are just spraying out of,
you know, economic convenience right out
[SPEAKER_07]: of helicopters and just dive bombing when
people are just driving down the freeway
[SPEAKER_07]: next to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think kind of it's really
incredible to see what's happening in this
[SPEAKER_07]: way of the forced reform that's happening
in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to pull on that thread a little
bit, Alec.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what would really help the
industry and put it above this whole ag
[SPEAKER_08]: market, which is fairly non-transparent,
is if we can get the states to put their
[SPEAKER_08]: testing data from metric public.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now we have to FOIA this stuff from
a lot of the states, which is a big pain
[SPEAKER_08]: in the ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hats off to Yasha Khan and Jeff Ross
and a lot of people have gone and done
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim McRae also did a lot of this early on
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you guys see this screen that I put
up?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we've done is we've gotten data,
FOIA data supplied by Yasha and others,
[SPEAKER_08]: whoever has it, and put it into a SQL
database so that we can look at.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, we're not doing THC,
although we have that data.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do that next.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been looking at just microbial
failure rates.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we can chart the fail rate per lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this gives us all types of information
in regards to which labs are over or under
[SPEAKER_08]: failing things.
[SPEAKER_08]: But more importantly, you can also see
some strange behavior in certain labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can actually chart, let's say,
let's take this lab I happen to know,
[SPEAKER_08]: very, very well-respected lab in mass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is their total yeast and mold
levels across time for every test in mass.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been going on for several years.
[SPEAKER_08]: As many know, the actual limit in mass is
10,000 CFUs per gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is red line here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have an even distribution of past
fails, samples above and beyond in terms
[SPEAKER_08]: of CFUs per gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their data is thinning out over time
because they're honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are leaving this lab because this
lab is in the state.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's shocking.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been going on since 2022,
and the CCC has done nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Except when labs raise this, the labs that
raise the fact that this is fake data or
[SPEAKER_08]: at least severely conflicted data,
they got visited by it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They call it rated, inspected by the CCC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the whistleblowers got attacked.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this particular lab we know is
operating in 10 states at least.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're vacuuming up the volume in all
the states.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those who are not familiar with
this, somehow the yeast and mold know to
[SPEAKER_08]: stop growing at 10,000 in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you go to other states where it's
at 100,000, labs are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got the memo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the yeast and mold got the memo.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the other benefit of this is that this
is Massachusetts data.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what could be really helpful in this
arena for a lot of these regulars,
[SPEAKER_08]: because they have their own tranches of
data, which they're drowning in.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they don't know how they compare to
other states.
[SPEAKER_08]: This would have really helped Oregon,
because Oregon blew out astrogillus
[SPEAKER_08]: testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a few labs there, this is not
apparent at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So not anyone's fault.
[SPEAKER_08]: But growers were getting screwed in that
some labs had 100% fail rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a couple labs had the same fail rate
as, sorry, I'm just taking a little bit of
[SPEAKER_08]: time to load.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take it off log scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other labs had a fail rate that was,
I can find the right labs here,
[SPEAKER_08]: that was in line with Michigan and Nevada.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I in astrogillus?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, I might need to be fooled.
[SPEAKER_08]: And got to find the right, oh,
sorry, I'm in the wrong graph.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you look at this, there's some labs
here that are giving like a 4% fail rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we see in Michigan and Nevada.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should have been any alarm bells.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you look at some of the lower
volume labs, you move this minimum test
[SPEAKER_08]: down, more labs should show up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these labs are failing everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had very few sample volume to do
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of them were under 100 tests.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this created a panic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the growers sued and got the regs
removed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now there's no astrogillus testing in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, obviously I'm conflicted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So cry me a river, or sorry, Oregon,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the states had the capacity to
measure state to state, the regulators
[SPEAKER_08]: would know, no, wait a minute,
we're dealing with an anomaly here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of labs that are out of
spec, but the largest volume lab in the
[SPEAKER_08]: state was in line with Michigan and
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we know where to focus.
[SPEAKER_08]: But instead they kind of folded not being
able to handle the onslaught that was
[SPEAKER_08]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the growers rightfully were like,
shit, we're gonna all go out of business
[SPEAKER_08]: if they were testing in any of these labs
that had 100%, you know, really high fail
[SPEAKER_08]: rates.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can do this with pesticides as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a host of ways to kind of parse
the data.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think getting this public so that a
lot of people in the field can attack the
[SPEAKER_08]: data, help the regulators.
[SPEAKER_08]: The regulators don't have anyone on staff
to do this type of data analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's always better to have more eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, there are labs that are
vested in understanding this data.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are consumers that are vested.
[SPEAKER_08]: But very rarely do the labs or the
consumers have the lobbying power to go
[SPEAKER_08]: and change the regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: The growers have a lot of money and a lot
of tax receipts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so be it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the market, if you look at the lab
markets, like 400 million a year is what
[SPEAKER_08]: has been estimated at.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas the grow market is, the whole
cannabis industry is north of 20 billion.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the regulations are gonna get written
by the people with the most tax money
[SPEAKER_08]: going into the state coffers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they'll continue to probably do
what tobacco did, which is to rip out all
[SPEAKER_08]: the regulations possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And while the consumers and the labs kind
of sit on this different economic
[SPEAKER_08]: chessboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the same thing can probably be done
with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some pesticide data in here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see the pesticide data in Oregon
didn't radically change during the
[SPEAKER_08]: timeframe of putting in any of that
Aspergillus test.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I think that's my soap box is that
I think if we get this data public,
[SPEAKER_08]: we can help the regulators police the
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like what happened in Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like, because whenever the public
kind of was able to do the Freedom of
[SPEAKER_07]: Information Act request and look at the
data, it was kind of pretty transparent
[SPEAKER_07]: with labs were never failing anybody and
deviating from actually the average.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Kevin, and this is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to talk with you at length about
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actively in like multiple,
pretty large Aspergillus contamination
[SPEAKER_07]: root cause analysis, which I, you know,
because really early on when legalization
[SPEAKER_07]: happens, you know, fail started popping up
a fail is consequential, you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: remediate or destroy product, thousands,
tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of
[SPEAKER_07]: thousand dollars product, or really early
at SC labs, we learned like, you can't
[SPEAKER_07]: just auto email somebody in a fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the end of the relationship,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so so and that and, you know,
and a lot of labs that opened kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: within a year of legalization that thought
it was just a get rich quick guaranteed
[SPEAKER_07]: testing kind of thing, because it's
mandatory, mandatory, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: they like were compromised from the very
beginning, because it's like a fail means
[SPEAKER_07]: the loss of the business, you know,
and so a lot of labs that had no
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding of the plant, no kind of
experience, no ability to even engage with
[SPEAKER_07]: clients to help them figure it out,
you know, just it's easier to pass people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they people would just pass people and,
and that's, again, where this disincentive
[SPEAKER_07]: occurred with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we almost went out of
business towards the end of last year,
[SPEAKER_07]: because nobody even wanted to work with us
because of how fraudulent the testing
[SPEAKER_07]: space was.
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the topic of Aspergillus,
you know, it's, it's really fascinating,
[SPEAKER_07]: because, you know, what we see,
it's about about two and a half,
[SPEAKER_07]: 3% fail rate across all testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So most people don't fail most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But whenever somebody has legitimate
spores detected and present, that's an
[SPEAKER_07]: indication that spores are present
somewhere in your facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unless they're attended to
methodically, to like eradicate them from
[SPEAKER_07]: a facility, then what you can see is like
this over time, you know, intermittent
[SPEAKER_07]: fail rate from like one out of 40 batches
to one out of 20 batches to one out of 10
[SPEAKER_07]: batches.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you start seeing this like exponential
increase in fail rates to where like worst
[SPEAKER_07]: case scenario examples, you know,
we've had groups have a 50 to 60% fail
[SPEAKER_07]: rate for fumigatus or flavus on any sample
they sent in, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what happens whenever an issued
a rises with Aspergillus that is not even
[SPEAKER_07]: addressed, right, or like somebody works
with a lab to just give them clean results
[SPEAKER_07]: and brush it under the rug.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't mean it goes away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this kind of really, I think in a big
way, kind of correlates that Oregon
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation as well, because Oregon
didn't do any micro testing for six,
[SPEAKER_07]: seven plus years of legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of a sudden now like Aspergillus
kicks in, all of a sudden, fail rates are
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of way higher than people think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, there's probably a bunch on
contaminated labs, not having your shit
[SPEAKER_07]: together, not having the, you know,
positive negative trolls, all the things
[SPEAKER_07]: in place to ensure that they're producing
quality data.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not I wouldn't be surprised if
certain groups actually legitimately had a
[SPEAKER_07]: really high fail rate, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what happens what we've seen is,
you know, predatory, like, so,
[SPEAKER_07]: so these pieces of Aspergillus,
they're not native to cannabis microbiome,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're placed there through some type of
a vector source, those vector sources can
[SPEAKER_07]: be something like, like contaminated
trichoderma, who would have ever thought
[SPEAKER_07]: that, right, people are buying from arbor
core organics, certain products,
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't name where they're inoculating,
you got like beneficial fungus,
[SPEAKER_07]: trichoderma, inoculated on like a green
clay, that turns out the green clay is
[SPEAKER_07]: contaminated with Aspergillus fumigatus,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're buying thousands of dollars of
beneficial fungus, inadvertently
[SPEAKER_07]: inoculating human pathogenic fungus all
over your entire crop, watering it into
[SPEAKER_07]: the root zones, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: People are taking predatory bug sources,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That are on a media, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: vermiculite mix, a vermiculite brand mix,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're spreading it over the root
balls of their plants to deploy the bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess what, that's a vector,
like we've seen, like, a couple of the
[SPEAKER_07]: biggest cases, like an ongoing one we're
working with right now, we just kind of,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and because that's what's crazy,
it's like, we were never the lab that was
[SPEAKER_07]: going to just stroke somebody's ego,
like, tell them everything is okay,
[SPEAKER_07]: and just fraudulently, like, let them get
passes, we fail, if it fails, we fail
[SPEAKER_07]: them, and then somebody like myself,
and now we have a technical services team
[SPEAKER_07]: to engage immediately as a fail happens to
both demonstrate the quality and
[SPEAKER_07]: reproducibility of our work, and how
seriously we take a fail, and all the LQC
[SPEAKER_07]: checks that we have in place to ensure the
quality of the batch and the data,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then from there disarming,
because everybody wants to put it on the
[SPEAKER_07]: lab, like lab screwed up, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But then after we do this process of
demonstrating quality and precision of our
[SPEAKER_07]: work, then we shift into a root cause
analysis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And over hundreds of these root cause
analyses, we've gotten to the exact who,
[SPEAKER_07]: what, where, why, when, how, and a
contaminant might have entered the supply
[SPEAKER_07]: chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've been able to, you know,
turn it because originally, it was like
[SPEAKER_07]: total shit sandwiches, you know,
just engaging with groups worse than
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation I've ever had with an owner
screaming at me, you know, kind of button,
[SPEAKER_07]: but now it's like, you know, we've
developed a palette for these shit
[SPEAKER_07]: sandwiches, because we've had we have so
many example use cases, root cause cases
[SPEAKER_07]: where we figured this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now it's like, within a few
questions, we can actually help somebody
[SPEAKER_07]: genuinely figure out what's coming from,
because what happens is, there's a vector
[SPEAKER_07]: that introduces it, once it's introduced,
then if you you know, say you say you
[SPEAKER_07]: introduce it through predatory bug source
or introduce it through inoculating greed,
[SPEAKER_07]: we've seen certain instances of like,
like, there's pinstripe, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's like a cocoa fiber, peat moss,
perlite, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen like, instances, you know,
so they can be batch to batch,
[SPEAKER_07]: like media issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but whenever we see the widespread
outbreaks and contamination, it's usually
[SPEAKER_07]: we're seeing it from, like something like
taking trichoderma, putting it in your
[SPEAKER_07]: reservoir, watering it into every single
plant in your room, right into the root
[SPEAKER_07]: zone, and then it like proliferates and
it's spores will like linger.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you heart what happens is you
harvest the room, you go bring it into a
[SPEAKER_07]: dry room, you hang all the material in
this huge, big dense kind of smashed
[SPEAKER_07]: together area, you know, where humidity
spikes, you got dehumidifiers working to
[SPEAKER_07]: pull out the humidity, you have tons of
airflow circulating the air around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what happens is you have the
proliferation of the spores that then
[SPEAKER_07]: spread in the air systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so so the the amplification
multiplication factor for the fail rates
[SPEAKER_07]: happen in the air systems, you know,
the HVAC lines, the air ducts,
[SPEAKER_07]: the air handlers, the dehumidifier
filters, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we go out and do swabbing,
you know, it's like those spaces
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically, that yield the most positive
results of detection, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so so whenever we do these types of
analysis, root cause analysis,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's about engaging to help identify the
root, chase it out of the facility,
[SPEAKER_07]: like remove that source from ever being
introduced, and then simultaneously
[SPEAKER_07]: leveling up microbial reduction strategies
for how somebody is approaching air system
[SPEAKER_07]: decontamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because most farmers they that don't fail
most of the time, you know, they have some
[SPEAKER_07]: semi, you know, solid process of surface
sanitation and spraying walls and cleaning
[SPEAKER_07]: trays, but very few farmers ever use some
type of chlorine dioxide or other type of
[SPEAKER_07]: gas type of solution where they actually
intentionally target air systems,
[SPEAKER_07]: because air systems are the biggest place
where we see the spore counts kind of grow
[SPEAKER_07]: rise, and then carry over to the next
batch into the next batch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all of a sudden, it's an
amplification issue that that's where we
[SPEAKER_07]: see the fail rates go from like,
you know, 2% up to 15, 30, 40 plus percent
[SPEAKER_07]: within a facility, but whenever but it's a
very contained within a specific facility
[SPEAKER_07]: issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people don't fail most of the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, once it's present, if you don't
like very methodically like address the
[SPEAKER_07]: issue, it can become like you got to like
burn your facility down kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So HVAC gets a garden clean, you know,
compared to or a lot cheaper than the rad
[SPEAKER_13]: source machine that you use to neutralize
your weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, last week, we we kind of brushed
over like, for maybe a two minutes
[SPEAKER_09]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we're talking about
aspergillus a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we've talked a lot about
the data, we talked a lot about what we
[SPEAKER_09]: see wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what we see a lot in a lot of
new markets is just it goes straight to
[SPEAKER_09]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that goes to a jar.
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then someone's like, someone's buying
that being like, yeah, I just bought a
[SPEAKER_09]: black cherry or just bought powdered
donuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they go home and they're smoking
remediated herb that is just laden with
[SPEAKER_09]: dead cells.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, how healthy is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and what what are we doing in
the in the industry or the community to to
[SPEAKER_09]: bring awareness?
[SPEAKER_08]: Has a good paper on this looking at bio
aerosols.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, so if you zap your way out of this
problem, you end up with high mycotoxins
[SPEAKER_08]: and high endotoxins and a variety of other
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other stuff that are just not well
studied, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the paper I threw up here, speaking of
powdered donuts, this is a really good
[SPEAKER_08]: paper from Zamir Punja, where he's noticed
that the total yeast and mold levels in
[SPEAKER_08]: his plants are very genotype specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got some that are 50 fold less T.Y.M.
[SPEAKER_08]: than others consistently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Powder donuts being one of the worst ones,
because maybe that powder isn't the powder
[SPEAKER_08]: you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exactly I think that's the what I you
know, the thing I think about a lot is you
[SPEAKER_09]: know, we all talk about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're coming in for wellness and we're
leaving with what, you know, another
[SPEAKER_09]: problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we are doing our best as as
community members and constituents and
[SPEAKER_09]: and, you know, just good, good practices
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the end, you're getting tested
for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not calling out the specific
strain of of what this is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's really no it's just a blanket
pass fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: And is that the right way, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mark, you know, do you feel,
you know, Alec, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: you've been going deeper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a way for us to call out these
specific constituents that are problematic
[SPEAKER_09]: versus the ones that are perhaps benign?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you find me real quick, so go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: You first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, just real quick, you know,
like because.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although California's triple fucked up in
all kinds of ways, you know, around kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of how this whole system is rolled out,
you know, one thing I think that they did
[SPEAKER_07]: really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and, you know, we actually were a big
lobby part with a lot of the organic
[SPEAKER_07]: farmers in California to kind of block the
implementation of total use of mold,
[SPEAKER_07]: total aerobic bacteria levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, what we've seen from
states that have implemented these
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly restrictive use of mold count
levels and bacteria levels, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that's the biggest fail rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 30, 40, 50 percent failure rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It forces people into having to kill step
to having to, you know, overzone it or
[SPEAKER_07]: pasteurize or gamma radiate everything
before it's even sold retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that in a big way, in my opinion,
that kind of dooms a legal market because
[SPEAKER_07]: then everything is terps apps prior to
being sold.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then you're guaranteed to be able to
find any everything terpier and fresher
[SPEAKER_07]: and more aromatic and turpanic from the
black market or traditional market than
[SPEAKER_07]: you are from anything on a dispensary
shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and and in those states,
people are full Tyvex like like clean suit
[SPEAKER_07]: like it's gnarly, you know, obviously
anybody that's operating those spaces.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like and you know, the thing is,
is kind of as an agricultural crop,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're going to regulate so strictly on
EPA regulated like anti-life chemicals
[SPEAKER_07]: from Bayer and DuPont, Syngenta and all
these chemical companies, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like the way is like organic IPM
practices using beneficial microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_07]: compost teas, kind of like other ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's basically a de facto ban on
all on all biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing is, there are no EPA
approved pesticides for use on cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: and all the state regulatory bodies that
have tried to make select lists.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll see like most of the biopesticides
on there, you know, low, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: efficacy, high use rate kind of materials.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the onus is on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what is a pesticide?
[SPEAKER_12]: Pesticides are active ingredient that
kills bugs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sold in different product
formulations and places like Lowe's and
[SPEAKER_12]: Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, the onus is on the company that
registers.
[SPEAKER_12]: So those products are regulated under the
Environmental Protection Agency,
[SPEAKER_12]: not the U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_12]: The EPA grants licenses for use on
pesticides and nothing is registered for
[SPEAKER_12]: use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, they do have some stuff registered on
hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I thought is interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I think they're caught in that
whole differentiation based on cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_12]: profile.
[SPEAKER_12]: But until the company shows that owns the
registration for the active ingredient
[SPEAKER_12]: shows that at commercial application use
rates that there's no effect to the
[SPEAKER_12]: environment, no effect to the crop in
terms of toxicity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, for that, they'd have to
basically enroll human subjects,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is going to take years and millions
of dollars to show that we could apply
[SPEAKER_12]: this pesticide to cannabis during this
stage of production at this use rate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And here are the metabolites.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've done safety assessments on the
levels of metabolites that are in the
[SPEAKER_12]: final cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_12]: They're they're safe.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we've done clinic, basically clinical
studies in humans to show that you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: when they apply a typical insecticide or
fungicide to a crop, first of all,
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of those crops, all most of those
crops aren't smoked.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of those crops are washed and a
lot of those crops.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really love your comment here,
Alex, because growing indoors,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, a lot of these pesticides are
basically photolytically labile.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're meant to basically elicit their
mode of action and in a photolytically
[SPEAKER_12]: degraded within days.
[SPEAKER_07]: With UVA, BNC spectrum, which isn't there
in indoor either.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somehow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you may not be getting that light in
your indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the other thing you said, which is
really, you know, again, disturbing to
[SPEAKER_12]: hear is that these things are
environmentally persistent in indoor
[SPEAKER_12]: cavities.
[SPEAKER_12]: And especially when you have things like
drywall, which, you know, is great for
[SPEAKER_12]: hanging pictures on your wall,
but not the thing you want to clad the
[SPEAKER_12]: inside of your cannabis production
facility with.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's certainly better cladding options.
[SPEAKER_12]: But maybe, Kevin, I guess the interesting
aspect I saw in your data is, yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: again, that bifurcation where it's like,
OK, now everything's all of a sudden below
[SPEAKER_12]: and those labs are getting the business.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know that, again, in testing labs,
it's all about the numbers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, Alec, it's all about how many how
many test samples can you get out?
[SPEAKER_12]: How many customers can you keep?
[SPEAKER_12]: So the samples that you're testing this
week, are people going to get those
[SPEAKER_12]: results and be like, oh, fuck,
we're not going to go to SC anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to go to some other place
that's going to give us better results.
[SPEAKER_12]: So maintaining customers, I mean,
it's an incredible challenge.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I remember when looking at pro forma
as the testing labs, you think,
[SPEAKER_12]: oh, yeah, these companies probably worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, fuck, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like they're operating at a razor
thin margin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where basically you're trying to you're
trying to beat the other 10 testing labs
[SPEAKER_12]: in your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, there's incredible pressures
on these labs to produce and to try to,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, create bottom line impacts.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a it's a tough place to be,
man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark, that's where the marketing is a
problem, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like it's just there's no there's
nearly there's no factual evidence behind
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of the marketing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just all it's all the highest point.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they go out and shop that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it creates that competition because
they have a mandate as a business.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're trying to hit a product at 92
percent every single time with eight
[SPEAKER_09]: percent turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it tastes good and hits the high 90s.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you'll shop that all day long if
you can make make one printed design and
[SPEAKER_09]: send it around to 200 shops like it just
saves you money across the board.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to finish the point I was
trying to make real quick, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: just about kind of like what Kevin was
talking about with the Oregon stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because in California and how
California did testing, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like very happy that they didn't they
focused specifically on the human
[SPEAKER_07]: pathogenic organisms.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is a really important
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this could evolve.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's like I think they took a more
sophisticated approach, not regulating
[SPEAKER_07]: just the benign arbitrary colonies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Total yeast and mold, totally aerobic
bacteria focused more on the human
[SPEAKER_07]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot more micro toxin
producing type of compound.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The type of fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I think that's the evolution of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But but the fact is, I think it was a
great success that specific aspergillus
[SPEAKER_07]: species that are human pathogenic
organisms were what are targeted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a presence or absence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any any DNA detected in, you know,
one gram of material.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like a quantification how much
is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just presence or absence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't really ever failed anybody for
micro toxins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like peanuts or coffee beans
where it's like widespread outbreak
[SPEAKER_07]: producing micro toxins.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's more intermittently spread.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Particularly compounded through air
systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's one of the big things that I
want to make point of is like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like focusing specifically on
public health and safety and what can harm
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is what I think the way forward is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to end up in court.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Eventually it's going to end up in court.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the clinical literature is not written
in the language of eleven thousand total
[SPEAKER_08]: yeast and mold colonies hurt somebody.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just don't write papers that way
because they're forced to basically
[SPEAKER_08]: satisfy Koch's postulates, which is you
isolate the pathogenic organism and you
[SPEAKER_08]: reintroduce it to a model organism and see
that it creates harm.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you haven't created that loop,
you can't publish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the clinical literature is not going
to let you publish something saying I had
[SPEAKER_08]: fifty six thousand total aerobic count in
maybe that hurts somebody.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to say, no, go back and tell
us if it was E.
[SPEAKER_08]: coli, if it was salmonella, if it was
staff, if it was pseudomonas, like you
[SPEAKER_08]: have to isolate the organism.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the clinical literature is written
in species specific language.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's say it grows like happens in
Oregon and they were to go to court.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would probably lose against
aspergillus because there's, in fact,
[SPEAKER_08]: clinical literature tying harm to real
patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they applied that case against total
use and mold, they would win because the
[SPEAKER_08]: reality cannot defend.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do not know which level was harmful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's meant to be just a bio burden
check.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not meant to actually predict
outcomes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the reality of aspergillus,
though, in Oregon, right, because all
[SPEAKER_07]: because in Oregon, you got all the heady
organic people, you know, deploying
[SPEAKER_07]: organic IPM practices, spreading predatory
bugs, deploying trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't surprise me if a pretty high
fail rate existed individually within
[SPEAKER_07]: certain facilities because of how much
we've seen the introduction of it leads
[SPEAKER_07]: to, you know, because most people,
again, don't fail most of the time for
[SPEAKER_07]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_07]: But once you've introduced it and spores
are genuinely present in your facility and
[SPEAKER_07]: you're in a closed loop system and it
compounds and carries over and like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, kind of replicates in the air
systems, you start compounding the issue
[SPEAKER_07]: to where you have no idea how big and how
gnarly of an issue it can become.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's one of the things where I
think like, you know, Oregon, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't have any microbiology testing in
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: They started like by leading the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they didn't do this thing with
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they fought it and, you know,
prevented it from coming in.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't mean the problem doesn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and so I think the reality is,
is, you know, kind of a more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_07]: approach and how kind of it's dealt with
and how it's understood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, a lot of
well-intentioned organic farmers that are
[SPEAKER_07]: using organic IPM products inadvertently,
unknowingly are introducing it and then
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of might very well have 30,
40 plus percent fail rates internally
[SPEAKER_07]: because they've never
[SPEAKER_07]: done it before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think it's a, it's definitely a
big issue, you know, and, and I think kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of, too, a lot of the work you've done,
Kevin, it's like, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there, there are things besides,
you know, kind of aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there are certain other types of
things that could be producing things that
[SPEAKER_07]: are gnarly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think instead of kind of just test,
you know, that's why I appreciated
[SPEAKER_07]: California.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't, it's, it wasn't just testing
all microbes for the sake of testing
[SPEAKER_07]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was focusing on the human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think as long as we do that,
you know, we can kind of actually as a
[SPEAKER_07]: whole community help kind of, you know,
really advance the plant and the safety
[SPEAKER_08]: and efficacy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other side of the aspergillus testing
has been that people are complaining that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's, there's visible mold on some
cannabis that gets through that
[SPEAKER_08]: aspergillus, it's not aspergillus,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and somehow we probably have to
button that up with figuring out what that
[SPEAKER_08]: is and, and, and either have a visual
screen or we're finding what other
[SPEAKER_08]: pathogenic organisms were cared about.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not pathogenic, we should,
you know, throw it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can see it like a strawberry,
but if it's pathogenic, maybe,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe we got to keep, maybe you got to add
something to the list, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what the filter for material
test is supposed to pick up by the lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's I think the species specific
stuff will also reduce a lot of the lab
[SPEAKER_08]: shopping because the fail rates go down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So people don't have a motivation to lab
shop as much.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, on top of that,
the labs are, they're much easier tests to
[SPEAKER_08]: perform in that the lab to lab,
they won't be as discordant than the total
[SPEAKER_08]: use of mold tests.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you probably have less of this
capacity for people to find the lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's got a 2% failure rate versus a 15%
failure rates.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, everyone's going to probably be
floating around three to 5%, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: the independent of which, which test
provider they're using.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll probably wipe out the motivation
for folks to be lab shopping off of
[SPEAKER_08]: microbials.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we get those things done right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I, um, can I mention something else
about, I'm not sure if we want to talk
[SPEAKER_13]: about this today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate, I always got to defend Wade.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get in there, Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're muted, Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, patient of many years, cultivator of
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this conversation this morning
has really been focused around solving
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that come with indoor cultivation
and or extensive greenhouse cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could be naive and I would ask,
anyone on the panel to call me out for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was a cultivator and engaged in
what we call regenerative practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was creating any of the inputs
that I wanted for my crop on my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew what was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all of these issues around
aspergillus, yes, it's in the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but it's a non-issue in a sun grown
regenerative garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my experience and again, totally open
to anyone on the, on the group calling me
[SPEAKER_00]: out as bullshit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to say that part of the siloing
that has happened in states across this
[SPEAKER_00]: country is forcing this conversation upon
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want to remind people that if
you grow your own in the sun, take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back to listening,
fascinating conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some data actually at hand that can
try to address this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for bringing it up,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so there, there is, uh, a lot of
discussion about aspergillus out there and
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to keep in mind that aspergillus
has got 280 different species and we only
[SPEAKER_08]: give a shit about four of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is, um, now I don't have this
split by outdoor and indoor, but it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: very important point, uh, that I'll have
to see if our, if we have that information
[SPEAKER_08]: and we can maybe dissect it and get to
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what you're seeing on these,
on these top lines up here that are kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of cratering to the right are all
aspergillus species and leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me back up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got about a thousand whole genome
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we do whole genome sequencing,
we get the microbiome picture with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we can then ask what tissue type
did the sequencing come from and,
[SPEAKER_08]: and look at the microbiome per tissue
type.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you look at, uh, when you're
looking on the, on the X axis here are the
[SPEAKER_08]: number of reads per million.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you're sequencing the fungal
microbiome, we're just counting how many
[SPEAKER_08]: reads are aspergillus versus all other
fungal shit that's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and it's, it's there at, you can see a
hundred percent of the samples will have
[SPEAKER_08]: aspergillus of some sort at a hundred
reads per million.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still a very, very low amount,
but all, all of the samples that we
[SPEAKER_08]: collected, this is 943 samples,
uh, that are, that are in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, when you start going down to the
four that we care about in the
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations, this drops down to like the
9% range that have a hundred reads per
[SPEAKER_08]: million.
[SPEAKER_08]: We think the PCR tests are kind of picking
things up somewhere around the three or
[SPEAKER_08]: 400 reads per million range.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the numbers, this is, this kind of
lines up with the Alex number around three
[SPEAKER_08]: to 4% failure rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just want to show this because it's
often thrown out there that aspergillus is
[SPEAKER_08]: everywhere, which is true as a genus,
but as a species of these four pathogenic
[SPEAKER_08]: ones, there's a huge gap between all of
them and just these four.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the ubiquity stuff is, is, um,
you gotta keep in mind there's a major
[SPEAKER_08]: reduction when you just focus on,
on the two that are there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but we now have this kind of
information, um, from basically a thousand
[SPEAKER_08]: different, uh, cannabis genomes from all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we know like what pathogens are there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so we can better inform regulators
that, okay, these ones we don't need to
[SPEAKER_08]: care about these ones we do based on their
frequency of what we found from sequencing
[SPEAKER_08]: data.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause what they're really done is just
taken most of the food industry and just
[SPEAKER_08]: lobbed it on top of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they're putting Listeria in place.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never found Listeria.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't see Listeria in this type of
sequencing data, but they want to put it
[SPEAKER_08]: in there because the food people use it
and the food people have a test for,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they can slap that onto our field and
start, you know, harvesting, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: some food testing revenue from us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, arguably a colon cell,
they're very, very low in frequency.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they're, they're there and it's like
probably one in a thousand samples or
[SPEAKER_08]: something might be positive for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, maybe you do want to grab those
if it's going to end up in, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: in, you know, oral or end up ingested in
some way.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, I don't think anyone is lab
shopping off of E.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coli cell numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just the frequency of failure is
just too low for anyone to give a shit
[SPEAKER_08]: about, uh, that it wouldn't, it wouldn't
create that kind of economic motivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we've got to do, Wade,
is I got to see if we have that
[SPEAKER_08]: information in this database, if we can
split it by outdoor, indoor, because I do
[SPEAKER_08]: think what Alec is bringing up,
the indoor systems are recirculating a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: The spores are in the facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just recycling those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and outdoor systems may have all types
of natural mechanisms to keep Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_08]: at bay, like all these other gram positive
bacteria that flush it out of,
[SPEAKER_08]: out of, um, competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one thing I think is important to keep
in mind is how like with the data coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from a lot of the product that's in the
market is not what the test actually
[SPEAKER_02]: represents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of product that
just gets slapped a label on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, um, in every market where
people are just taking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: part of some other batch and making it a
part of a batch that has a different
[SPEAKER_02]: sample or test on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I think the problem is
probably a lot more widespread than even
[SPEAKER_02]: the data would show.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a lot of that going on,
especially nowadays because of the times
[SPEAKER_09]: that we're in, you know, making things go
further.
[SPEAKER_09]: Test results last longer, um, batching
large batches over time and testing them
[SPEAKER_09]: week after week or every bi-weekly is a
really expensive endeavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, so I think that's,
that's a good call out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've thought about that often.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that you bring that up because
it's, it's metric data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is, is just about as reliable as the
person that's inputting it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's definitely, it's definitely true
in the sense that, you know, it,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's not just like, and I saw this in
Jamaica a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just like bad evil people who are
like, Oh, I'm just going to put these
[SPEAKER_11]: chemicals in cause I'm nefarious.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you see these situations occur
where it's like, I will either feed my
[SPEAKER_11]: family or I won't feed my family.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's sort of this mentality where
you're, it's like the ultimate trial where
[SPEAKER_11]: you're like, okay, like, are you going to
have the high integrity and bankrupt your
[SPEAKER_11]: life?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are you going to get that a hundred
pounds sat, you know, fig lot figured out
[SPEAKER_11]: and tested and passed in any way,
shape or form that you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's a very good point,
uh, in what, uh, Fletch just said in the
[SPEAKER_11]: sense that, uh, it's just so easy to fall
victim to circumstance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I want to keep on the, uh,
on the conversation, but I also want to
[SPEAKER_11]: like, first of all, thank everyone from
Fletch.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see Etienne is in the room for the first
time on, on 5.0.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brian's back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alec has also showed up here, which has
been awesome, dude, listening to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great to have Mojave in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grandmaster LED Thomas is here,
Colin and Wade that Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, Kevin McKernan sharing,
sharing the data.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just a real interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to recognize and thank you all
for showing up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here with my homie Merlin.
[SPEAKER_11]: My other friend just rolled up Lincoln
who's kind of off camera, but he left the
[SPEAKER_11]: room.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll just thank everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's 255 people watching right now and
let's, uh, you know, keep this
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation going.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was going to say, I met at the mo
cup.
[SPEAKER_13]: I met someone who's a farmer in central
Valley and he grows in the state legal
[SPEAKER_13]: market at scale grows THC a farm bill
hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: At scale and also grows traditional legacy
at scale and plays all three paths.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just like, I'm like,
wow, the logistics of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, like, wow, that you clearly can
handle a lot, but think about how much,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, there's a lot of diversion in
the state, obviously, and everything goes
[SPEAKER_13]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it can, that's, and I am hearing that
in other States too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear in other States where people are
like, you know, I wouldn't buy from,
[SPEAKER_13]: from the state market, but their flower
socks.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm buying imported THC a flower,
and then I'm selling it on our shelf as
[SPEAKER_13]: Delta nine and getting new CEO COAs on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just like, man, it's just nuts,
you know, and there's a lot of that going
[SPEAKER_13]: on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and, and lab shopping is, is kind of
at the heart of all that because diversion
[SPEAKER_13]: and, you know, working with burner distros
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about having a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and it's a, it's a dirty supply
chain and it's now a national dirty supply
[SPEAKER_13]: chain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this whole 80 farms in one batch of
distillate those that distillate that go
[SPEAKER_13]: that went in those vape pens in LA.
[SPEAKER_13]: It also goes to products all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's there's, you know, Missouri just
had the big recall recently last week
[SPEAKER_13]: again, because they couldn't validate the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just validating what,
where it came from, not what's even in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so it's, it's nuts, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's totally, totally, totally nuts.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me it's because we never,
you know, it's a real big picture issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, like Alec, you know,
I mean, it's a sacred plant, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you need to bring, you need to
bring the spirit with it, but you also
[SPEAKER_13]: need to bring philosophers and
ethnobotanists and ag tech guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody gets to get, it's maybe a
comedian or two, you know, get in there
[SPEAKER_13]: and actually like really approach it from
a comprehensive kind of panel like
[SPEAKER_13]: approach.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is what we do, you know,
and, and anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the, you're striking a chord on the
TSTA flower thing for me, cause I've had
[SPEAKER_09]: several, I have like a partner in mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in another state and he was walked
into a shop and they had like just
[SPEAKER_09]: everything lined up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like every chili bean, it's sour.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had, you know, OG Kush, they had it
all just lined up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was like, what's the deal here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to me about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was like, this is legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, well, how is it legal?
[SPEAKER_09]: And he walked him through the process of
how he buys his pounds and what,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, gets it through.
[SPEAKER_09]: And puts it in the jar.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they basically have a bodega
style set up where they wait in front of
[SPEAKER_09]: you and sell it to you as if you're in a
dispo.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's the other aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those pounds, what maybe go for 200,
300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's to Dr. Mark's point on
the commodity side, there's, there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: huge influx of this and there's really no
one grabbing onto where any of it came
[SPEAKER_09]: from.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no COA on most of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it is, it's made up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a question kind of for everybody
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What percentage of the black market weed
that exists today is coming from legal
[SPEAKER_02]: farms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think in my estimation,
it's more than 80% of the black market
[SPEAKER_02]: weed is backdoored product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because now that everybody knows
that like the deal on bros, you can't put
[SPEAKER_02]: up an illegal a hundred lighter easily
anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows why you're installing air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a fucking power upgrade,
everything that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black market is small little guys,
mostly little hash guys and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a few, you know, greenhouse outdoor
growers and whatever, but the vast
[SPEAKER_02]: majority, especially when you're talking
about indoor flowers, all backdoored legal
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like the, the market is not even
close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the data isn't even close to what the
actual market looks like.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think there's also some,
you know, there's, there's the big C's as
[SPEAKER_09]: I call them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think everyone can fill in the
blanks is the rest of that word is that
[SPEAKER_09]: are really running the larger ones,
but yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fletch, like it's mainly smaller guys,
but it's coming to spawn out the back door
[SPEAKER_09]: because it's, it's gotta go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's where it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, and when you're talking,
uh, extracts and stuff, it's probably,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's even more than flower
probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sadly, sadly from kind of my
observation, you know, I think some,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of the dirtiest material that
wouldn't pass testing in California goes
[SPEAKER_07]: East, you know, and I think it happens in
a lot of States, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where they can't pass a state established
quality standard, it diverts wherever it
[SPEAKER_07]: has to go, you know, and, and,
um, and, you know, I think there's a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: there, you know, um, your cannabis is,
you know, couldn't Mojave, you were saying
[SPEAKER_07]: it's, uh, like the dirtiest, you know,
the supply chain kind of, I think,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's, it's exposing the,
the potential of how dirty the agriculture
[SPEAKER_07]: and landscape is, but it's, so it's,
it has the potential to be the dirtiest
[SPEAKER_07]: supply chain, but the regulations and the
testing requirements have established it
[SPEAKER_07]: to be cleaner than water and food in most
areas of the country, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: when there's actually integrity in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's something really
profound.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of farmers like really
pridefully kind of establishing
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves, you know, and branding around
how our cannabis is cleaner than your
[SPEAKER_07]: food.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and, and I think that's a really
profound kind of, uh, think that the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: is here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're also bringing in kind of exposing
the, you know, contradictions in our lives
[SPEAKER_07]: of what we put in or on our body,
you know, but yet we smoke cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: cleaner than food and water, you know,
and, and so I think kind of, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the, um, you know, it was
interesting because when, when,
[SPEAKER_07]: before I, we opened up SC labs in,
uh, in 2007 is to nine, I was working at a
[SPEAKER_07]: store and, and, and I, I saw that there
were two types of people that were serving
[SPEAKER_07]: this plant, you know, kind of through the
lens of this whole conversation around
[SPEAKER_07]: IPM, you know, and people would come in
like week five or six of flower,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, web spider mites, millions of
spider mites kind of just go, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: going Richter and they're coming in a
super panic moment because they're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do the proper prevention game,
you know, to prevent this from being a
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I now have this really big problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and uh, it's like, always like,
dude, you don't, you can't really do
[SPEAKER_07]: anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's this like vacuum,
you know, it takes some slights brawners
[SPEAKER_07]: and like, like sponges, you know,
like strip every leaf off the plant that
[SPEAKER_07]: is family for anything kind of that you
can do to kind of remove as much of the
[SPEAKER_07]: physical kind of material or eggs and such
are, you got a lot of work ahead of you
[SPEAKER_07]: get after it, you know, and you can't even
really spray things like organic oils,
[SPEAKER_07]: cause those are also going to be
concentrating into your material,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, um, and, and, and so,
so it's like, there's this very integrity
[SPEAKER_07]: way of like not compromising the sacred
integrity and spirit of the spirit of this
[SPEAKER_07]: plant and the healing it is to offer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, there was this other
approach, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This other approach is like, well,
cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so there were people that were like,
all right, I'm going to go get to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is sounds like a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they would never even consider
compromising this plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that was going towards in so many ways,
compassion and how much it was helping
[SPEAKER_07]: heal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like this like act of like,
you know, general of charity and
[SPEAKER_07]: generosity that, you know, like those
serving would kind of like take seriously
[SPEAKER_07]: with their relationship with the plant,
you know, but then there's this other type
[SPEAKER_07]: of person that was in the pure pursuit of
profit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, dude, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me the, um, you know, give me the
vials with the little like two mil per
[SPEAKER_07]: gallon thing on the side, everyone you
got, you know, and they would take,
[SPEAKER_07]: they would just out of like their own
panic that they are now faced with kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: car op loss, they would kind of go above
and beyond the need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they would like take avid,
avamectin, fluoramide, biphenazate,
[SPEAKER_07]: Eagle 20, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Myclobutanol.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd do this like Trinity, like maybe
even a little forbid for F spinos or
[SPEAKER_07]: spheromethicin, you know, and they would
kind of mix them all together and they
[SPEAKER_07]: would spray that on their plant in week
five or six a flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like akin to like, I mean,
the reality of like, the act of poisoning,
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody that touches it from there on,
that's akin to like what's happening
[SPEAKER_07]: currently in agriculture with the
desiccation of all the grain crops with
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking Roundup, you know, and glyphosate
to spray, you know, a week before harvest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you mix all of it and any of those
might stay, you will have, those will be
[SPEAKER_09]: resistant to that application.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've seen it with Forbit too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen people, I've been called into
consult for several people over my time
[SPEAKER_09]: that have said they've done this crazy
cocktail, this number one mistake.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they went back in again with them
as individual constituents.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, balloons are popping up like
it's nuts because it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's insane that that is in their
mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's an ignorant, unmindful use of
these anti-life, petrochemical World War
[SPEAKER_07]: II nerve agent type, you know,
that's like without awareness,
[SPEAKER_07]: doing something that's actually really
like gnarly towards what the plants are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to wrap the point though,
I'm sorry, just to get back to what
[SPEAKER_07]: Archive was bringing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just wanted to kind of bring
this up because, you know, I think the
[SPEAKER_07]: reality is, see, it's like, you know,
cannabis is being reduced to this like
[SPEAKER_07]: commodity supply chain for pure pursuit of
profit capitalization that's being like
[SPEAKER_07]: expressed through all kinds of things
with, you know, the legal market
[SPEAKER_07]: intentionally diverting 80% of what's out
there to the traditional market,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Passing a contamination buck outward.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, it's happening kind of in many
different ways and flavors, but I think a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of it is kind of the dirty stuff
because, because the reality is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is what we've seen in California,
you know, it's like, if you look at prime
[SPEAKER_07]: ag land across the state and all the green
zones that agriculture practice,
[SPEAKER_07]: those are red zones for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those, those are the zones that are ag
adjacent and you're probably going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: having this ongoing kind of like issue
popping up, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but I think, but the, the point I
think I'm getting to there is like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like whenever I think,
you know, and I'm not saying that it's
[SPEAKER_07]: just because I'm part of a testing
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a culture anthropologist and
ethnobotanist and kind of my passion is
[SPEAKER_07]: people and plants and kind of just seeing
through the lens of testing, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: what this plant is doing and bringing to
the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think, I think those that are
in integrity with the spirit of the plant,
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, cause you know, like legalization
is just a stupid right structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people have been kind of in
services plant forever and you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: go, you know, the medicine has been going
where it needs to go and healing the
[SPEAKER_07]: world.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, is it, is it clean and in integrity
with the spirit of the plant or is it
[SPEAKER_07]: toxic, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like all the dirty ass cartridges like
that are, could never pass tests here
[SPEAKER_07]: going east.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where I think cartridges is the
worst topic on this idea of what is moving
[SPEAKER_07]: out of legal markets into the other spaces
and just also flooding that market,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, but it's with a hyper toxified
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, I think kind of testing
just, and then just our global perspective
[SPEAKER_07]: on what it brings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it brings a barrier of entry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it keeps the integrity and spirit
of the plant strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think those that are in integrity
with it, we're always going to find their
[SPEAKER_07]: way with the plant, you know, and,
and, and, and yeah, that was a very long
[SPEAKER_07]: winded thought, but you know, I think it's
the biggest issue and it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's, it's all, but it's also
the biggest competitive advantage,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's like those that,
you know, have operated by the code of
[SPEAKER_07]: conduct with this plant and work are solid
with their word and solid with how they
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivate and solid with like the
relations that, you know, that you have
[SPEAKER_07]: with people, you know, kind of in,
in, in growing together, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like, I think it's, you know,
I think a big thing of the LA times expose
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of my great prayers and hopes
around this is I feel like whenever the
[SPEAKER_07]: state of California is now on a hyper
alert about how big this is an issue and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's going to become just a steady,
it's a, it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's finally going to become fixed,
you know, and I think the real value of
[SPEAKER_07]: clean quality bomb material and extracts
is way undervalued because it's been
[SPEAKER_07]: driven to extinction and price with all
this dirtiest, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: most contaminated most bulk biomass,
you know, to where craft is explode or
[SPEAKER_07]: extinguished almost, you know,
but I think the reality is, is,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, people have been operating on
the idea that cannabis is a commodity
[SPEAKER_07]: crop, like, you know, just like price to
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but the reality is it's a scarce
resource.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the scarce resource,
you know, whenever there's actual testing
[SPEAKER_07]: and then transparency and integrity in the
system, that scarce resources,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what's going to like become.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can the DCC be successful in policing this
if the hemp market is outside of it,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like they've got to get an equal
footing on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to even talk anymore too,
but the reality too, I think Kevin,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's a, that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there, I think the definition of
industrial hemp is, is, is a curse on the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, you know, because nobody's growing
industrial hemp for fiber.
[SPEAKER_07]: 99% of people grow growing industrial hemp
or growing type three cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and, and without, uh,
with a completely separate world that it
[SPEAKER_07]: has to apply to or participate in,
you know, where it's just around this
[SPEAKER_07]: funny game around 0.3% as the definition,
you know, there there's, it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a game and it's, and, and,
and I think until there's a federal kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of re, uh, like a conversation around kind
of being rate cannabinoid, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: regulating type one, type two,
type three cannabis that's grown,
[SPEAKER_07]: grown for drug or medicine cultivation,
that's within the same zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actual industrial fiber for growing fiber
is, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't need that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's relaxed, you know, but,
but anyway, I just totally talked way too
[SPEAKER_07]: much.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'll kind of just, we'd love when
you talk too much.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why we, that's why we started
testing in the first place is because,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, growers were inherently untrustworthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There, I said it, you know, uh,
so, so many of them failed when we started
[SPEAKER_04]: testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, what did they do?
[SPEAKER_04]: They took it elsewhere and sold it because
nobody else was testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the market showed me early and often
07, 08, 09 that, you know, Alec,
[SPEAKER_04]: as much as I want to believe in the
kumbaya, a wonderful grower, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: fewer and far between.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately they still are from time
to time, you know, even people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: growing industrially realize they have
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's even better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we were talking, you know,
how blatant I writes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's just fascinating that the same
conundrums, the same problems,
[SPEAKER_04]: the same ethical issues that we were
discussing back then, such as how do we
[SPEAKER_04]: release this information?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what is tested on humans versus what
is still going on 15 years from now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are still being unethical with
their grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Mojave and I have been invited to go
check out the USDA's, um, germplasm,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they're doing some field days in New
York in September.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go check out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're grown over 500 different
varietals, uh, and they're also doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, density trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting to see,
uh, what they're doing because they've
[SPEAKER_04]: been collecting germplasm since,
um, 2021.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah, they're growing it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're growing it out at, uh,
six different, um, facilities around the U
[SPEAKER_04]: S but the majority is that, um,
they're growing up in upstate New York for
[SPEAKER_04]: their, uh, their own trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be interesting to see how
they handle it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually created and made their own
decoritator, uh, which is strictly per
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nothing large and industrial,
but it'll be interesting to see,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, what they're going to and towards,
um, because it's the same issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing is, is really changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've got these ethical growers
and now that we've become legal and you've
[SPEAKER_04]: got the industrial problems you've got,
as Wade was pointing out the indoor versus
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor versus the greenhouse,
which, um, was very interesting to see as
[SPEAKER_04]: we just saw with the Emerald Cup duel with
its test.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also saw the, uh, state fair in
California finally do a person's test as
[SPEAKER_04]: opposed to just relying on, you know,
laboratory testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's exciting the boundaries
are being pushed and we're expanding,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're still contracting around these
same issues and problems, especially with
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you know, industrialization and our
own little 10th amendment, little
[SPEAKER_04]: realities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, hi, I'm, I'm in Newfoundland
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm way off on the, uh, the East coast
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, hi and greetings everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to be back here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's an important just,
just point is that, and the reason that
[SPEAKER_13]: we're going to this USDA trial and the
reason that I'm folk, I've been focused on
[SPEAKER_13]: the ag side of cannabis a lot lately is
because I've said, I spent my whole life
[SPEAKER_13]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a sacred plant and it's my community
and literally my entire life, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been my entire journey with one
plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, but to me, that's about how we use
the plant, how our bodies, use the plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: the complex chemistry of the plant,
all the different uses from the plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: but how the plant grows and the plant
itself in terms of it, it's morphology and
[SPEAKER_13]: the agronomics about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: To me, that is just agriculture and
increasingly more and more of the people
[SPEAKER_13]: who do cultivate that plant are just
people who are growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have this weird transition that
we're having now in the USDA is a perfect
[SPEAKER_13]: example of that is that we're entering
this new cannabis agriculture phase and us
[SPEAKER_13]: custodians who are feel very, you know,
passionate about, you know, all the
[SPEAKER_13]: complexities.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to pass that on to them,
you know, because it's just, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: capitalism is a hell of a drug,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and the biggest contributors to the
dirty vape pens in this, in the country or
[SPEAKER_13]: in the, in the state probably are the big
commercial legal growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, you know, I know plenty of guys
who make extract who can tell you that
[SPEAKER_13]: when they purchase trim from big
commercial growers, like they say,
[SPEAKER_13]: they do the little quick tests and they
go, Hey man, this, this passes on flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: It passes on trim.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't pass on, on the extract,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So capitalism will be capitalism.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll do what it does, whether you're a
small farmer or a big farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But the plant is the plant and it's a
commodity to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's now an international commodity
and all these testing standards and stuff
[SPEAKER_13]: that we kind of established here in
California, Alec, you had a lot to do with
[SPEAKER_13]: like being a pioneer on testing.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're now being adopted by the entire
world.
[SPEAKER_13]: CFU counts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the whole world now wants all
cannabis to be irradiated, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause they didn't see the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you know, when they set the
land, the standard, like Australia
[SPEAKER_13]: standard and great Britain standard is 50
CFU.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, that's how is there
pesticide testing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's, it's onerous, you know,
and, and that's the point is that like we,
[SPEAKER_13]: we have, you know, we have to constantly
navigate that intersection between ag and
[SPEAKER_13]: culture and our, and our community.
[SPEAKER_13]: And honestly, you know, the way I see it
going is it is just going to be,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a commercial crop now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have, you know, we had to think that
way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the same time, protect it and
protect the small farmer and create
[SPEAKER_13]: premium products and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not stuck in a weird commodity
world.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's like, $5 wine, $50 wine,
$500 wine.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's common in the grape growing world,
but cannabis is just like a baseline that
[SPEAKER_13]: goes a little bit over and below.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where there's a lot of
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, no, it's, it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and, and, uh, AT&T brought up hoplite
and viroid, you know, now lab shopping for
[SPEAKER_13]: hoplite and viroid is the thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where it's like this kind of weird self
defeatist kind of thing where people are
[SPEAKER_13]: now, you know, choosing the most
beneficial COA for their, their own needs
[SPEAKER_13]: at that moment versus what does the whole
community, what does the entire like ag
[SPEAKER_13]: state of California need cannabis to be?
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they could have got, they could
have attacked hoplite and five years ago
[SPEAKER_13]: and eradicated it by now, if they
approached it, like they do other props,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, it was a relatively simple
approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to raise my hand because since
Kevin's here, you know, I had sent him
[SPEAKER_09]: some samples through the years of hoplite
and viroid, and it honestly scared the
[SPEAKER_09]: crap out of me and made me rethink
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, Kevin, you, you went pretty
deep on it, um, with that sample and then
[SPEAKER_09]: found other samples around the country and
world, I believe, and kind of went on a
[SPEAKER_09]: tear.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, do you believe that viroids
are playing a role in how we're getting a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of these products to market in terms
of, of why they're getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: botrytis is such a big deal and powdery
mildew and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think their immune systems of these
plants are being compromised and therefore
[SPEAKER_09]: all these other things are happening as a
result?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's definitely a genetic
component to this too, in that there are
[SPEAKER_08]: plants out there that seem to keep this in
the roots and it's unclear whether they
[SPEAKER_08]: have a yield impact.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, that's what was shown in the hop
industry too, that they have plants that
[SPEAKER_08]: have marginal 5% impact on on volatiles
and those that have like 40%, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it, it, depending on your cultivar,
it can, it can, it can create a yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you've got a plant that's,
that suffers from it and it's in the
[SPEAKER_08]: canopy, um, then you, you, you probably
got to get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but the, I think the problem we've
seen is a lot, everyone's running around
[SPEAKER_08]: testing roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and you really got to test both,
uh, mainly because there, if you do that,
[SPEAKER_08]: you'll wipe out the plants that keep it in
the roots, which are the ones that you
[SPEAKER_08]: want to retain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the ones that are, that are like
tolerant of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so we've, we've got a few lines that
we've been doing a lot of these
[SPEAKER_08]: experiments on, uh, and we can see that
you can bring it completely into flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that'll differ with the
plant that's infected versus not infected
[SPEAKER_08]: is it will turn purple, uh, on,
on, uh, the ones that's infected,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you won't have, you won't find it in
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You only find it in the roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you might find it in some green area
of the canopy, but anywhere the
[SPEAKER_08]: anthocyanins are off, it is undetectable
PCR.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so we've been encouraging people to
like cross that, that particular line is
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamaican line and it's not necessarily a
commercial line.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's an outdoor, um, line that's a
type two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so people have been trying to cross
that into type ones to see if they can
[SPEAKER_08]: move the trait into something that's more
relevant for like an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but, uh, there, there is a risk there
that if you hyper test and you only test
[SPEAKER_08]: the roots that you're going to weed out
the plants that you might want to breed
[SPEAKER_08]: with.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, you have to be a little bit
careful on, on like how you go about doing
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there, there was for a while this
period where everyone was just testing
[SPEAKER_08]: roots because it was always, it was more
easy to find there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but, uh, that means that you're,
you could be killing your moms that are
[SPEAKER_08]: likely to survive this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so the testing in the, in the canopy
and in the roots usually in veg and in
[SPEAKER_08]: flower is the way to really figure it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, because a lot of the plants it's
undetectable until you pop it into flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if it's in the, if it's in the
leaves in the canopy during flowering,
[SPEAKER_08]: probably you're going to have a yield
issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and, uh, it is very transmissible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it is not just from scissors.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are finding this in, um,
in, in the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they've been doing testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can see it's in, in, in for negation
systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some papers suggesting hop stunt
viral, which is very similar moves around
[SPEAKER_08]: in few serium spores.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so that can go through, you know,
mycelium networks if you're in the same
[SPEAKER_08]: like root zone, uh, spores that can move
it around potentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we, we have seen it in pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, now interesting thing about pollen is
if we take hop late and varied positive
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen and pop it on to these plants that
are known to keep it in the roots,
[SPEAKER_08]: the seeds that come out of that are clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, like there's like 2%, 3% of them that
are positive once you germinate them,
[SPEAKER_08]: but most of them come out clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so there are, there's other studies
others have done, I think in Arizona with
[SPEAKER_08]: plants that are more susceptible to this
and their seed ratios are much hotter.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like 40, 30 or 40% of the seeds
that they pop or end up positive.
[SPEAKER_08]: But those are plants that are known to not
suppress it into just the roots,
[SPEAKER_08]: but they're, they're known for it to go
into the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's nothing you can do much to
treat this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know that it's going to cause,
um, a pesticidal lab shopping issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe there's people running around trying
to get C of A's that show it's not there,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, like in a nursery setting or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in most people we interact with,
they want the sensitivity dial up so hot
[SPEAKER_08]: that it finds, you know, single molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, which again, is something I caution in
that if you have plants that are keeping
[SPEAKER_08]: this suppressed at a really late CT and
PCR, that means it's very low in copy
[SPEAKER_08]: number.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their immune system may be functioning
with it fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have a yield loss.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be a risk that it can move,
but, um, you know, there's a, there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: big difference between plants that are hot
at a CT of 20 versus plants that are hot
[SPEAKER_08]: at a CT of 30.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about a, uh, NCT's is, is like,
uh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw that with the, when we went on the
wild goose chase is going through all the
[SPEAKER_09]: moms that I had trying to chase it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we, we thought at one point that a
whole lot had been infected.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we, we kept on testing and all of
a sudden it just wasn't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: It went away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You had some that are out at past 30 and
we're just like, hold on, don't kill
[SPEAKER_08]: those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your plant might just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went on it guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went on a bender.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want quantitative tests because you
know, something has presence absence on
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to have that level of
information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the difference between 20 and 30 is
actually a thousand volts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so it's a thousand full difference in
the viral concentration in the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you're plants keeping it out at
really low numbers, uh, I, I'm,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious about that plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to breed with that plant because
it's suppressing it, um, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_08]: taking this kind of, you know,
chop all your mom's down and start over
[SPEAKER_08]: thing, because then we lose all the
genetics out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and, uh, it may end up setting us back
as opposed to moving us forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a plan that I tried.
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried to infect a plant that was just
always wouldn't test.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I tried to infect it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually grafting it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like pouring actually run off into
the roots and it still would test
[SPEAKER_13]: negative.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then another friend that,
um, has that same plant just recently
[SPEAKER_13]: tested positive.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure what the count was,
but the plan is healthy as can be.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, it's, it's one of those typhoid
Mary kind of, you know, really,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I noticed is that the,
the slower rooting plants that have some
[SPEAKER_13]: type of a fungal issue, like every dotted
plant that like really, really heavy
[SPEAKER_13]: dotted flower, when I rip up in the crown,
the crown, there's always some type of a
[SPEAKER_13]: fungal thing going on there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that relationship, I'd really love to
hear more about how that hop latent and
[SPEAKER_13]: fungal moving fungus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: When they're, when they're really hot with
hop late environment, there's often
[SPEAKER_08]: fusarium picking around.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, we, we try to, we try to scan for
those two, but the, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: when we're, when we're doing these
challenge studies, um, for a while,
[SPEAKER_08]: the field, which is grinding up hop late
and viral positive plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then trying to, you know, a break,
you know, put those onto the leaves with
[SPEAKER_08]: some injury.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you do that, you don't know what
else you're introducing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be inducing the Pythium or the
fusarium.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and so, uh, to solve that,
you really have to isolate hop late and
[SPEAKER_08]: viral.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went and actually synthesized a
circular form of this thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're now like the Wuhan of,
of, uh, of the fucking hop late
[SPEAKER_08]: environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we made the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you do that, you can get rid of
all the other unknowns.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can inject it into plants at like,
you know, 700 billion copies on an
[SPEAKER_08]: injection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these plants don't take it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, you're never going to get that
from a, from a mite or an insect or,
[SPEAKER_08]: or, um, any of these leaf hoppers,
they're just not going to move that much
[SPEAKER_08]: by right around, but we can take some of
these plants and really hammer them with
[SPEAKER_08]: direct injection of 700 billion of these
molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they don't end up getting positive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so it's, um, there are ones out there
that are tolerant to this thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you ever, you know, they're,
they're positive in the roots,
[SPEAKER_08]: like two weeks after flowering.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the CT starts.
[SPEAKER_08]: To creep a little bit south on us when it
starts going into flowering, but it never
[SPEAKER_08]: ends up in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this, there's a set of plants
out there that we've got to keep our eye
[SPEAKER_08]: on that are going to get us, breed us out
of this thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and, and, and the clear cutting
approach of any positivity, any signal at
[SPEAKER_08]: all, I think it's going to be really
dangerous because we're going to end up,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, basically obliterating all of these
plants that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see any one speck of this anywhere
in the plant, kill it is, is like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's how this is going to
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's going to be some plants out
there that, that, that can dance around
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have, we even saw like Mojave.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw one of the strawberry cough plants
that I've had for like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_09]: 18, 19 years that, that well, you would
never think that that would have anything
[SPEAKER_09]: if you didn't test it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, that's the other part of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be in the canopy and you not know
it until flowering.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, definitely some instances there,
but we're counting on you Fletch out
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get, let's get that gene pool
sorted.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did see it with some of your leaf
hoppers though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, I, I had a, I had the, the UK cheese
cause I just kept it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to keep studying what would
happen with it as it went through its life
[SPEAKER_09]: cycle, knowing that it had hopladen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I stuck it in a part of my property
that is just like super isolated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I thought, well, why don't I put
like a small greenhouse here and put six
[SPEAKER_09]: plants in it that aren't, that I know are
absolutely clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I saw leaf hoppers, I was smoking a
joint one day back there and I was just
[SPEAKER_09]: like watching these things just go boing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, huh, wonder if those are
munching on that and then passing it
[SPEAKER_09]: around to all these other plants around
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I decided to put the greenhouse
there and sure enough, I sent Kevin the
[SPEAKER_09]: samples after I, you know, week after week
and we kept testing and all of a sudden it
[SPEAKER_09]: was like nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, boom, it just hit for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, the, there are, I mean,
it's, you know, it's, this isn't brought
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a rocket science here,
but it was confirming and really made me
[SPEAKER_09]: feel, you know, like we needed to better
understand more about the vectors than we
[SPEAKER_09]: thought, because that's it's not just
touch, feel human.
[SPEAKER_09]: I smoked a cigarette or I touched on the
plant or whatever, you know, insert here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of things that we're not paying
attention to around us and in the wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's as, as outdoor growers,
as a lot of us are, we don't know what's
[SPEAKER_09]: in our garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: Until it's far too late.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, it's, um, you know, it's,
it's just good to know ahead of time that
[SPEAKER_09]: if you can test and use what Kevin's
develops to, to help you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that at scale, um, I would have,
it would have been devastating what I went
[SPEAKER_09]: through to try to kind of go back and go
through all the moms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I did clean everything and then
isolate them and then bring them back in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the amount of downtime that took was
nuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just was really throwing everything
out, cleaning and making sure I didn't
[SPEAKER_09]: touch something.
[SPEAKER_09]: That had it on it still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and that, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I wanted to bring up
earlier is, um, you know, some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: problems we're talking about, they may
kind of self correct themselves due to the
[SPEAKER_02]: economics of cannabis long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of these really big farms that
particularly, like you were just saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: going through these things, it's too
expensive for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they use all these alternative
methods, you know, pesticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the reason those farms still
exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: To this day is because of the export
market, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way they're staying alive,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they had to sell all that oil
in California where they're growing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, there's not enough consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most it like even the thousand
light grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know a lot of people that grow
most of the really big grows in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, indoor grows their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a trap packs keeping everybody
alive, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't sell all their flower into the
legal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of this just may be a,
you know, a self correcting issue where
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially the, when, when all the
different markets have their own
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation, like map places like
Massachusetts and Maryland and Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: used to be great export markets from
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so, I mean, people still do it,
but it's not like it used to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: it used to be a hundred percent of the
product going there came from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now a big portion of the consumers are
buying from big legal farms and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, and depending on the state's
laws, you may continue to have these
[SPEAKER_02]: issues, but in places like Washington and
Oregon, pretty much all the, most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: big grows are all shutting down and it's
happening in a lot of other places too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Canada is a great example of
it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, I mean, how many of those big
$300 million, you know, a hundred acre
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor grows that can be growth put up are
still operational.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not, because the market finally
becomes localized once the export
[SPEAKER_02]: exporting of all this excess product
dissipates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then, and then now you have to,
to satisfy local consumers, which are much
[SPEAKER_02]: more picky than people that don't have
access in export markets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, well said.
[SPEAKER_13]: And on that, on that CDFA crop statistics
report, I mentioned earlier, there's
[SPEAKER_13]: about, you know, there's 10, 10 or 15 or
20 crops that are a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_13]: produced in California for export to
either the rest of the country or even
[SPEAKER_13]: considerable percentage to the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like Alec mentioned, all the best ag
land is in the red zone.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the reality is this eventually
turns into agriculture and plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the economy of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_13]: You grow the plants that are best suited
for a particular region for, because of
[SPEAKER_13]: climate and input and infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the environment and all that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, that's kind of what California
was and what it will be.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like, I consult with people in places
where, and I say to them from the
[SPEAKER_13]: beginning, I'm like, this is an
opportunity for you guys to be a part of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis right now, but in the future,
this all goes away.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause for you to grow the way you do now,
where it costs you $3 a gram, $4 a gram to
[SPEAKER_13]: produce.
[SPEAKER_13]: It won't happen in the future when this is
really grown as efficiently as it can be
[SPEAKER_13]: in places like California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can I ask you a question, Mojave?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With if, if like, let's, let's just say
export markets don't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just a producer in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what percentage of the people
growing like without an export,
[SPEAKER_02]: like let's say the state was really good
at enforcing the law and making sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you grew in California had to
be sold in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many outdoor and greenhouse grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would there even need to be this?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many indoor lights in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be almost none existing on a
localized consumer level.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we grow enough weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Often we grow enough weed for all our
neighbors, just in our own backyards.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so it's, it all goes away and
California is really good at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're actually really good at go.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go to, if you go to the CDFA and
you say, Hey, look, I want to grow this
[SPEAKER_13]: crop next year, they'll say, Hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know, we grow a lot of that crop
and you're probably not going to make that
[SPEAKER_13]: much money.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you guys grow 20% or more of that
crop, then the commodity price goes down
[SPEAKER_13]: and they protect that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They protect the commodity.
[SPEAKER_13]: They protect the farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they even have, I believe they even
have mechanisms where they can even buy
[SPEAKER_13]: you out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, Hey, look, you know, you're going to
tank the raisin industry right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to keep the prices at a
certain point.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they subsidize you.
[SPEAKER_13]: They subsidize your farm in order to keep
things like don't grow too much.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's bad for everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they didn't do that with cat.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they just wild wild west,
right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and they never really did the math,
the very basic math of what is,
[SPEAKER_13]: what is needed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me that applies and that applies to
the whole world though.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause eventually cannabis will be
normalized.
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be regular.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of these markets will have to
adjust.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have to go like, Hey, we did it for
a while, but we don't do it anymore
[SPEAKER_13]: because now Mexico's online or,
you know, California is back onto
[SPEAKER_13]: interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all this big transition and it's
just, it's all temporary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is this land somewhere else that
doesn't have the red zone issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's this someone's going to find
a better solution to do it cheaper,
[SPEAKER_02]: better, whatever, and access the market
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a lot of cases, you know,
California is really just not competitive
[SPEAKER_02]: other than because, you know, cost of
power costs, the land cost, all these
[SPEAKER_02]: other things, you know, the pesticide,
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think, you know, Canada is
probably not the best example,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the out, it's hard to grow lots of
outdoor relatively speaking there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, what percentage of the
Canadian market, legal market is outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: and greenhouse grown flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd bet it's, I bet it's less than the
indoor, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Holland, do you have any idea of
what percentage in Canada it is?
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no idea, but I know that if you,
I mean, look at Holland, Holland still
[SPEAKER_13]: crushes it on ag export.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't have the climate for it,
but they said, this is where we're going
[SPEAKER_13]: to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be a greenhouse controlled
environment, agriculture country.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they nailed it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like, you can be that,
but if you're competing with a pound of
[SPEAKER_13]: flour grown in Vermont versus a pound of
flour grown in California in 10 years,
[SPEAKER_13]: the costs are going to be very lopsided.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you're talking about like a really
beautifully grown bell pepper from Holland
[SPEAKER_13]: versus a really beautifully grown bell
pepper from Canada, they can compete
[SPEAKER_13]: because they're both the same model,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're both, but neither,
neither of those business models that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have exist without export as well for all
those bell peppers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they would never have that
business if they're just selling locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of my point is once it,
once everybody can grow indoor everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: legally to supply their local market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people are going to try to take
advantage of that for that, for the
[SPEAKER_02]: financial reasons you don't have in it
that where's, where's all this weed
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to go to third world countries
that buy weed for less than you can
[SPEAKER_02]: produce it for in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go the other way.
[SPEAKER_13]: What if, I mean, hypothetically,
like what if cannabis like is only $50 a
[SPEAKER_13]: pound for beautiful sungrown outdoor
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then all of a sudden all the indoor
has to rethink about like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa, what kind of brands are we
supporting with this high cost?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only focusing on your customer base
at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had, you've got your brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You figured out a profit margin that works
for them and you as a, as a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all you get.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It reminds me of strawberries in the
eighties, late seventies, early eighties,
[SPEAKER_09]: how they had to figure out how to chop
California up and then export it and
[SPEAKER_09]: figure out cold chain and do all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually a girl I met that's got
a, he has a farm in, in Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_09]: called farming first.
[SPEAKER_09]: He runs it and he comes from that world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he talked a lot about his cost per
pound to me when I first met him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just was blown away that he was
thinking about the minute details of,
[SPEAKER_09]: of everything that we're speaking about
along the supply chain and what that cost
[SPEAKER_09]: structure was of that, that pound and how
that fit within the larger model in which
[SPEAKER_09]: he was creating.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just literally was like a blow wind
in my, my hair was flying behind me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, wow, you're, you know,
you're, you're futurist thinking about
this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now Driscoll's is all over the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're growing in Australia.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're growing in greenhouses in Japan.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like, they took that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like, yeah, we have to export this
model.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's, it's a really interesting model
in terms of agriculture because it's sort
[SPEAKER_09]: of our dichotomy of like, how do we,
how do we grow enough?
[SPEAKER_09]: But how do we get it to people for it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then how's it clean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's strawberries are some of
the dirtiest, you know, dirtiest fruits in
[SPEAKER_09]: the world, which is called that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it all has, it's a very similar day
for Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got one big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% of the people smoke weed and a hundred
percent of the people eat food.
[SPEAKER_02]: The volume we need to produce is a
fraction tiny compared to what the ag
[SPEAKER_02]: industry actually looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're most of, most of these
business models that people think are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to work are never going to work in
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the, once the, the, the playing field
has been leveled worldwide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think where you're alluding to is a very
simplistic thing that I've alluded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got, I've landed on often,
which is we've got it all wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and we're kind of, we're kind of in
the middle of, of how do we go forward and
[SPEAKER_09]: how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Be being mindful as we move forward,
because we will get it wrong again.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a matter of what it's just,
we have to figure out the things we can
[SPEAKER_09]: change and, and of what can we change?
[SPEAKER_09]: What, what impact can we make to make it
better?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's, you know, what we're
all throwing great ideas around today as
[SPEAKER_09]: to do that, but it's going to take someone
in policy, I think, to really make sure
[SPEAKER_09]: that that drives through.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone follows the same plan,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's got to walk together,
so to speak.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise it's like, if one guy's over
here spraying Eagle 20 and the other
[SPEAKER_09]: guy's, you know, growing perfectly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, they both go to market
and they're lab shopping to get their
[SPEAKER_09]: products and they both get to market
somehow.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: The control that every other industry has
figured out is subsidies and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, uh, growers unions, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they control their supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we met, we control how much you grow,
what you can sell for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't fuck it up for all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's the only thing that that's
worked for everything else for the last
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially without that farming in
America is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: John beer tractors in America done all
done without subsidies and growers unions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're striking a chord with me because I,
you know, I come from the, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked in film for a number of years and
that's, you know, there's film unions for
[SPEAKER_09]: a reason because when you call gaffer and
you need somebody to lay your set.
[SPEAKER_09]: They, you know, you have reliable people
that you can call to come.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need a reliable grower that can come
and grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that really makes a lot of sense to
me, but there is, you know, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of conversation in between that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's as simple as saying
we need just a union, but I do think
[SPEAKER_09]: there's, I'd like what you said there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it, we do need to, we need to have,
um, checks and balances like, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to have people that if we're going
to bring in to pay them a fee to consult
[SPEAKER_09]: or be on the team, there needs to be some
sort of results or some sort of,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, you know, checks and balances man
behind why they're there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I think you're, yeah, you're
striking chords with me on that man,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I just don't know how we would put it
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if I get a kind of way in real
quick, um, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: just thinking about cannabis as like this
idea of this national and international
[SPEAKER_07]: export, you know, eventually, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever there's been this, you know,
opening up of interstate commerce and kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of like what's happening in Canada and
Columbia and elsewhere where it's like
[SPEAKER_07]: internationally exporting, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, you know, I mean, I think there's
the, the regional, I think Mavi,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're hitting a part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like this, the Appalachian
region realities of kind of where cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: does grow best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and also practices around
understanding how to care for it to the
[SPEAKER_07]: point of consumer purchase, to where you
can actually preserve the most precious
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatic attributes that define the
quality of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes to the most sophisticated
understanding of the value of what it is
[SPEAKER_07]: versus pure biomass, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where all the aromatic products are gone,
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's reduced then to a point of THC
where it can still be distilled.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can still, you know, be made into other
types of products, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I think kind of the idea of
like the leveling of playing field,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I think it happens within each
state within anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it happens with this ongoing
dialogue and, and, and what we like in
[SPEAKER_07]: each area we're in, I'm just proud of
understanding how the differentiator
[SPEAKER_07]: really exists.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you know, it's like, you can't just,
I mean, you know, such a big reason why in
[SPEAKER_07]: Oklahoma there's such a high percentage of
indoor farms versus outdoor farms is cause
[SPEAKER_07]: you can't grow outdoor in Oklahoma because
of how toxified the environment is because
[SPEAKER_07]: of the last, you know, multiple decades of
agriculture, you know, and, and the amount
[SPEAKER_07]: of erosion and the amount of heavy metals
that blown around in the wind,
[SPEAKER_07]: you couldn't even pass a test,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I think that speaks for a lot of
the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that speaks for a lot of the world
where agriculture happens, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what, you know, cannabis is helping
expose like what you did for the land,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's like, as if there is,
you know, this actual kind of like rallied
[SPEAKER_07]: for lobbied for kind of, you know,
I mean, cause just speaking for California
[SPEAKER_07]: as example, California helped,
you know, kind of established at the time,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I mean, cause it's not about
going so far, just like each state or each
[SPEAKER_07]: country building on the next to make it
even more and more strict.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about testing for the sake of public,
like maximizing public health and safety,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, but like not putting such
ridiculous regulations over the top on it
[SPEAKER_07]: to where you have to gamma radiate,
sterilize all your weed and Terp zap
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now you are again reduced to a
commodity, you know, but it's like there
[SPEAKER_07]: are testing regulations that are rallied
for and lobbied for that help kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: ensure the integrity of this plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think that's one of the
biggest things that those closest to the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant have like such a competitive
advantage, you know, of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_07]: awareness around where to find lands,
you know, so many people have spent
[SPEAKER_07]: millions of dollars you know, I feel like
the more hubris people come in with
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking they're just going to make a
bunch of money is proportional to how
[SPEAKER_07]: quick they face plant, you know,
you see it on a corporate level,
[SPEAKER_07]: you see it on, you know, kind of all these
huge multi hundreds of million dollars
[SPEAKER_07]: losses and face plants that have happened
because this isn't just another
[SPEAKER_07]: agricultural commodity, you know,
and I think kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: leaning into what, you know, I think
testing brings, you know, on a global
[SPEAKER_07]: scale really helps, I think, solidify the
permanence of kind of those culturally
[SPEAKER_07]: connected at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like in each state, like no,
no individual cultivator or manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, that's working with the flower
can, you know, is even ready for
[SPEAKER_07]: interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't even in their own state
figured out how to preserve their turps,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, preserve what they have in their
possession.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like keep the cabbage in
the fridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like what happens in two weeks of
just fucking that off, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and just allowing kind of it to just
completely lose its value as a vegetable,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and so I think kind of just,
you know, the perseverance and the
[SPEAKER_07]: resilience the plant brings, I think on
the level of working with it and how much
[SPEAKER_07]: it helps you to like manage chaos and like
figure out and find the way and kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: learn the lesson, you know, from the face
plant that happened before.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there's so much like
awareness there that I don't think,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, any farm on like big ag or big
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just like this plant and what's
happening with it is the antithesis of
[SPEAKER_07]: what they've done and what they do and
what they know, you know, and so I think
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of, you know, being able to kind of,
you know, on that idea of like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, once this opens up and it's
direct consumer kind of in ways kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like wine and the wine model, I mean,
it's like, you know, across all testing
[SPEAKER_07]: we've ever performed, there's like,
you know, it's about 1.4% total turp
[SPEAKER_07]: content in dried flower and then all the
other, you know, non-tested trace of
[SPEAKER_07]: volatile aromatics that are even more
volatile than turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the potential one is most sticky,
chronic, you can stick it to a window is
[SPEAKER_07]: like three to five and a half percent,
like, you know, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's also is there and taking a testing
lab, a lot of testing labs are like 9%
[SPEAKER_07]: turps every time, you know, so it's about
real quality in the data.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but the reality is, is 60 to 80% of
all turps and all volatile aromatics are
[SPEAKER_07]: gone by the time most herb is on
dispensary shelves or retail shelves or
[SPEAKER_07]: gas, you know, gas station shelves with
some Delta, you know, with HHC,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, but you know, kind of like we've
seen this like really incredible thing
[SPEAKER_07]: happening in Oregon and in California
where people have figured out like this
[SPEAKER_07]: continued cold supply chain of custody
where they like, you know, have very
[SPEAKER_07]: actively monitor and like ensure like the
rapidness to market, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: because the average batch takes like 30,
45 days to make it dispensary shelves.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a huge time for like loss to set in
and you're like, what was 3% now at 1%
[SPEAKER_07]: because the average herb on dispensary
shelves is like 1% or less.
[SPEAKER_07]: The average pre-roll on dispensary shelves
is like half a percent or less.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like cardboard, like, you know,
and I think that's a big reason why people
[SPEAKER_07]: are just like, there's a market for the
juicing of like all these butterscotch
[SPEAKER_07]: flavors and all these other things because
nobody can, everybody's like running
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no brand loyalty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's just chasing their tails,
trying to buy something that tastes or
[SPEAKER_07]: flavorful or has any type of uniqueness to
it, you know, and so, but the thing is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is, you know, we, I think a lot of the
Oregon farmers, you know, kind of like
[SPEAKER_07]: made it through the collapse and kind of
like now rebuilding, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like they've, they've, they've begun
to substantially quickly be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: differentiate and, and, you know,
build brand loyalty and sell it quicker
[SPEAKER_07]: than it's trimmed at the highest price the
market can bear in the deepest floods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And California it's happening too,
you know, cause those people, they like,
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of continuously doubling down on
production, double down on preservation
[SPEAKER_07]: infrastructure and like, you know,
kind of maintaining super tight
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature and humidity differentials to
treat the herb, you know, so that there's
[SPEAKER_07]: very little to no loss.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and they're, they're like
working within the Kelvin cycle to harvest
[SPEAKER_07]: like before sun rises and temperatures
rise where the off-gassing of turps
[SPEAKER_07]: happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so I think there's so much and
like ancestral awareness, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: around those working with the plant and
they give a shit, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, is kind of, you know,
areas where in each individual state,
[SPEAKER_07]: people can really figure out how to
differentiate and how to like bring their
[SPEAKER_07]: turps like hundreds of percent more
present, you know, than anything else on
[SPEAKER_07]: the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you can figure that out,
you know, I feel like that that's what,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, Oregon's shown.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, and California, it's like,
that's how you build resilience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause at least what you have when it's not
selling as quick as super preserved and
[SPEAKER_07]: you can always kind of be on that highest
end, you know, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then kind of, I think, you know,
being able to just like identify and work
[SPEAKER_07]: with, you know, people, you know,
cause cause that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the, the, you know, now that
testing integrity is coming back in
[SPEAKER_07]: California and everybody's freaked out
that they're going to get caught up in
[SPEAKER_07]: recalls or reputational damage scenarios
because of being associated with a shit
[SPEAKER_07]: lab, you know, they're like, it's shifting
people's priorities around like,
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, maybe if I'm paying hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year to a lab,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe I should work with the lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to set me up for success,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's really what testing and
kind of, you know, offers, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: with, you know, being able to help,
you know, kind of ensure you don't fail,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and then don't, and don't set up
for massive fail scenarios by,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, making sure you're not
introducing hop late and viral or
[SPEAKER_07]: aspergillus to cultivation and being able
to kind of, you know, like identify if
[SPEAKER_07]: you're the land you're working on or
before you purchase like a cut flower
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse, you know, see what kind of
problems are going to haunt you,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and, and choose like,
you know, but I think a lot of these
[SPEAKER_07]: things are the biggest differentiating
factors that as testing regulations really
[SPEAKER_07]: set in, you know, and the integrity in it
is happening because you're seeing just
[SPEAKER_07]: the, the whole like lab fraudulent thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's a national topic in every
state and it's huge news, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's, I think the more that there
becomes integrity in that and states kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of build their own testing labs and test
the testers, it's going to help really
[SPEAKER_07]: like, in the long run, help individual
groups be able to differentiate and
[SPEAKER_07]: survive in a state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as it goes national and even the
more international, like have the biggest,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, differentiating factors because
heavy metal testing in California,
[SPEAKER_07]: nobody's ever in the United States have
had heavy metal testing in place,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like in Europe, they have
really, you know, 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: they've put in really strict, heavy metal
testing requirements and the international
[SPEAKER_07]: cacao market learned that cadmium and
cacao is a really big issue, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's applied a remedial of cadmium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's grown around areas where ag
happens, it remediates out of the soil,
[SPEAKER_07]: it pulls out of the soil into the cacao.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you have like super high levels of
cacao in the, in the Dean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, so international chocolate makers
have to learn this and clean up their
[SPEAKER_07]: whole supply chain and mix, you know,
mountainous grown cacao with other cacao
[SPEAKER_07]: to kind of make sure that they don't fail
just so they can sell into the European
[SPEAKER_07]: union.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the only other people in the
United States that have ever figured that
[SPEAKER_07]: out or cannabis farmers in California,
you know, it's like, because, because
[SPEAKER_07]: heavy metal testing has been implemented,
nothing in the United States has been that
[SPEAKER_07]: way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, that's, I think a huge
different, you know, the ability to
[SPEAKER_07]: survive, you know, export market,
I think in areas where testing and public
[SPEAKER_07]: health and safety is going to be a thing I
think is going to be ultimately the
[SPEAKER_07]: biggest thing that helps the culture and
those like they give a shit about the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant survive and it's going to keep out
the kooks, you know, and the these like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, hubristic dudes that are just
face planning left and right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like, I want to go back to something
that you had said earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: you were talking about closed loop
extraction and concentrating.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like you could, you could run a clean
test on flower material that would look
[SPEAKER_12]: clean and would pass, but then when you
extract that material, you would actually
[SPEAKER_12]: see now things failing because you're,
you're concentrating, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: the oily cuticle off the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like, like I'm looking at some data
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's, I mean, and you're probably more
aware of this than anyone else on this
[SPEAKER_12]: panel is that the level of sophistication
of our analytical toolbox has increased
[SPEAKER_12]: exponentially.
[SPEAKER_12]: In like the last 10 to 15 years,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, like we can see pico grams.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we can see things that, you know,
again, I, I used to use the analogy of
[SPEAKER_12]: taking a lint brush to a New York City
sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to find everything you're
going to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't necessarily put the spec at zero
ppm, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, beyond ppm,
there's there's what?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ppb.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you go down to parts per
trillion.
[SPEAKER_12]: But so the thing I wanted to show you,
I wanted to pull up some recent data from
[SPEAKER_12]: mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're, we're able to make, we're able
to make a check this out, dude,
[SPEAKER_12]: because even like a handful of years ago
on hash church, we were talking about this
[SPEAKER_12]: and we were still in like the low
nineties, but we could routinely produce
[SPEAKER_12]: from clean flower that test clean for
heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_12]: That test clean for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can routinely produce a live resin
where the THC total is, is in the high
[SPEAKER_12]: seven.
[SPEAKER_12]: These total cannabinoids is about 91%
total terpenes in these live resin sauces
[SPEAKER_12]: are like seven and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you add up these percentages,
man, there ain't a whole lot left,
[SPEAKER_12]: man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, like on hash church,
like I knew we were on maybe like about
[SPEAKER_12]: four or five years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were talking about, you know,
what is that last little bit?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like how can we find out like,
and you know, Ian Oswald and those guys
[SPEAKER_12]: down at abstracts basically now teasing
out all these volatile sulfur components.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I had volatile sulfur components
onto my live resin that I'm testing 99,
[SPEAKER_12]: 99 plus.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I just take the terpenes alone,
add that to the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is from a third party lab.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm at like 99 plus percentage.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've characterized 99% of what's in my
jar.
[SPEAKER_12]: To me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's just right from where we
were just even like four or five years
[SPEAKER_12]: ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard extra action and not live resin
kind of, you know, yeah, there's been,
[SPEAKER_12]: but that's fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like there's like no big unknown in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, again, what, what's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I mean, the net, if you look at the
anatomy of a bud, you know, primarily
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids within the glandular
trichomes and resin, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Primarily cannabinoids followed by the
primary and secondary turps, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There, which really five to nine of them
really constitute a majority of what is
[SPEAKER_07]: there, you know, that could be in flower
up to three to five and a half percent in
[SPEAKER_07]: live resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, up to like seven to 9%,
you know, kind of from what we've seen,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and like, when you start getting
that all together and there's this like
[SPEAKER_07]: remaining percentage, which, you know,
it's, it's not a lot, but you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that, three plus percent, whatever more,
less, you know, kind of based on
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction process, based on purity,
based on kind of, you know, live resin
[SPEAKER_07]: versus not, you know, there is all these
other, yeah, volatile trace aromatics,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That really define kind of so much of the
flavor and aroma aspects, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, flavor, basically what the point I'm
trying to make here is that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, to me, we're real close to
describing a hundred percent of everything
[SPEAKER_12]: that's in the jar.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like there's no, like mystery oil or weird
shit from like 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Parts for a hundred, but you're looking at
parts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some, some of these pesticides are down in
parts per thousand, you know, another
[SPEAKER_08]: decimal place over or parts per million,
which is even further, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're getting close though,
right, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it seems like again, so what I'm
trying to, what I'm trying to illustrate,
[SPEAKER_12]: which I don't think I'm doing a good job
at describing, not only has there been a,
[SPEAKER_12]: a increase in the level of precision and
accuracy, accuracy of what we can test for
[SPEAKER_12]: in cannabis products, including down to
the PPB and PPT levels, but extraction has
[SPEAKER_12]: really become, you know, really,
I think it's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, to where black hash oil crude,
just open blasting with mystery oil and
[SPEAKER_12]: God knows what else was in that crap.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember when injury used to be on
member Marcus, when injury would,
[SPEAKER_12]: we come on hash church and we would try to
talk to him about testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was always kind of really guarded
because he thought that his process was
[SPEAKER_12]: somehow unique when really passing a
hydrocarbon solvent over, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis and extracting the oleol resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty, pretty much like making
drip coffee.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I thought the one thing he did
that was novel was dimple the inside of
[SPEAKER_11]: his reactor to create cavitation and
eliminate his channeling that impressed
[SPEAKER_11]: me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I was never able to see like a set
of data that showed the impact that that
[SPEAKER_12]: had either in productivity or resin
quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, from what I remember, because I used
to always have conversations about him,
[SPEAKER_12]: about testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's when this whole mystery oil
thing was coming into play.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was always thought of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if you're multiply distilling your
solvent, you're constantly taking just the
[SPEAKER_12]: bottles off.
[SPEAKER_12]: But could there be in your, in your early
fractions, if you don't do multiple
[SPEAKER_12]: distillation, could there be that mystery
oil, the crap from the lubrication of the
[SPEAKER_12]: couplings, you know, when they're handling
hydrocarbon solvents and other shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember that stuff, Alec,
we were talking about that years ago on
[SPEAKER_12]: hash church, trying to figure out like
what that last little few percent of some
[SPEAKER_12]: oligomeric chlorine, polymer bullshit.
[SPEAKER_12]: That comes along with the ride in these
gases.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, on the on the aromatic side of
things, which is really cool, because,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, you mentioned abstracts,
definitely epic did some very pioneering
[SPEAKER_07]: research helping to kind of really just
show kind of some of these realities,
[SPEAKER_07]: right, which are, you know, because in the
aromatics, you know, the majority of
[SPEAKER_07]: what's there are the primary secondary
terpenes that very well probably have the
[SPEAKER_07]: most biologically active effects,
you know, entourage, cannabinoid stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then there's all these other part per
billion part per truth, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: trillion part per, you know, 1000 type
level compounds that are there in tiny
[SPEAKER_07]: fraction, the level of terpenes,
but you know, clearly have substantial
[SPEAKER_07]: effects on adding aroma or flavor to,
you know, bring out the uniqueness of
[SPEAKER_07]: various aspects of cannabis and,
and, you know, identifying, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: helping, you know, like the idea of
thiols, right, and these sulfuric
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds that really bring the gas
aspect, you know, which seem to be very
[SPEAKER_07]: volatile, right, like, you know,
relative to terps, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's like these other types of
compounds that are the what, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: they described as the tropic kind of
sulfur compounds, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, that I wanted to bring up a
story about the Emerald Cup with that I
[SPEAKER_07]: thought was really fascinating,
because we extended this year,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because, you know, over the last
few years, we've been will test chemo type
[SPEAKER_07]: cannab terps, you know, of all the
entrance, you know, help to sort and buy
[SPEAKER_07]: aroma and flavor right in this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: grouping like with like, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jack and Hayes, Jack and Hayes,
tropical floral, tropical floral,
[SPEAKER_07]: awesome mean, right, gas desserts,
sweet and dream types, exotic,
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've we had that, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but it was really interesting,
because over the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_07]: we started to see this really fascinating
trend, right, because historically tangy,
[SPEAKER_07]: right, smell of tangy, forbidden fruit,
Calio, Agent Orange, right, it's Miracene,
[SPEAKER_07]: really, really high Miracene, low Ivory
other terpene, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very distinct.
[SPEAKER_07]: smell, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually, it's not a turp,
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's these tropical kind of sulfur type
compounds that that abstracts is
[SPEAKER_07]: describing, you know, but what's actually
interesting about those is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is just a pure observation from
my nose and just smell of cannabis over
[SPEAKER_07]: the years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's that volatile.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it actually sticks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's one of the ones that's like
really heavy and it sticks around,
[SPEAKER_07]: like as all the turps go away,
right, it's super present smell across,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, these these, these, these
different profiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point I wanted to make was,
you know, so historically, right,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's all these tangy, forbidden fruit,
you know, Calio, Agent Orange types that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're always in the sweet and dream
category.
[SPEAKER_07]: But over the last couple of years in the
Emerald Cup, we started observationally,
[SPEAKER_07]: anecdotally through our nose and through
the judges nose be we started to see the
[SPEAKER_07]: smell popping up in other primary terpene
categories.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'd see it popping up in the dessert
category over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dessert category, karyophylline,
limonene, like, which is a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: gelato, sweating cake, Sunday driver type
strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those like all of a sudden,
there's mimosa, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Tropicana, there's there's
Sangria, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are and those are strains that
wash really well in hash making.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's and those are the
karyophylline, limonene strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that smell starts showing up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then also like this year, like we even
saw in the Emerald Cup data, we even saw
[SPEAKER_07]: like things like, like if you've ever
smelled clementine, right, or orange
[SPEAKER_07]: creamsicle, which just won one of the
awards in the Emerald Cup, performs
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's got that tangy,
like citrus smell, but it's in the
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenoline category, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like clementine, there's like,
we know that like straddle of the edge of
[SPEAKER_07]: being one of the other, you know,
but it's again, the shared kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatic that's a non-terp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this year in the Emerald Cup,
we actually, you know, kind of where
[SPEAKER_07]: science, you know, because a lot of these
compounds too, like in flour, like in
[SPEAKER_07]: extract, sure, you might be able to start
testing them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in flour, they're like undetectable,
you know, by most even most sensitive
[SPEAKER_07]: instrumentation, you know, and,
and even and for what it's worth,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of these aromatics, they don't even
make it through harvest, because people
[SPEAKER_07]: are harvesting in the middle of the day in
the hottest times outside of the Kelvin
[SPEAKER_07]: cycle, where the off gassing of the
aromatics happen in the early part of the
[SPEAKER_07]: day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, so I think kind of, you know,
and also how people dry, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of these really precious aromatics
don't make it through.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of them, like the tangy
notes, they make it through past when the
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes go.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but my point is, is this year in the
Emerald Cup, you know, everything with
[SPEAKER_07]: Terp sorted, they get anonymized,
presented the judges within its own
[SPEAKER_07]: category.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like red stickers, the terpenoline,
Jack and Hayes types.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, but this year, because we,
you know, we noticed that that smell of
[SPEAKER_07]: tangy, like that, that citrus hint,
it was, it was, it was probably,
[SPEAKER_07]: there was probably as many of that smell
entered as there were at like OG and gas
[SPEAKER_07]: and the whole competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what was funny, it was everybody was
entering it, thinking it was exotic,
[SPEAKER_07]: they were entering it into what they were
calling the exotic, you know, because we
[SPEAKER_07]: get, you know, the Emerald Cup opens for
people to be able to kind of put what they
[SPEAKER_07]: think category it should be in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody was entering tangy and stuff
as and mimosa is exotic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it, you know, and so it turned out to
be like, as much or more as the whole gas
[SPEAKER_07]: category.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so basically, all the judges after the
anonymized sort, presentation,
[SPEAKER_07]: a present of the data, and our judges
kits, when everybody was going through,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, all of the judges were empowered
to take, you know, to with their nose,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, single out any that smelled
citrusy, note it, and single out any that
[SPEAKER_07]: smelled truly exotic to them, and and
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and so yeah, so we created its own
turkey class, you know, that we're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be presenting through the data,
like that was, you know, the judge,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the consensus of the data of
like the judges picks of the smell,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, kind of correlating,
and those kind of being going into their
[SPEAKER_07]: own category, and, and then judge within
that category.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because because basically,
there was a tremendous amount of the
[SPEAKER_07]: entries that were in the Miracene
category, there's a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: those entries that were in the carry off
in limonene dessert category.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a couple that were in the
turpentine category.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, so yeah, but take a look tomorrow
to Mark's point here on the percentages.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that the abstracts folks have presented
a cam at a couple years now, it's really
[SPEAKER_08]: cool about data is how low concentration
these things are, and how pungent they are
[SPEAKER_08]: right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the VSC three in the Basio gelato,
which is the one that's got the highest
[SPEAKER_08]: factory score is micrograms per MIG.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's so micrograms per MIG,
it's about one in 1000 micrograms are 10
[SPEAKER_08]: to the minus six MIGs are 10 to the minus
third.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a 10 to the minus three effect
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're talking about 10 to the minus
two of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's like one part per 100,000,
creating one of the highest olfactory
[SPEAKER_08]: scores.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just fascinating, these sulfur
compounds are really, really potent.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the human's nose to pick them
up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, like orders of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Two orders of magnitude, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Several.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I am the Terps are in the
percentages, which are parts per 100.
[SPEAKER_08]: This we're talking about 1000.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like 1000 times more thoughts,
more potent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the beauty of the human nose
and the olfactory olfactory spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's the most sensitive mass
spectrometer on the planet, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's what's really cool about kind
of the thing that the Amocup is like to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, be able to, you know,
as science is kind of helping to define
[SPEAKER_07]: some of these things, be able to take and
push the system based on our own nose and
[SPEAKER_07]: ability to kind of sort things,
these categories.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what's really fascinating to
me, Kevin and Dr. Mark, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: is just how some of these super trace part
per billion, whatever level compounds that
[SPEAKER_07]: are there, like in this sulfuric world,
you know, there's the gas, which to me,
[SPEAKER_07]: like from own anecdotes and just data,
what I've seen, the gas note goes away way
[SPEAKER_07]: quicker than the Terps do, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to the tangy note, which
observationally stays way longer as the
[SPEAKER_07]: Terps go away.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that type of correlation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Couldn't there be kind of like,
like, I always, when I think about
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes and the odor of cannabis,
I always think of a symphony, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you think, like, there could be a
couple violins, and there could be,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, a couple violas.
[SPEAKER_12]: And really, I mean, like, if you think
about it, like, so yeah, you have
[SPEAKER_12]: valencine, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is not limonene, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So an interesting thing about valencine,
valencine, if you open a bottle of it,
[SPEAKER_12]: it smells just like Valencia oranges.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you take, so valencine is a
sesquiterpinoid, or it's a sesquiterpene,
[SPEAKER_12]: actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when it oxidizes up to the
sesquiterpenoid nucleotone, it changes it
[SPEAKER_12]: to grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's so fucking cool thinking that,
again, valencine can basically convert to
[SPEAKER_12]: a more grapefruit note, just on oxidation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that might be happening, say,
like, in the cure of the flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe, like, valencine is kind of like
a pre-terpinoid precursor that ultimately,
[SPEAKER_12]: in the cure, cures up to nucleotone,
which, again, is going to give a more
[SPEAKER_12]: grapefruit kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I could just give a quick shout out
to Skunk Man Sam and Rob Clark on the
[SPEAKER_13]: aroma story here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We always wanted to define what skunk was,
like, for a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, what does the skunk smell?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we knew it wasn't a terp.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Rob and I wrote an article for
Cannabis Business Times in 2018,
[SPEAKER_13]: where we pointed out that we couldn't say
it was in cannabis because we don't have a
[SPEAKER_13]: lab, and we didn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we found the literature in hops.
[SPEAKER_13]: That thiols were in hops.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the skunky odor in beer that goes off
is a thiol.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we put that out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: But one of the points that was interesting
is it was also a thiol that was being
[SPEAKER_13]: created through photo decomposition.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was in the hops.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in the brew.
[SPEAKER_13]: But in green-bottled beer, like Heineken
and Becks and all these German imports,
[SPEAKER_13]: that gets photo decomposition,
and that creates even more thiols.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you crack that top and you smell that
skunky aroma, that's photo decomposition.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess to Alex's point is that it is
actually, possibly, not only is it in
[SPEAKER_13]: there, but it's also continuing to be
created in the plant itself in the cure
[SPEAKER_13]: over time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that was just interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And where I got that is when I moved to
Amsterdam in 1993, and the first time I
[SPEAKER_13]: opened up a brown-bottle Heineken,
and took a drink, I was like, this isn't
[SPEAKER_13]: Heineken.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a totally different beer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I found out that all Heineken
that goes export to the US goes in a green
[SPEAKER_13]: bottle, because it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And all Heineken domestically goes into a
brown bottle, because brown bottles block
[SPEAKER_13]: out the light that causes that skunky
odor.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the hop world had studied that and
researched it and knew all about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was kind of like a little inside
joke about the skunkiness in beer and how
[SPEAKER_13]: it was a green-bottle thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: The nose knows, and it's just constantly
changing is also the problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: All I was going to point out is the
structure of these things, some of you may
[SPEAKER_08]: be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_08]: These look like the precursors to the
terpene pathway that are getting dilated.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's enzymatic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's light.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's definitely an interesting whole
new arena in the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they're pre-nolated sulfides.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so obviously isoprene is the starting
material for that, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be with a phosphate on there.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's super interesting to think
about where does that sulfur come from?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because biological sulfur is something
that is an atom of economy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Mother Nature uses sulfur all the
time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in cysteine, methionine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was thinking, because if you look
at one of those compounds, if you could
[SPEAKER_12]: pull up those structures again,
Kevin, one of those compounds is actually
[SPEAKER_12]: a C5 thiol.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually optically active.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the previous set of structures.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of those structures is actually
optically active.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it could basically be, again,
some kind of cysteine or homocysteine kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of pathway.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, those aren't the ones,
neither.
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be from their more recent work.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, just going back to the overall
theme, though, is that is that between
[SPEAKER_12]: extraction and between analysis of
extracted product, we're getting pretty
[SPEAKER_12]: damn close, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're getting able to be able to
measure between the lines of what are in
[SPEAKER_12]: these products.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where it's like, I don't know,
Alec, if you participated with Josh
[SPEAKER_12]: Swider, that group down there that they've
had to basically help them in this lawsuit
[SPEAKER_12]: that's happening in California where I
forget what the name of the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_12]: but there's a group of dispensaries down
south that are basically have a class
[SPEAKER_12]: action lawsuit against hemp producers for
bringing hemp-derived THC and THCA
[SPEAKER_12]: products into the state of California.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're claiming of losing market share
and just not proper testing, residual
[SPEAKER_12]: solvents, you know, THC isomers that are
in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So in one way, in one way, testing is
really kind of like the bad news in the
[SPEAKER_12]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the bad news is that there's
unsporthy, you know, basically producers
[SPEAKER_12]: that are producing all kinds of shit
because people want to get fucking high.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't ever think it was the
intention of the United States Congress to
[SPEAKER_12]: sign the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe they were snookered on fiber and
seeds and oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were like you said, Alec,
you get the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were not thinking about drug variety,
cannabinoids, and they didn't even
[SPEAKER_12]: contemplate how to bring CBD to market
because CBD is the active ingredient of
[SPEAKER_12]: Epidiolex, which is an FDA approved drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just low-key legalized cannabis
and created two totally different
[SPEAKER_07]: regulating platforms, you know,
which is really fucked and needs to be
[SPEAKER_07]: buttoned up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but the, you know, I think it's
really interesting to see how close,
[SPEAKER_07]: like to your extraction point,
just how much kind of it went from,
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the correlation of the nail
and the little buckets, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of, and how much you see the sharp
like increase in quality, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: from like the black hash oil knife hits on
stoves to kind of the live resin or live
[SPEAKER_07]: rosin and, you know, getting to,
you know, the most preserved essence of
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant, you know, and how volatile a
lot of these compounds are, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, I have a lot of questions
around kind of, you know, the idea of like
[SPEAKER_07]: effect, you know, and how entourage and,
you know, kind of the uniqueness of
[SPEAKER_07]: different highs comes about, you know,
how much terpenes play a role and how much
[SPEAKER_07]: these very trace part per billion,
part per trillion level flavorant or
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatic agents kind of play a role.
[SPEAKER_07]: But either way, it's like when they're
gone, you know, it's like the further out
[SPEAKER_07]: the cannabiterp ratio goes, you know,
kind of, you know, whenever you,
[SPEAKER_07]: when it's most chronic and you got three
percent turps and you got 15 percent
[SPEAKER_07]: flower THC or 20 percent or 25 percent or
30 percent, you know, it's like a 10 to
[SPEAKER_07]: one or closer cannabiterp ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the presence of influence on
entourage effect is substantial.
[SPEAKER_07]: The preservation of these aromatics and
all these other trace volatiles,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, all kind of are, you know,
in their most present form, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: but when that is compromised and goes to a
hundred to one cannabiterp ratio like most
[SPEAKER_07]: of what is on dispensary shelves,
you know, in retail markets, especially
[SPEAKER_07]: retail markets where people have to gamma
irradiate and zap their turps just to be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to sell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like that's the herbal
distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like there's no, you know,
there's no turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's might as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, so so I think,
you know, kind of ended, sorry,
[SPEAKER_07]: a bunch of things I'm bringing up,
but like I think ultimately, yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: no, I totally just got lost in the sauce
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, yeah, I think I think for
folks to close this hemp loophole.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what's the thing that's the
biggest thing we need to do like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like the word industrial
hemp is such a misused word.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I think until we get to the crux
of that, you know, then we're not going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be able to differentiate or define,
you know, kind of because right now you
[SPEAKER_07]: have like hundreds, hundreds of liters of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sorry, CBD horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's all they are is CBD horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's I will say this about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had converted oils making the market,
cutting all the THC in the market and like
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just destroying the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And go ahead, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just going to say about the hemp
industrial hemp thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we got that going here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It must have been ninety four or ninety
five in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think commercial laws changed in ninety
eight, which is when you saw like the
[SPEAKER_11]: companies come out and start selling the
de-hulled seed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was really always a grain play in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: We never did like CBD cultivars to try and
but then again, we never had the market
[SPEAKER_11]: that you guys had.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I remember when CBD isolate
started getting produced in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_11]: my buddy was selling it for like sixty
thousand dollars a kilo.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's like six hundred dollars a
kilo now, which speaks three hundred.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so this speaks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look, he's got the balloons.
[SPEAKER_11]: This speaks to what Mojave was saying
earlier in regards to, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: having a regulatory body that's sort of
says like, hey, you know, and Fletch as
[SPEAKER_11]: well was also speaking to this about
saying, hey, listen, we control it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We tell people how much they can grow and
the price that they can sell it at and to
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of try and not implode the entire
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely saw that in the US CBD
industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I guess part of that implosion
was also the saving grace for them to
[SPEAKER_11]: convert and to create these other
cannabinoids that they can then sell at
[SPEAKER_11]: gas stations where people can get high of,
which is what this whole conversation has
[SPEAKER_11]: been about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wonder, you know, where it's going
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also would would would recognize the
fact that we are the anomaly, like we are
[SPEAKER_11]: the small percentage.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like most people probably don't care if
they're pre-rolled joints or have
[SPEAKER_11]: botanical turps and 20 different types of
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're smoking radioactive cigarettes and
actively enjoying alcohol as their
[SPEAKER_11]: favorite personal drug of choice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they're on like a bunch of
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they're on their ninth booster.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not judging.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all have to make our choices.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is just a strange thing to think.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always I always I always hear Debbie
Goldsberry, you know, from years ago when
[SPEAKER_11]: we were going off about how it's got to be
the best and we got to have the best turps
[SPEAKER_11]: and the this and the that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's like, she's like, guys,
I love your passion.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm telling you, like in 30 years of
doing this, people don't give a shit about
[SPEAKER_11]: anything other than price and THC
percentage.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it leads me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just gonna say that's the role of the
regulator to kind of ensure it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: poisoned.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody wants it like there's the
whole jewel generation of kids that are
[SPEAKER_07]: just puffing on those like those flavor
sticks, you know, that wants some
[SPEAKER_07]: butterscotch distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as it's not poisoned.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like when you look at like,
you know, a lot of botanically derived
[SPEAKER_07]: turps, they have like huge amounts of
benzene in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything with a cherry flavor,
anything with a cherry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's like, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would imagine almost all of those,
those botanical turps that I've ever
[SPEAKER_09]: touched have serious problems with all the
and a big reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the city because all the pesticides
super concentrate not only in the extract,
[SPEAKER_07]: but primarily in the essential oils,
you know, you're all experts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all experts here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, has anybody come across
anybody who's been able to come even close
[SPEAKER_04]: to replicating what the plant can actually
do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's another perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would go as far to say even the plant
itself has problems with toxicology when
[SPEAKER_09]: we extract it by itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by design, there's certain
constituents in certain levels that we
[SPEAKER_09]: shouldn't be ingesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and that's, that's another
problem, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the hemp world, for some reason,
that happens often.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not so often in type one,
but there's a lot of turpene extracted
[SPEAKER_09]: varietals that are meant for that,
that are being sold at scale that do have
[SPEAKER_09]: tox problems with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to just call that out that I've
learned over my time that it is on both
[SPEAKER_09]: sides and we all have to just be really
open about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The path forward is about recognizing,
Hey, maybe we shouldn't grow super,
[SPEAKER_09]: super haze and extract it for turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it has this type of, you know,
turpene in it that we can't have at 3% or
[SPEAKER_09]: more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's causing, you know, cell damage at
this rate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And therefore, from a tox perspective,
it's unfit for consumption, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're exactly right on the
toxicology of certain things being at
[SPEAKER_07]: certain concentrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: It like all of a sudden becomes really
gnarly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think, I mean, but if you grow
cannabis, hemp, type three cannabis on
[SPEAKER_07]: clean land, with clean water, clean
inputs, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: The turps are clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's clean, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think, you know, again,
it's like, I think cannabis has the
[SPEAKER_07]: potential to flip agriculture in the long
run, you know, in this becoming like a
[SPEAKER_07]: bought into it, like reality and issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, seen kind of as from the
cultural side of things, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: because you can't just flip a thousand
acre mega farm, you know, you can't just
[SPEAKER_07]: flip a greenhouse that's been kind of cut
flowers for the last 10 years,
[SPEAKER_07]: because guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're inheriting so many of the problems
of the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think, you know, again,
it's like if there can be this buttoned up
[SPEAKER_07]: loophole between hemp, what's called hemp
and cannabis, I think it's the greatest
[SPEAKER_07]: thing that could ever come for any buddy
closest to the plant that's in integrity
[SPEAKER_07]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think in the long run, those that
are in integrity with the plant are going
[SPEAKER_07]: to succeed, you know, and those that are
out of integrity of the plant are might be
[SPEAKER_07]: making some like short term gain and
profit, but are going to have a long term,
[SPEAKER_07]: not successful path with the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think what it takes, it'll correct
itself as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's important is that that
every, this is all just transition.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like, whether, whether it goes back to
just being state based license systems,
[SPEAKER_13]: and we have all these little islands or
whether it goes the farm bill path and
[SPEAKER_13]: they change the ruling on early harvest
window or whether they all the things that
[SPEAKER_13]: they're going to do, we know it's going to
go back and forth, but it will correct
[SPEAKER_13]: itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my hope, my hope is that in this,
all this turmoil, we're, we're forced to
[SPEAKER_13]: pick a path, which seems like what's
happening right now, because there's been
[SPEAKER_13]: a, a sea change in terms of, you know,
congressional support.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's, it's now every region has
cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone wants the money.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody wants it to go forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody knows somebody who's in the
business or uses it medicinally,
[SPEAKER_13]: or, you know, it's like, there's no,
anyway, we're past that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now it's just like, we're all just
waiting, like, you guys tell us which path
[SPEAKER_13]: to take.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what I thought the guy,
this grower, he's joined the three
[SPEAKER_13]: different angles was a really interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like, dude, and doing it well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, like, Hey, like,
I don't know which way it's going to go,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I got my, I got my over here and I got
it over here and over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And either way I'm like, we've all pivoted
many times and medical was a pivot.
[SPEAKER_13]: We all know medical was a pivot.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we wanted medical to happen,
but really we're just all trying to
[SPEAKER_13]: legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hemp laws in Canada were a pivot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything is a pivot.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all just trying to legalize big C
cannabis genus cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So to me, whichever way we get there,
you know, eventually it'll become some
[SPEAKER_13]: Australia is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_13]: Australia started out total medical,
like regulated, federally regulated,
[SPEAKER_13]: pharmaceutical thing, all cannabis
cultivars had to be called like a leave
[SPEAKER_13]: and refresh.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now they're just now every California
brand, all the cultivars, they want
[SPEAKER_13]: chronic, they want fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: They want all the, they want it just the
way everybody does.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though they call it medical,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_13]: In Australia now 4% of the population
holds a medical card.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to know, I'd like to know what
the butt is that Fletch held up just a few
[SPEAKER_11]: minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause that looked pretty fucking
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, it's basically Oishi,
which is Japanese for delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It skittles across a flavor pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like in the breeding line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Colin's probably seen that one
when I was back in New York.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: The, the stuff that you showed me and we
smoked on together, like, man,
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to get some packs of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: That stuff's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just lingered perfectly guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, every, everyone had a
different, slightly different profile,
[SPEAKER_09]: but ended up in the same place.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just lingered and just taste,
just flavor coding.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a question for you, Fletch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, why is it that you grow?
[SPEAKER_11]: And breed such incredible quality
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: What, what, what are you doing
differently?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it your olfactory?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it your ability to perceive volatile
organic compounds?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it something you're doing in the grow?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it that you have access to incredible
starter genetics?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I just, I've always known you've had
great genetics, but it's, it seems to be
[SPEAKER_11]: even like another level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's just like, you're just so
focused on the exceptional.
[SPEAKER_11]: What, how, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, I don't know if you guys have
seen how many joints have already rolled
[SPEAKER_02]: and smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that helps contribute to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, man, my passion is just,
I like hunting through populations and
[SPEAKER_02]: like giving all the different hybrids the
opportunity to, um, express whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, you know, with breeding for me,
it's like, everybody always thinks,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I'm going to cross this with this and
I'm going to get exactly what I imagined.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I'm more just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shotgun approach to see what hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think it's just enjoying that
and, uh, that being exciting that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that just, it doesn't matter what you even
start with necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to continue to improve what
you have through that process,
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as you continue to, you know,
reinvest in that process is really what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's just expensive to, to have bad
runs or whatever it is, um, or where you
[SPEAKER_02]: pick the wrong parent this time and you
need to go back and rework a line or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, just enjoying that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then part of it was just,
uh, always knowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started growing, at least just
having collected a really wide range of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the American clone only genetics and
making sure that I, that I knew what I had
[SPEAKER_02]: and why I had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, I only focused on
flavor, you know, and smell, but really
[SPEAKER_02]: things that only transferred to flavor or
it had an exceptional smell that I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to make into a good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's, you know, continually
been the process.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the other thing that I would add is
that your shit produces full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's also not something that always
translates.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's tons of cultivars out there that
are delicious and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love them as, you know, a vapor off
of the flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I try to turn them into hash,
it's just, the yields aren't there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if the yields are there, it's just not
translating the same way that what I
[SPEAKER_11]: perceived in the flower would be as a
concentrate out of the flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that that's sort of an,
uh, you know, they're, they're really full
[SPEAKER_11]: melt genetics, like full melt certified
genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of your genetics produce when grown
properly, obviously just beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even think a lot of that's just the
selection process too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and using multiple or even having
lines made from multiple different females
[SPEAKER_02]: and just making more selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lots of people, um, grow my seeds
out and find great selections too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's awesome having,
you know, high end growers grow what we
[SPEAKER_02]: make and, and, uh, and get them to perform
really well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to comment on even the,
the secondary line that you released that
[SPEAKER_09]: were just like stuff you didn't really
test all that much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we got a dose C times original diesel
on dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw, we found some four heaters in
there and there was only six seeds in the
[SPEAKER_09]: pack, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can only take so much credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the original diesel was,
you know, just making sure I have the
[SPEAKER_02]: original legitimate clone and held it for
20 years and then crossing it with a good
[SPEAKER_02]: selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and, and it, you know,
it wasn't even the dose C 18 wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily like my favorite dosey dough
plant for my flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, for that, it was just the most
resinous, um, you know, highest hash
[SPEAKER_02]: yielding, um, you know, type from that
original like 30 seeds I popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's not even like, it was a big,
big hunt or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just the continual process of just
picking something better every time and
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward is that's the name of the
game to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not every like everybody thinks that,
Oh, I'm just going to back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, all you're doing is
doubling up, tripling up on the original
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that you were trying to improve by
going back to the plant that has all the
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, it's, it's about making the
selections and then moving, moving forward
[SPEAKER_02]: with, uh, with those and trying to
increase the reoccurrence of the traits
[SPEAKER_02]: that you do want.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's rad.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think skunk man Sam just popped into the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a day late and a dollar short again.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're still here, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like three hours later, we're still here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was really surprised to see you still
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you came in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: When Fletch was talking about like
selection and breeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought that that was very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, me, I always liked to grow
out as many as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred is nothing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done grow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's been no hunting from 20,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had the privilege.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go through about a thousand to 2000 a
year indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, no, it was 20,000 skunk number
ones, half male, half female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I selected the 10 best boys and the 10
best girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and those have spawned probably half
of the best hash making varieties in the
[SPEAKER_02]: last 40 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations skunk man Sam on the,
uh, emerald cup recognition and award
[SPEAKER_07]: tube.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dude, for real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hoping to be able to see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm so worthy, I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you mention what his award was
there, Alec?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to remember off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was lifetime achievement kind
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it was into the Beezer's Hall of
Fame.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your service to humanity
into the flavor of the ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the biggest thing that I
did, to be honest, was I sold seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why those genetics are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if we don't know it's in something,
it's a high probability that it
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially is in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, between haze and skunk was the two
that was used the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: The California orange and Durbin poison
were also used really a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some early Thai that was used
really a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a variety called bunk, which was
Thai haze, skunk, which was really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Foundation of most of what's out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use that to read my lemon cake.
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the backbone of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I selected lemon leaner and just get that
back to another skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried really hard to get varieties that
were extremely high in terpenes and really
[SPEAKER_01]: loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I personally enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like dry sifting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And water has because it's kept a little
bit more of the terpenes and some
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties are very sensitive to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other ones just ignore it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turb water from the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want turp water.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you want is you want turps in the
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the perfect group to ask in terms
of why certain resin heads wash and some
[SPEAKER_02]: don't just because you brought it up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is the perfect group to
ask is that this is how I, my assumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all like made plenty of
rosin, BHO, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that, some of those residents,
even if you put them in a freezer,
[SPEAKER_02]: they won't harden up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they just, there's too much,
too much terping sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too much terping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if it won't, if it won't freeze,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it won't freeze at, let's say,
you know, uh, 32 degrees or even a freezer
[SPEAKER_02]: that's seven or negative seven or
whatever, then in, in the hash is
[SPEAKER_02]: basically just the representation of the
trichome heads ratio of th or cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to other compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, if it's too terpy,
like, like you just said, skunk man,
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, it won't freeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't freeze at 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore you can't wash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll, the heads will just burst in the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think that they burst as much
as some of them seem to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turps are water soluble from the
heads.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could tell really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the water is terpy, then, you know,
there were varieties that we did like shit
[SPEAKER_01]: raw, uh, water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the water wouldn't spill very strong
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, most of the flavors and the taste
was the same, whether you dry sifted or
[SPEAKER_01]: water hashed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the terpenes are water soluble,
the terpenes were like inside the head,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it should be, it's not burst,
but it's, it's leaked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's innards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's ruptured.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't catch the trichome head anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's also one of the reasons I
like dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I would make dry sift,
I would cure it for three or four months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was more like a little raisin than a
fresh head because the fresh head smeared
[SPEAKER_01]: easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, uh, you know, when you're trying to
dry sift it, uh, you don't want it
[SPEAKER_01]: smearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it, you know, dry system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are varieties like, in fact,
one of the best dry sift varieties I ever
[SPEAKER_02]: had, which this was the pictures,
uh, uh, Marcus that you remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Shroomy420 posted those full melt
photos on your forum back in the day that
[SPEAKER_02]: came from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyways, the, the, that was a skunk
number one times white rhino, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, you're, you know,
skunk number one is one of my favorite for
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the most incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I popped those seeds in 2004,
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, that was, I mean,
it was skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I've always seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cured that weed, was it,
uh, uh, easier to dry sift?
[SPEAKER_02]: It would literally start dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with, if I just dried, if,
you know, 10 day hang, let the room get to
[SPEAKER_02]: like 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: Percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would just rain Keith when you trim
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw this trim on top of a silkscreen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always have done too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read all your guys' books.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I took it all in the practice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Zameer Punjab did a thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I actually can med and it's in my,
my cross microscopy or whatever,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, on cannabis heads on trichomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he shows some ripe heads and the
secreting and actually coating the outer
[SPEAKER_13]: layer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's kind of far out because it's not
burst at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a fully intact head, but just it's
slowly oozing out and it's covering.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's always one thing that I've always
wondered is like, what makes fresh
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis sticky?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's like, how does that head so
sticky when the chemistry hasn't happened
[SPEAKER_13]: until it ruptures.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the reality is it's happening on a
ripe head on the inside and on the
[SPEAKER_13]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has a lot to do with,
you know, is it going through the rock
[SPEAKER_01]: shell or is it coming out?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you'll have to, I don't want to
say it because I have such a poor memory,
[SPEAKER_13]: but check it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's, it's really good image.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually sat in and I didn't even see it
when I sat in on the conference,
[SPEAKER_13]: but he's basically showing fully intact,
ripe heads that are slowly oozing out and
[SPEAKER_13]: coating the outside surface, but it's
still ripe.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other, the other source that's
really interesting right now is this,
[SPEAKER_13]: that photographer, um, zoom gardens and
he's peeling, he's peeling the cuticle
[SPEAKER_13]: layer off of the gland head.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's far out because sometimes it
stays intact as the layer comes off.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, because all the,
the, the gland is this hard structure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's, it's not as much of a water
balloon as people assume that you just
[SPEAKER_13]: poke it and it oozes out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it oozes out very slowly and
gradually.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it's rough.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure, but still intact.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like that freezing and that dry setting
still works to get it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the terpene ratio that's
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how much in the tent and the
temperature that you're at, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's like super terpy, it'll,
it'll be gelatinous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's like a really low terpene,
you know, terpene, I mean, just all of
[SPEAKER_02]: those types of compounds, uh, particularly
in my imagination, it'd be like alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: type compounds, just like liquor doesn't
freeze in your freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So THC it's hard at like 60 or 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more terps you add, the lower the
freezing point gets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's down to varietal and
what's there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're saying like of what that a
hundred percent of what class of chemical
[SPEAKER_09]: constituents are there, let's say it's
high in terpenine or high in beta-carotene
[SPEAKER_09]: or whatever, whatever that might be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that spread, what you're talking
about Fletcher, I think it's sometimes
[SPEAKER_09]: inside of that, that wax cuticle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and sometimes it's some of the
constituents are actually on the outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're, you're.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's on the outside and it washes,
but the head still stays intact,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll get half from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just wash them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's literally nothing in the back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and that's something I wanted to
real quick jump in on, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I really appreciate you bringing that
up Fletcher, um, bigger respect to archive
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's really awesome to kind of,
you know, and skunk man Sam joining kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of this pretty legendary, but,
um, it's very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause if you look at what washes typically
the things that wash best or carotene,
[SPEAKER_07]: limonene, they're in that dessert zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the highest yields and dumps as
opposed to trying to wash terpenine
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't wash trying to wash like awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, or like, I mean, all the terpenes
will have different freezing points,
[SPEAKER_02]: some lower and some higher and then
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus that cannabinoid types and those
freezing points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I mean, that's what makes
sense to me in terms of the main factor
[SPEAKER_02]: that makes stuff wash or extractable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also of course, temperature
dependent, like I think you could get the
[SPEAKER_02]: water colder theoretically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides the freezing point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also different terpenes have
different solubility in water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydrophobic hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's cause that's a, you know,
because in, in that topic, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what happens to the THC, those ones
that you watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, real quick, real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, just to, you know, cause it just
wanted to make a, make a point on,
[SPEAKER_07]: on, um, what we've seen with testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So certain, you know, terpenine you wash,
you, you BHO that it's the most high dump,
[SPEAKER_07]: like awesome, like high terp, you know,
so I think there's the right type of
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction for right type of terp,
you know, certain things that don't wash
[SPEAKER_07]: like Sam saying dry sea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, kind of things that you,
you know, unable to do otherwise,
[SPEAKER_07]: unless you do something like butane
extract, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get the residual out and super
bomb, you know, um, but the, but what do
[SPEAKER_07]: I, what I want to hit on too is like,
what is within the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest thing we've learned about
potency and variants from top middle to
[SPEAKER_07]: bottom has less to do with kind of,
uh, you know, bouncing around the lab lab
[SPEAKER_07]: and has more to do with, uh, optimal
canopy management processes and lead
[SPEAKER_07]: removing leaf at the right time is
critical through the development of
[SPEAKER_07]: flowers and the maturing of flowers and
people that like strip and remove such a
[SPEAKER_07]: vast, you know, which is very contrary to
a lot of the old school belief,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you know, like removing 75% of family
right at the start of flower, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: keeping that off on day 21, keeping that
off in day 56.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what happens is every bud doesn't get
any difference in light and all mature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of at the same rate was about a top
bud tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever a top bud tests, if you have
this like optimal canopy management
[SPEAKER_07]: process, removing all of the leaf at the
right times and keeping it off,
[SPEAKER_07]: then all the buds kind of mature at that
rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And overall, not only do we see the
standardization of cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_07]: across the plant to what a top bud tests
plus or minus like a 5% relative
[SPEAKER_07]: difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so if you had like a 25 up top plus or
minus like one and a half percent or 1.7%
[SPEAKER_07]: or whatever that is, so you could have
kind of this standardization for when a
[SPEAKER_07]: compliance test happens and a
representative sampling, you're like right
[SPEAKER_07]: at the number of what a top of test,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you remove, like a lot of farmers
remove way too much leaf, way too late in
[SPEAKER_07]: the flower and those are all immature
developed buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's, you could have on the same
plant, you know, the 25 up here,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like 12 or so down here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now the average is like 18,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think part of it, you know,
cause when we've done this trial
[SPEAKER_07]: repeatedly across cultivars and time with
different farmers, you know, we've not
[SPEAKER_07]: only been able to show not only can you
standardize what the canopy test to what a
[SPEAKER_07]: top bud test and the genetic bring out the
genetic full potential of the plant and
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids and terps and other
aromatics, but, um, that you get a yield,
[SPEAKER_07]: increased yield per plant, increased
extraction efficiency of what you're able
[SPEAKER_07]: to pull off that material per plant,
you know, cause, cause I think it's about
[SPEAKER_07]: optimization of how it's cultivated for if
it's going to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then further it's about what is
the extract, what is the appropriate
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction process for it to be put
through so you can even turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So dude, you're, you're touching on things
that I think is, are, are a must,
[SPEAKER_09]: must have topic because it's, it's the
most important thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think any of the individuals that are
listening that are hash makers in the chat
[SPEAKER_09]: right now, if you're an actual hash maker,
what Alec was touching on with your
[SPEAKER_09]: defoliation and your SOPs that go back to
your cultivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_09]: If, you know, if you've listened to any of
the things that I've ever said,
[SPEAKER_09]: any of the the, the, the talks I've done,
it only starts with defoliation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a reason why everything that
Alex just said, that is going to
[SPEAKER_09]: exponentially help your resin quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get in there early enough and have
a really finite timing in which you do
[SPEAKER_09]: that and where you do that on the plant at
what time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll leave you to design that for
yourselves, but that is the most that I've
[SPEAKER_09]: learned over my time doing this from
cultivation to oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's, there's a lot that goes into
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just about being a great
extractor.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about being a great steward of that
plant from that seed to oil and
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding all of the ways that you
need to do the things you need to do in
[SPEAKER_09]: your SOPs and work instructions as a team.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it's not singular, especially when
you're doing things at scale.
[SPEAKER_09]: It all has to work in harmony and that's a
very difficult task.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's dude, you just,
you hit on all kinds of things that I,
[SPEAKER_09]: that I really think about on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it's not just one part of the
process that makes it great.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all these things that amount to where
you end up and I think totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, and you know, and, and,
you know, cause I think testing has helped
[SPEAKER_07]: me in the huge way to realize so much of
what the passion people have for the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: and for extraction have helped them to
learn already, you know, and, and I think
[SPEAKER_07]: they compliment in an incredibly big way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and I think a big part of this too
is, you know, diversity, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because can, cannabis has become
homogenized in the chase for THC strains
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as in the chase for strains that
wash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we now see in this California state
fair in the Emerald cup, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: 60, 80% of any given category or more in
the solventless category are all the same
[SPEAKER_07]: profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very slight variations of the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the only thing that people really
enter that are different or quote unquote
[SPEAKER_07]: exotic have some unique Esther or Terp or
something in there like the tropical kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of sulfur Terps to make like mimosas smell
unique, which is why people are like,
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's exotic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not exotic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually abundant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and then Sam helped bring that to the
world, you know, but the thing is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is, uh, it's about like diverse cultivars
covering the range of what's possible and
[SPEAKER_07]: then finding and fine tuning both the
pruning, canopy management process,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as what is the ideal extraction
process to make that most awesome
[SPEAKER_07]: representation of that cultivar through
hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Question for you now, do you think that's
due to, and this is no shade on clone
[SPEAKER_09]: houses that are actually doing commercial
cloning, not guys that are selling clones
[SPEAKER_09]: online.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that's problematic within
that system that we've developed that you
[SPEAKER_09]: buy from a clone house, they just have a
menu for that season.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all you get your pigeonholed into
buying whatever a kush cake or whatever
[SPEAKER_09]: skittles they're growing at large or blue
drain, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what do you, you know, how do we,
cause you know, it's, it's, let's be
[SPEAKER_09]: honest at scale, um, owning moms and
propagation is a very expensive and it's,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's probably the most expensive aspect
of, of doing all this to get yourself set
[SPEAKER_09]: up to grow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I wonder, you know, I keep thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you know, hunts are tough when
you're dealing with dollars and cents and
[SPEAKER_09]: people that are, don't truly own their
businesses, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're, they're really just taking money
from people and they're working for a VC
[SPEAKER_09]: or a bunch of people that have funded it
and they're like, they're just,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're stuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to grow this that they know
sells.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do we break that mold too?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, cause that's something we talk
about in our team is like, we don't want
[SPEAKER_09]: to be stuck, like caught in that ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Rob said, Rob said at the interval
cup years ago, I got quoted by LA times,
[SPEAKER_13]: which, which was seeds are life and clones
are death.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was talking about bottlenecking of
the genome, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Of the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know of a particular industry,
which I won't mention, but in California,
[SPEAKER_13]: over 50%, of their sales over 50% last
year were gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now at least that one's got a little gas
on it, you know, 50% of the entire sales
[SPEAKER_13]: and these guys are selling all over the
States and everywhere, but we're cutting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the big bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, that's a sign of the fast food
era that we're in right now, where
[SPEAKER_13]: everyone's just like cheap and easy and
what sells and what's colorful and what's
[SPEAKER_07]: also a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think is actually what's funny is I
think, cause you know, what we've seen is
[SPEAKER_07]: this continuous homogenization of Cal of
flavors in California to only be like 60
[SPEAKER_07]: to 80% of what's back.
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me of back in the day,
like in LA, 48 or 50 strains on a shelf
[SPEAKER_07]: would be OG Kush variations, you know,
and there was like no difference,
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that blew out and then kind of now the
rise of the desserts, but now it's the
[SPEAKER_07]: same thing, you know, and what's a trip of
what I'm seeing is so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that the bulk buying market is
very disconnected with the consumer
[SPEAKER_07]: demand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the bulk buying market largely
isn't trying to curtail to the unique
[SPEAKER_07]: consumer demand in any given state.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like playing to the traditional
market, you know, and so you got 60 to 80%
[SPEAKER_07]: of herb in California desserts and that's
not slowing down, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, even though Terpenelein right
strains like that Sage, like that train
[SPEAKER_07]: wreck, you know, they represent like less
than 10% of what's on dispensary shelves,
[SPEAKER_07]: but BDS analytics and Leafly data have
shown in various regions of a state and
[SPEAKER_07]: various counties across the nation.
[SPEAKER_07]: When Terpenelein varieties are around,
they move like five to eight times as
[SPEAKER_07]: quick as anything else on the shelf till
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's a different value.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and I think like ultimately the idea
of like, you know, because I think every
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivator has to make those types of
choices, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to grow nothing but Skittles
and Gelato by Skittles Gelato crosses,
[SPEAKER_07]: even though 80% of the markets that you
know, because unless your herb is like
[SPEAKER_07]: twice as turped and preserved as
everything else, you just blend in with
[SPEAKER_07]: the mass of everything else, you know,
but by diversifying your portfolio,
[SPEAKER_07]: having all these other cultivators.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might grow Gelato 41, 50% or more of
what you bulk grow, but as long as you
[SPEAKER_07]: have those like really epic isolated,
you know, is that you love that cover,
[SPEAKER_07]: like range of smell and flavor,
you know, you can always grow those in
[SPEAKER_07]: smaller amounts, keep them going and find
the niche markets and areas and where
[SPEAKER_07]: you're at to be able to really start
building a grassroots demand for those,
[SPEAKER_07]: because you know, what we're seeing when
people do that, it's like a leap of faith,
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's like you're making huge
choices, you know, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: don't not grow it, just grow way less of
it until you can start justifying that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or the other thing, the other
thing that can be done is people can
[SPEAKER_01]: cyrogenically freeze, cryogenically freeze
and clones and keep them forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we're going to find like in
the future market when everywhere has
[SPEAKER_02]: legal grows, and there's just,
you know, it's available everywhere is if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not innovating your product with
your products, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: commoditized or pushed into that market
because you and everybody else that bought
[SPEAKER_02]: the same clones this year are all in the
market together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter how new they are,
you bring back something from three years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, it won't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more commercialized growers are
playing that game and buying from those
[SPEAKER_02]: places and not finding something unique to
their business, the quicker it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to be honest, what I made a lot of
seeds in my life, but the seeds I made
[SPEAKER_01]: were, I tried to think of other people,
but really they were the seeds I liked.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you have a distinct palate,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we each do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what's so cool about this
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like it tickles our
olfactory senses in a way that I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: some people can eat cilantro because it's
soapy or don't like chocolate or cacao
[SPEAKER_07]: because of the bitterness, you know,
and others love it, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_07]: where, you know, I think it's really
about, you know, what we've been working
[SPEAKER_07]: with the Emerald Cup and the State Fair on
and really progressive dispensaries in the
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like when you present herb to
consumers, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you have 80% of what's on your shelf?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this one thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're not really providing a
difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And are all the turps gone?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like sorting, like kind of
presenting it, like when you go,
[SPEAKER_07]: because when you go into a wine store or
an alcohol store, right, like that every
[SPEAKER_07]: cashier isn't a sommelier, nor should they
be expected to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot to ask.
[SPEAKER_07]: But whenever the average consumer goes in,
you got your Merlot's and Merlot's
[SPEAKER_07]: Chardonnay's, Chardonnay's, Cabernet's,
Cabernet's, Rosé's, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the average person can make a
choice based on what they know their
[SPEAKER_07]: flavor preference is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And presenting it in such a way not only
kind of helps to kind of really get deeper
[SPEAKER_07]: into like helping people find what best,
you know, associates with their
[SPEAKER_07]: endocannabinoid system, but it also shows
where you're lacking, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and and helps to reestablish value.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, hey, dude, if I've got
unlimited access to Gelato 41 and Kush
[SPEAKER_07]: cake, but I don't have any plugs that have
anything in the awesome endowment,
[SPEAKER_07]: like tropical sleigh ride or pineapple
tie, pineapple, anything for kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: turpentine, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, sweet tooth, like,
you know, I mean, I think kind of the more
[SPEAKER_07]: and there are so much of it happens at the
retail, because I think the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation around turps and preservation
of turps is like almost preaching to the
[SPEAKER_07]: choir for those closest to the plant,
you know, because THC is better,
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But once you get to like the average
purchaser dispensary, that's buying off
[SPEAKER_07]: spreadsheets and strain names,
with THC percentages often blown out
[SPEAKER_07]: inflated and not even real, it
commoditizes it, right brings it to a
[SPEAKER_07]: point where it doesn't even it doesn't
mean anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it it blends biomass versus the most
crap, chronic herb in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the consumer level, because and
because the end awareness and I'm sorry to
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wrapping the point, but the
awareness is in the epiphany around this
[SPEAKER_07]: turps matter, aromatics are the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're there or not, you know,
that's not going to come from an epiphany
[SPEAKER_07]: at the average consumer level or the
average buyer dispensary that's buying off
[SPEAKER_07]: spreadsheets is going to come from the top
thought leaders in the space helping to
[SPEAKER_07]: disseminate that out, you know,
and leading by example, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when is somebody going to test if files
can contribute and modulate THC the way
[SPEAKER_01]: turfing genes do because files the latest
craze, but nobody knows that they
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially or modulate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has guesses, but nobody's proven
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or indulge.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's the one I've been chasing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indulge pretty exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and Sam, actually, I brought
this up earlier, but I'd love your kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: thoughts on it and your observations,
especially since the orange that you had
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as the skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because when it comes to these
trace tiles and sulfuric compounds like
[SPEAKER_07]: tropical sulfur that makes that tangy,
you know, orange citrus vibe and then the
[SPEAKER_07]: tiles that make the gas vibe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the nose can pick them up at such
levels that push the capabilities,
[SPEAKER_07]: even the most sophisticated analytical
chemistry equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when whenever you go to concentrate it
and they're in the biggest amounts,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they can be, you know,
at that point, you know, they're there,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, where we've been working on
methods to develop, see what of them are
[SPEAKER_07]: even possibly to be tested for in flour
versus kind of what can be shown up and
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrated in extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's also where the human nose takes
it to a whole nother level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the marriage between science
and the human olfactory triple mass
[SPEAKER_07]: spectrometer, I think, is where kind of
this all really is where it kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: evolves to help celebrate the nuances.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in the in the Emerald Cup,
we we just launched a new category and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's the citrus category.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because there are so many examples
entered that people were entering as
[SPEAKER_07]: exotic, but were there were as numerous as
gas in the whole competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they spanned across terpene categories
from the Mircein category to the carofle
[SPEAKER_07]: and limonene category to the turpinoline
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were breeding for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found was and this blue Rob Clark
and mine mines because we cross Hayes with
[SPEAKER_01]: a hemp variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made grew up the F2s and made a
selection and we found one that smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly like Hayes, but it had no THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know how much you do not like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That really fucks with your nose.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Alec, like with all that you just
said, imagine owning that wine shop and
[SPEAKER_09]: selling like the most rare grapes in the
world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then having this little tiny section
on the right that's just like Everclear
[SPEAKER_09]: and some other weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And your customers come in and they're
like, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're like, well, I got all this
amazing stuff and all these really amazing
[SPEAKER_09]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I've got this stuff over here
that's 99 proof.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, well, I'll take that stuff
over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 99 proof.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 200 proof, 200 proof or whatever,
whatever the proof is.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it feels like that's kind of where
things have landed in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I correct me if I'm wrong,
anyone, but it just seems like that
[SPEAKER_09]: analogy feels real right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you said, Alec, we can only all as
a community talk about how that's
[SPEAKER_09]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do need to change it because there
is more to all of this than just a
[SPEAKER_09]: monomolecular substance.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those that are on here disagree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to spark that conversation
with everybody here is like, is that
[SPEAKER_09]: really the path?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, because there is many paths to
therapeutics here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes a monomolecular compound is
right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, too, some people want the most
punch they can get for their back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think that it's THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, for example, my best skunk clone was
only 17% THC, but it was super rich in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right terpings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like three to one term ratio, 5% terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people preferred it over stuff that
was 22 and 25 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we haven't proven, we haven't shown
what potency is with cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a big issue, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all, we all, we like potent
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: We all like to get high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but we don't know what potency is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even in the literature, we use the
attached THC to potency.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like, we all know that that's not,
no one was measuring THC in land race
[SPEAKER_13]: populations when they're selecting for
potency for a thousand years, they're
[SPEAKER_13]: selecting for potency.
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But the market, you know, and they want to
pay for their, they want, that's what they
[SPEAKER_13]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to get the biggest bang for
their buck.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we, we know that we can deliver a more
potent variety that's at a lower THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's, that's just about us being
bold.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Alex said, brands have to be bold.
[SPEAKER_13]: Breeders have to be bold.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to put the product on the shelf
for them to choose from.
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, the market's been
dumbed down so much that they just choose
[SPEAKER_13]: dessert flavors.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I think we should do, Alec is take
all the hazes, the sages, the train
[SPEAKER_13]: wrecks, the Jacks, the Durban's and
renewing them all fruity, flowery names.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we could try and do is educate the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the, that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben, you were going to say something,
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it just, thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just seems like it's kind of confusion on
both ends.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I hear that, where you have like a
high end bottle of wine and, and then you
[SPEAKER_14]: have like the low end alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of confused on the shelf
already or in the same in that at the
[SPEAKER_14]: store, but then confusion on the customer,
on the clientele end too, or if they're
[SPEAKER_14]: coming into that store, you know,
not sure where that begins or how to,
[SPEAKER_14]: where that would crack.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd almost go back to Sam or someone in
Amsterdam right now, where checking in to
[SPEAKER_14]: see if there, if there are any like really
high end or organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: organic, regenerative, even soil grown,
you know, as the basis for, for high end
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis or hash in Amsterdam as,
you know, like a, are there places where
[SPEAKER_14]: you could find any of that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I haven't heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you have to find it by word of
mouth, but it's, it can be done,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a minority of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always threw my plants organically in
the soil, in the ground, in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have grown it outdoors in
California, but you can't do it outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just don't work well in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember who said it earlier,
but you were talking about with with the
[SPEAKER_02]: market difference between or the demands
of the traditional market versus what the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual recreational consumer is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that drives a lot of what people grow
in terms of like the, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just in that conversation of, of what
strains people are choosing to grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: why the market is like candy heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because most rep grows big,
big ones, especially are having a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: time moving all their stuff through rec
shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're still trying to manage,
all right, we're going to plant 80% runs
[SPEAKER_02]: and then 20%, a couple sativas and some
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it sells on, they don't even put
any energy into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually growing more than the
market really demands of them for that
[SPEAKER_02]: product anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So between those markets and then,
and then businesses trying to fill both at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and it's keeping us in the stone age
because in any state, where this is the
[SPEAKER_07]: catering to the East Coast demand,
which is usually like a five year ago
[SPEAKER_07]: trend in like California or another state,
you know, it's kind of leading to where
[SPEAKER_07]: that's all you can grow because that's all
that bulk of buyers want to sell.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I think that's where just like
the, you know, the leap of faith exists,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, for people that are in the rec
market to kind of, again, find the right
[SPEAKER_07]: ratios of what you're growing,
but, but don't give up and like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, don't, if you can't beat them,
join them, but not when it comes to
[SPEAKER_07]: growing, nothing but that, because it's
like, that's going to be the collapse in
[SPEAKER_07]: the colonization of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, but then they have to invest in
breeding and finding their own shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, isolating, finding your right,
finding the phenos that cover the range.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the people, like I was mentioning
earlier, like in Oregon and California
[SPEAKER_07]: that are selling out quicker than is
trimmed to the highest price, the market
[SPEAKER_07]: can bear in the deepest floods.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they've started to be able to
kind of create markets for these rare,
[SPEAKER_07]: unique cultivars because of how much they
invested in terp preservation
[SPEAKER_07]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And treating cannabis like cabbage and
ensuring that they can deliver to the
[SPEAKER_07]: point of sale at a retail shelf herb that
is hundreds of percents more flavorful,
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatic, sticky than anything else on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, those that do that, like there
comes a point when a market, cause every
[SPEAKER_07]: happens in every market, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this overproduction that leads to
price compression that leads to potency
[SPEAKER_07]: inflation and fraudulent lab practices
that blows out the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the consumers at some point lose
faith in the entire system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just bouncing from brand to
brand with no loyalty because everything
[SPEAKER_07]: has a 40% flower result and tastes like
hay, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what happens is whenever that
happens in a market and the consumer loses
[SPEAKER_07]: faith and there's no loyalty, those that
double down on terp preservation that have
[SPEAKER_07]: a diverse array of profiles, all of a
sudden through the dispensary market,
[SPEAKER_07]: when they're delivering like this,
they're like the savior, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And like all of a sudden they build these
relations where they're selling out
[SPEAKER_07]: quicker than the trim, the highest price.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of them are getting cash on
delivery because of how chronic their herb
[SPEAKER_07]: is and how high their consumer demand and
loyalty for that brand is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like I know guys that only grow
three varietals, just won't change because
[SPEAKER_09]: they know it sells, it's already sold
before it's down, cured.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's three of the most popular
varietals in the game.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're just like, I can't dirt
deviate because I can't risk it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too risky to risk the fact that I
might have a bad batch when everything is
[SPEAKER_09]: just sold, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's another problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think there's also that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think looking at markets like Oregon and
Washington that are just super mature at
[SPEAKER_02]: this point, and there's not California,
Oklahoma, all these other states have
[SPEAKER_02]: taken over the like bulk game,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's grows here aren't really trying
to cater to that for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's, I mean, there's still
some people, but it's less so than
[SPEAKER_02]: probably anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think, I think you're right
Alec that the companies that focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: preserving the product to the consumer,
just like you would a gallon of milk is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, but it's really hard to do that
because most of the retail stores have no
[SPEAKER_02]: idea what they're doing with their product
and aren't willing to do it, which is why
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been vertically integrated for the
last like seven or eight years in Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: is because there was no other way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was, I'm from Washington and
we couldn't vertically integrate here
[SPEAKER_02]: legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't do it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it was like, there's no point for me
to, I'm going to be end up in a
[SPEAKER_02]: commoditized market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can't control the presentation in the
supply and demand of my own product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's turned out well for us,
but you have, but you have to gauge and
[SPEAKER_02]: size your market and your demand and your
supply correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just be like, Oh, do as much as
I like, because you're still, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: remember you're focusing on some
satisfying your local consumer at the end
[SPEAKER_02]: of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about all these other people
everywhere else that are coming into buy
[SPEAKER_02]: packs and all this other shit,
which is where I'd say still 80% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: legal, most legal markets are still at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and then you look at Oregon and
you can't really grow the like known
[SPEAKER_02]: clones for that long before it's that
strains commoditized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most growers in Oregon are popping
their own seeds, finding their own stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: making their own hybrids, making little
deals with other breeders to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's becoming more and more
commonplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are those same brands that are
selling their product out and,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but they're not 500 lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're 50 lights for a guy with,
you know, a 50 lighter in his backyard,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it used to be, but selling it all
legally at 3000 a pound is a great
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, I think looking at markets like
Oregon and Washington, and even Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of at this point, those big models
aren't even working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with export, even with export
available to these big operations in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not enough demand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like the plant is that certain,
certain fundamental level on
[SPEAKER_07]: corporatizable in this way of scaling,
commoditizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's own roadblocks with trying to
do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: The big companies have, have definitely
like stopped trying to produce millions of
[SPEAKER_11]: millions of feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just not a reality for them right
now, but there are some larger outdoor
[SPEAKER_11]: bros.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like my friend Merlin, who was here with
me earlier, he invited me to go see one in
[SPEAKER_11]: October.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's 94 acres, which is big.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a big grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's producing a fair amount of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been in a 77 acre one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a friend who has close to 200 acres
here in BC.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there's much more, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they're, I can't imagine
there's Canadians are buying all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the end with export, even it gets
pretty strict and there's most of like,
[SPEAKER_11]: if it's European, it's gotta be EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's Australia, you can have some other
regulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's definitely trying to get their
cannabis from Canada into those markets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause Canada doesn't have as much of a
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a small market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't they destroy and just get full value
over insurance up there because of the
[SPEAKER_09]: structure?
No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that they were allowed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other crops have crop insurance,
but I don't know about who's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: insure cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is some crop insurance, but I think
that like right away that was probably
[SPEAKER_10]: abused or abused up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, it's like when we signed up
with Leiden, there's so many insurance
[SPEAKER_10]: policies that we did for shipping and
they'd be like, after our very first
[SPEAKER_10]: claim, they cut us off.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the point?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's crazy about crop insurance is
it's like, cause farmers in agriculture
[SPEAKER_07]: required to create crop insurance,
not for if their crop is fucked and lost
[SPEAKER_07]: cause their practices, but in case they
get sued and held liable because they're
[SPEAKER_07]: spraying and overspray affects another
farm, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So on that end with crop insurance and
agriculture, that's on the high,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's on the rise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And premiums are on the rise because
cannabis farmers and how valuable the crop
[SPEAKER_07]: is whenever they get drifted on there's
hell to pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the government will pay you to not
grow in regular agriculture, at least
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's the truth, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the couple of things Alex,
you said, you know, really resonated with
[SPEAKER_09]: like, what is too much?
[SPEAKER_09]: And same with you, you know, Fletch,
like what is too much?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what is the canopy size that
makes it make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody with population, you just do
it with population, consumer base,
[SPEAKER_02]: X percentage smoke, this amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the amount of square foot,
not lights, not anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how many square feet we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people do we think are going to
try to be in this business?
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,000 people break the square footage down
to the square, to the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody starts there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can grow, if you can sell your shit
out, you can get more licensing and more
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing and keep growing your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Massachusetts has a path like that
for the 5,000 square foot micro business
[SPEAKER_09]: where you can resubmit if you're,
you know, if you need more.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's an awfully corporate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also keeps corporate investment out
because the first stage will be such a low
[SPEAKER_02]: bar that it won't have millions and
millions and millions of dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_02]: returns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to be a small
business until you show that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: successful and you're not flooding the
market with cheap bullshit that's tainted
[SPEAKER_02]: with pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And full of mold that doesn't test,
you know, it's just like that's your full
[SPEAKER_02]: of mycotoxins that have been remediated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all of that is just part of the
commercialization of it instead of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Affecting some sort of production control,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all about what method that's
easier than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it's the best method,
but it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's about, to me, it's about what
piece of pie is the regional model as we
[SPEAKER_13]: are in this transitional period.
[SPEAKER_13]: So everyone wants a slice of the pie,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're creating all these different
regional models and regional regulations
[SPEAKER_13]: for everyone to figure out who can
participate on investment.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much canopy can this corporation own?
[SPEAKER_13]: All that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are all temporary adjustments based
off of the current state of affairs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, to me, is the biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where all the investors like I get
more people asking me about like,
[SPEAKER_13]: so what do you guys in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: going to do about the farm bill?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, we're not ready to invest here
because you haven't figured out farm bill
[SPEAKER_13]: hemp in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, well, like, it's nuts,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So everyone knows it's headed towards an
international commodity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody knows that the guys that are
planting those acreage in Canada,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're doing it for a future emerging
market that's going to need it and hoping
[SPEAKER_13]: that it happens at the right time that
they can get it there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, but it's anyway.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're all we all understand
that it's just in a big transition.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're all just going to have to roll
with the punches because I don't think
[SPEAKER_13]: anyone's going to come up with a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I actually sat down and I figured
out with mathematics how much cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked in Canada and in America totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figured out that whether you smoke
marijuana, whether you smoke hashish or
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin, whatever, it can all be grown on 50
square miles in California.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the perfect climate with all the
infrastructure and all the culture and all
[SPEAKER_13]: the labor and all the great genetics and
all the great minds, just like they do
[SPEAKER_13]: with 20 other crops, we're like,
look, man, we got this.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can handle it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll actually be better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do believe that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not a California exceptionalist,
but I just believe that's the way we set
[SPEAKER_13]: up this state as an economic state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, California, Selena says the salad
bowl of America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a reason why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of prohibition, though,
we've proliferated this ideal of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: to be indoor grown, indoor looking,
even for even for the like cheap weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's people want shit that looks like
indoor, especially for flour, at least the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash is a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now all these new markets around
the world that may have historically just
[SPEAKER_02]: been where California could just grow it
all and we just export it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody thinks weeds like
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 40 years of this culture of
wanting that like indoor cannabis because
[SPEAKER_02]: of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now all these states and we're already
seeing it in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the evidence is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wants to grow their own shit and
sell it to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's like being a grower in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you going to sell your weed to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another grower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but also at the same time,
such I have to say that 30 years ago,
[SPEAKER_13]: outdoor weed looked very different than it
does today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And with the right selection and breeding,
we can I think we can create we can select
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivars that grow and seed crops that
grow so well in the ideal climate that
[SPEAKER_13]: it'll be close enough that that whole I
need it to be indoor and I need it to be
[SPEAKER_13]: depth.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be such a quick shift where people
go, wow, fifty dollars an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll win because of the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but here's a thing where the
government should be smart enough to not
[SPEAKER_02]: incentivize that because people only smoke
so much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take it from three hundred dollars
an ounce to fifty bucks an ounce,
[SPEAKER_02]: what everybody pays, all you did is turn a
two billion dollar market into a four
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred million dollar market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got everybody shot for a two billion
dollar market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everybody's trying to share for
four hundred million dollar market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happened in every single legal state.
[SPEAKER_02]: That this has occurred in what used to be
a two billion dollar markets now worth
[SPEAKER_02]: five hundred million bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does that help, especially the state
who's trying to tax it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they're shooting themselves in
the foot by doing so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are all the growers that push that
that mentality of the cultivation because
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition created this balloon market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are happy with it as long as
they're paying whatever they feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting their money's worth,
whatever that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you fully industrialize the
production and bottom the value of the
[SPEAKER_02]: product, the incentive for anyone to do
any of that, all of it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's sharing thinner and
thinner and thinner pieces of pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year, someone grows an extra acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also will always be new people
creating new varieties for the love of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: because not everybody's chasing money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, California is a whole different
world nowadays.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: California is going through its own
collapse like Oregon went through,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that Oregon's kind of been
coming out of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens in every state, you know,
and and, you know, even the biggest
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's been like some of these
monoliths that lost six hundred million
[SPEAKER_07]: like have left the state of California,
Oregon and Colorado, the three most
[SPEAKER_07]: competitive, mature markets in the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all of them are are disappearing
from competitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like they're not competitive from my
read.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like when the prohibition of
because when the prohibition of alcohol
[SPEAKER_07]: ended, there was this 80 year
consolidation among a few families before
[SPEAKER_07]: Kraft was even established in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and the big prayer is that doesn't
happen with cannabis because the
[SPEAKER_07]: prohibition of cannabis ending.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got Budweiser and Kraft running in the
same sprint, the same field in a market
[SPEAKER_07]: where it's I feel like the hype or focus
on THC is the only way to distinguish
[SPEAKER_07]: quality is such a mark of the adolescence
and the immaturity of a market because we
[SPEAKER_07]: don't even know and have the tools to
establish what is quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what happens inevitably, those that
build resilience and double down on
[SPEAKER_07]: preservation infrastructure, because when
when herb doesn't when the flood and
[SPEAKER_07]: overproduction sets in herb isn't moving
as quick as it used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it sits around and it's really
exposed to whatever infrastructure you
[SPEAKER_07]: have or don't have to care for the herb in
terms in your possession.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't have that and it goes
bad, you're just racing to the bottom with
[SPEAKER_07]: the commoditized market as opposed to
like, you know, the long game of
[SPEAKER_07]: preservation and how much that's
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't we haven't figured out how to I
mean, we know how to stabilize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know how to make it if we actually
injected it with, you know, nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_04]: argon gas to actually stabilize it because
of these large products.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the DCC has its head so far up its
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't even realize that you have to
stabilize these quality genetics because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's so much production.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sitting on the shelf for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't even get past that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, only you understand quality,
much less how to sustain quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So California is fucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just saying this so other states
can learn to fuck up so that you can learn
[SPEAKER_04]: how to do it right, because we're not big
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, I think that's what also was
illustrated in the Sally Times expose.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the state has to be overly
restrictive and testing and auditing of
[SPEAKER_07]: the laboratories that are the final check
in the integrity of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there is a robust state program to
ensure the quality of what the standards
[SPEAKER_07]: are put in place, that combined with
people doubling down to preservation
[SPEAKER_07]: infrastructure, I mean, that's there's
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but no one's incentivized to do
that when overproduction is happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's incentivized.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's where vertical like you're
doing in Oregon is building resilience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know brands in California that are
focused specifically on cultivation that
[SPEAKER_07]: have done this very thing and have in the
most flooded space built their brand to
[SPEAKER_07]: sell out quick and is trimmed cash on
delivery as a result of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're not having cash flow issues like
with the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we agree they're few and far between?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, few and far between, for sure,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, you know, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like we're because we're in live at
motion action, you know, working through
[SPEAKER_07]: quality like it's the dirtiest and
cleanest in the state competing at the
[SPEAKER_07]: same price point, the cleanest or the most
chronic and the most biomass in the state
[SPEAKER_07]: competing at the same price point.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so it's like that where we're I
think as a culture like working to power
[SPEAKER_07]: through that and be build resilience in
time where it's not looking good.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, is there is hope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those that really figure that side of
it out, build the resilience needed to
[SPEAKER_07]: make it through the deepest floods,
you know, and build that grassroot
[SPEAKER_07]: consumer loyalty around not only the
quality of their product, because there's
[SPEAKER_07]: such a huge shock in consumer trust and
confidence right now because of this,
[SPEAKER_07]: like I suppose in the L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: Times.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, you know, you can't just
like trust, you know, like you got to
[SPEAKER_07]: trust but verify.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can find a brand and like,
you know, that are not only full of built
[SPEAKER_07]: with integrity and kind of doubling down
the turps and like it's the only thing you
[SPEAKER_07]: can find in a five mile radius that's got
any flavor aroma.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a point where that matters in the
collapse of every market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just about making it through
breaking even, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: just get into that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're doing that, you're
crushing it, you know, because once this
[SPEAKER_07]: opens up, you know, there's no one in the
world that will be able to compete with
[SPEAKER_07]: the Oregon kind of California type.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, you know, if the state
prevented the overproduction of all that
[SPEAKER_02]: like this, like there's a ton of grows
that wouldn't survive without backdooring
[SPEAKER_02]: the majority of their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the state just regulated that well,
not even perfectly, but just even at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would basically get rid of all the
fluff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what people that we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That these grows that we want to see do
well, that can't afford to grow and put
[SPEAKER_02]: hand manicure and time and everything into
fifteen hundred dollar pounds where the
[SPEAKER_02]: market will actually reward them for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the retailers won't be able to bully
them because of the overproduction
[SPEAKER_02]: availability of something quote unquote
comparable that then the customer now pays
[SPEAKER_02]: the price for because they're buying three
month old weed for half the price because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you know, give me one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Colorado, when they started their
legal, it was the 70 30 rule where you had
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow 70 percent of the shit that you
sold and you had to have your own store
[SPEAKER_02]: created a great market.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just showing how it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: We even have evidence to show where it
does work.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's a great data point,
because what I'm thinking of is what Alex
[SPEAKER_09]: said about COD and terms and how that
doesn't work and how that catches up with
[SPEAKER_09]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really there's a million
reasons analogies you could bring up in
[SPEAKER_09]: terms of food, why you would pay for your
meal first.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're not going to leave the
restaurant without paying your bill.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why would you leave a disco and why
would the disco not pay you on delivery?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then furthermore, it's the distros are
forcing people into buying scenarios and
[SPEAKER_09]: buying schemes that are very familiar to
the beverage markets where you want one
[SPEAKER_09]: brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you got to buy a thousand other of
this other brand that's not moving to
[SPEAKER_09]: liquidate this inventory for me to give
you actually what you're here for.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think those types of tactics force
retailers to buy things they don't want
[SPEAKER_09]: them to then in turn kind of slow roll
things that they've bought that they do
[SPEAKER_09]: want.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it overshadows.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's this weird economy of like,
well, take a thousand of these for 200 of
[SPEAKER_09]: these.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're just in this weird economy of
of forcing yourself with the distro to buy
[SPEAKER_09]: certain things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's a deeper curtain that
I'm pulling on all of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is a problem that I see overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the cut flour industry,
Holland used to dominate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: America used to dominate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that way anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all done in Colombia, Ecuador,
you know, along the tropics, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much cheaper, the labor and you can
grow the same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly think that's the way
cannabis will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be produced words, cheaper to
produce and as high quality as the crop.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'd say cannabis is very different
than wine, but for California,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a similar dynamic.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then like the 50s and 60s,
it was a jug wine, crappy wine,
[SPEAKER_13]: cheap wine, you know, get drunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there wasn't a lot of real high end
California didn't have a name for itself
[SPEAKER_13]: globally.
[SPEAKER_13]: And while California built a name for
itself globally and France and Italy and
[SPEAKER_13]: Spain took a hit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Argentina took off and Australia
took off and South Africa took off and
[SPEAKER_13]: Chile took off.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now California competes with the
global wine market, but we still crush it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And California wine still has a brand
worldwide, you know, and that's because it
[SPEAKER_13]: was done collectively with farmers,
with regulation, with Appalachians,
[SPEAKER_13]: with UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_13]: With the state and they decided
collectively, we want to make California
[SPEAKER_13]: wine a thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want it to be a player in the global
wine world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we still are, but it took a real
concerted effort to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of luck, geographic dominance
and a lack of an indoor supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we know, you know, you can do with
greenhouses and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, Canada can supply
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need California weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could never, you could also never pass
a test if you grew a herb in Napa Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like an absolute poison
tainted the state.
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, my point is how much, what,
what could the impact of California would
[SPEAKER_13]: have sans prohibition in cannabis in terms
of a global market, you know, and what,
[SPEAKER_13]: what impact it will have in the future,
you know, so Canada might not have
[SPEAKER_13]: happened the way it did if they could buy
California wine, just like they don't,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, so they had to, but they were
forced to grow indoors, just like we're
[SPEAKER_13]: all forced to grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Canada going the way that it has kind
of proves that there's not even enough
[SPEAKER_02]: international demand really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean like to sustain even that
level of what they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like California can come online too
and grow bazillion pounds, but it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to bottom the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people go out of business and
shut down all the big farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you end up with small high-end
stuff that's servicing the local
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a few big guys that are crushing
it on some weird export thing that they
[SPEAKER_02]: figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's super lucrative there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, but they're going to
be few.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why all the, the, uh,
Kana corpse have all left California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to me, the craziest thing is this,
like, if I, if I, um, am like in the movie
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, I moved to Hollywood to go sell
my movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm in the weed industry, like these
Kana corporations, and I can't go to
[SPEAKER_02]: California and make money selling weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: How bad are you at what you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you gotta be horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like California is like this fifth
biggest economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spend money on weed, like nobody's
business there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The velocity of money in California dwarfs
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're telling me you can't make money
selling weed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're, you must suck at weed
because that'd be like me saying I went to
[SPEAKER_02]: Hollywood to sell movies and I couldn't
sell a movie there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, I'm probably not very
good.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of those people though, that what
they do, their reason why they're
[SPEAKER_07]: successful is because they've found a way
to through the high cost barrier of entry
[SPEAKER_07]: into a lot of markets that are limited
license, essentially build their own
[SPEAKER_07]: little monopoly, even though their product
can even make the cut in Oregon or
[SPEAKER_07]: California or Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just means their days are numbered
though, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And until there's no more limited
licensing states, it really, cause I see
[SPEAKER_09]: it all the time, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at, I get text messages from like
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, where this is going to firing off
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nuts, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are hungry for things that they
don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that that is a problem in our
industry where other industry comes in and
[SPEAKER_09]: they've got better ideas and they're going
to go do this because they can't afford
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can get the investment into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then what happens when you spend all
the investment and there's nothing left
[SPEAKER_09]: and there's no return, they go to another
place to do it again, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Until it's something either clicks or they
just run out of money.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it just seems to me that that's never
going to stop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like the hemp markets are never going
to stop unless there's real reform.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, but we, as you said,
Fletcher, like there's a real opportunity
[SPEAKER_09]: sitting in front of everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I get most both sides of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always say we all need to go back to the
basics and just grow really good herb
[SPEAKER_09]: again and stop worrying about the rest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the flip side of that is that someone
will say, well, I want it cheaper,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what happens when we stop saying
that it's cheaper?
[SPEAKER_09]: When we say it just costs as much,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a, I've got a funny metaphor I've
thought of before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know how we were talking about
subsidies earlier?
[SPEAKER_02]: Prohibition was a multi billion,
multi trillion over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dollar subsidy for cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They created a lack of supply which
proliferated the culture, the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that we all love, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would we want anything other than
essentially the same thing after
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition where we're basically in one
form or another enforcing, keeping things
[SPEAKER_02]: small.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what, I mean, look at the
hydroponics industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically done, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you can't even find hydro shops
on the West coast anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to drive 50 miles in between
stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, how's that good for the
economy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does that, how does that even help
the state after prohibition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they want, they looked at weed and
go, look how much it's worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell, you remember the old news
articles, a pounds worth $8,000,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tell you it's worth 50 pounds is
4 million bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, that's, they were
looking at it like we're going to get our
[SPEAKER_02]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here they are.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just allow overproduction and,
you know, now warehouse is full of super
[SPEAKER_12]: stacks, full of hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: From last year, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Just chuck full of 400 to 500 pounds per
super sack, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And as that shit was all grown last year
and it ain't moving because the CBD
[SPEAKER_12]: market's been stagnated.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what are people doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: They're spraying that shit with THCA or
THC rather, putting it into pre-rolls and
[SPEAKER_12]: selling it at gas stations and bodegas in
New York city.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, New York city is just such an
interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't need to have time to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go into it, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Colin will tell you this, that every time
they make some big announcement about
[SPEAKER_12]: trying to shut down the trap market in New
York, because the trap market is just,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's just, there's just like 10 shops on
every block in Manhattan, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And you could buy, you know, a nice,
you know, sandwich and get a drink and
[SPEAKER_12]: then buy some weed at the same store,
you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fucking crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the stuff is all fueled by legal
leads from another state.
[SPEAKER_12]: Alex said it earlier too.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, what's happening now,
because I think I had said this earlier
[SPEAKER_12]: and hey, Fletch, it's good to see you
again, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a while, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's an order of magnitude cheaper to
make THC from CBD isolate than it is to
[SPEAKER_12]: grow weed, extract it and distill it and
refine it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Into that same molecule of THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll pay 10 times the amount to get to
that same molecule of THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, this is just, yeah,
it's a shit show.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's being commoditized.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how any cannabis companies
expect to make any money when the
[SPEAKER_12]: competition can sell an $8 vape pen two
clicks after you said you're 21 on a
[SPEAKER_12]: website.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're asking you for your credit card
information, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's no way that the regulated
cannabis market can continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta sell the chronic and service a
specific consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta make a brand promise and they
trust you and that's why they do business
[SPEAKER_02]: with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on board with you, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: The majority of beer drinkers in this
country drink Budweiser Bud Light Quill
[SPEAKER_12]: that they buy in cases at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, when you could buy weed at Walmart and
it's booth weed with spray Delta-8 on it
[SPEAKER_12]: and you could buy it at Walmart,
all those Walmart consumers are gonna buy
[SPEAKER_12]: it by the ton.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna be a new Prevagen or new Cunal,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll see... I mean, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Budweiser also has a lot of glyphosate
in it and glyphosate is one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_07]: desertifiers of the microbiome that leads
to like 80% of all long-term chronic
[SPEAKER_07]: illness autoimmune conditions of all types
into cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, I think we're entering
into this world of this time of radical
[SPEAKER_07]: transparency because of how compromised
the food system is how compromised all
[SPEAKER_07]: these systems are and captured by
corporate poisoning industries.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it's leading in this era for
those that are trying to live a long-term
[SPEAKER_07]: healthy life and not get Parkinson's or
dementia or ALS or Alzheimer's in their
[SPEAKER_07]: late time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have to be radically aware
of what you're putting in or on your body,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and I think that it's really
helps us to kind of get into that zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reality is like, yeah,
there's gonna be Budweiser, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the more we can do to kind of,
you know, identify tests, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: because taxes are destroying everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's so much destroying
everything to say not regulating labs,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I think ultimately the testing,
again, the biggest barrier of entry to
[SPEAKER_07]: keep out the poisonous people that are,
you know, their only game is to like
[SPEAKER_07]: monocrop against, you know, desiccate with
glyphosate, you know, like the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, but the thing is, is that's also
poisoning ourselves is poisoning the
[SPEAKER_07]: planet is poisoning all life species.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that's the long run
that's going to succeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But those that are like radically
transparent and able to kind of build
[SPEAKER_07]: long-term kind of loyalty around that,
you know, I think is how kind of a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: those that are in most integrity of the
plant are going to like find their path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you think that the majority of the
people in America eat heavily processed
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical grown food?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also developing all these
long-term problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all I'm saying is they're still buying
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you want to jump, I know you want
to jump, but I want to make, I want to
[SPEAKER_12]: make a point before you end this episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a great episode of guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about a lot of stuff,
but you know, Unilever, the multi-billion
[SPEAKER_12]: dollar consumer product corporation,
Unilever, they're the people who make,
[SPEAKER_12]: who bring us Hellman's mayonnaise,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you like mayonnaise on
your BLT, but it's probably better.
[SPEAKER_11]: They own like 150 food companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they're, they're just this huge mega
consumer product.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they have a new advertising slogan
or a new advertising kind of gist where
[SPEAKER_12]: they want to talk about sustainable
farming practices because they use soybean
[SPEAKER_12]: oil in the manufacture of mayonnaise,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and they talk about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they, they, they, they show customers
walking into like a deli and then getting
[SPEAKER_12]: like a sandwich that's got nothing in the
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a pretty provocative kind of,
you know, consumer campaign, but it's,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's, it's really, it's not paying
attention to Marcus.
[SPEAKER_12]: What you guys figured out in Canada,
which is that the driver for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_12]: have ultimately is not THC and it's not
CBD and it's really not medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fucking food.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody eats food, not everyone smokes
weed, like Alex said, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a limited market when it comes
to, you know, how widespread can you
[SPEAKER_12]: produce cannabis?
[SPEAKER_12]: But ultimately, if you're trying to
displace soybean on protein per acre,
[SPEAKER_12]: now you're up against the industrial
agricultural food complex of Archer's
[SPEAKER_12]: Daniel Midland, Bungee, DuPont,
Syngenta, you know, all those chemical
[SPEAKER_12]: companies, all of them without exception
bought seed companies so they could
[SPEAKER_12]: genetically engineer their seeds to be
resistant to their fungicides and their
[SPEAKER_12]: insecticides and herbicides.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I think the ultimate driver here,
Alex, I don't know, I could be wrong on
[SPEAKER_12]: this.
[SPEAKER_12]: When it comes to protein per acre,
I think with soybeans, you can get
[SPEAKER_12]: somewhere between 360 to 380 pounds of
soluble protein per acre with hemp and
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam, tell me if these numbers are in line
with what you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hemp with the high, like, fanola high oil
variety strains.
[SPEAKER_12]: They think the estimates are somewhere
like a thousand pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're a farmer and you're looking
to raise, I don't know, protein for your
[SPEAKER_12]: livestock feed because you need to make
more red meat hamburgers for Big Macs and
[SPEAKER_12]: leather shoes and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, protein per acre, it's gonna
matter how productive that acre of land
[SPEAKER_12]: could be.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you could make a thousand pounds on
that acre versus just 360 pounds an acre,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now, again, you're up against the
industrial agricultural complex of these
[SPEAKER_12]: huge multinational corporations that need
to keep raising soybeans, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you look at soybeans, soybeans keep
going up, keep going up, keep going up.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing that keeps going up is the
amount of chemicals that are applied to
[SPEAKER_12]: the land where the soybeans are grown.
[SPEAKER_12]: We know hemp doesn't need the chemical
applications.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the chemical companies that own the
seed companies have a vested interest to
[SPEAKER_12]: keep soybeans being grown, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they're selling tons of chemicals,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_12]: When hemp takes over, they don't need to
sell those chemicals anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I mean, I think food is gonna be
the ultimate driver.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you're wrong for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: And cannabis protein is like the it's like
the cannabis of food.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is so complex and so perfect and so
incredible.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been compared to breast milk,
you know, in regards to the essential,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, acids, all of the ones that
adults need, the ratios of three to one
[SPEAKER_11]: GLNA to GLA, all of that plays a factor as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, this has been fucking an
incredible conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I spoke twice because I was really
just enjoying listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have felt bad for people in the past
who haven't spoken much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I can appreciate their
perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're not speaking much,
you're listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're getting more out of it than you
probably get out of it when you share.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Kevin McKernan for coming
on and sharing his data.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Colin, for inviting him and
getting him on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for coming on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Alec Dixon, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: You crushed it today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, dude, I always want to have you on
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your perspective is so valid.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so conscious and so loving and
empathetic and true to the nature of what
[SPEAKER_11]: we all sort of believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grandmaster LED, thanks for sharing it on
your channel and letting everyone know
[SPEAKER_11]: about Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had 300 people watching live for
like four hours right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always a pleasure to see you and have you
in the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade, laughter, bring in laughter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just with your presence, really appreciate
your brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, Mojave Richmond, I really
appreciated what you said today,
[SPEAKER_11]: man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great to have your perspective
bouncing off with Fletch.
[SPEAKER_11]: A super honor to have you come out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're not always available and
you're busy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved what you wrote in the chat room
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send out an email to
everyone to remind them that maybe missed
[SPEAKER_11]: what you said.
[SPEAKER_11]: In private, they can reach out to you
through the Hash Church email.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you're going to come back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come back again and share more greatness
with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Skunkman Sam, I'm so glad you made it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was worried the whole time for a couple
hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, he's going to miss it.
[SPEAKER_11]: As the conversation got better and better,
I felt like maybe he is going to come in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And at hour three, you came in and blessed
us with an hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: At Tain Fontaine, my brother, I'm so glad
you made it.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the OG Hash Church panelists hasn't
been able to make it out for the last
[SPEAKER_11]: couple because he's been traveling,
I believe, to Greenland and now
[SPEAKER_11]: Newfoundland.
[SPEAKER_11]: And probably eventually back to
California.
[SPEAKER_11]: So really nice to hear from your
perspective and hear your passion today.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Brian, dude, I'm glad you came in and
shared your vibes with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to continue this conversation next
week.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're all invited back and let's crush
this out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm seeing for the first time how
important this dialogue is for our
[SPEAKER_11]: industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's great that we're all doing our
individual things on our own.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we get together, the synergistic
gain that we produce with bouncing off
[SPEAKER_11]: each other, not always agreeing with each
other, sharing different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved the different perspectives from
Mojave and Fletch today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Both so valid.
[SPEAKER_11]: No one getting upset with one another,
but both just showing these different
[SPEAKER_11]: perspectives.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the conversation that is
happening in Hash Church is an important
[SPEAKER_11]: one.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it helped steer the industry in the
past.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that we can help steer at least
the community in the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you all so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's all see each other next Sunday,
shall we?
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Todd.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to everyone watching.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to everyone watching.
[SPEAKER_11]: We really appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
