[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I did a Facebook
Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I kind of feel like I'm at a weird
angle right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I can sit around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still working?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my phone kind of upside down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got a few people coming in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll gear up for a little bong rip while
we talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello dust and bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robias, James Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just saw them pop in and say,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Devin Simmons, Jared Scully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone's doing well today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers to you as well, Chris Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA representative, Adam Holzowski.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I saw a little DNA action in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always love my buddies at DNA,
Don and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Known those guys for over 10 years and
super stoked to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of stoked to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expanding into many different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've got their LP thing going
with Tweed and they took a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: guff for that, but it's nice to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if you've got a complaint about a big
corporate cannabis company and you see a
[SPEAKER_00]: guys like DNA go in, don't slag on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them support.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to actually not sell out,
but to actually make the thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's complaining about much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's important that we see that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Patrick and Jeffery, Jen Bennett,
Michael Manas, Tom McCluskey, Chili Boo in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house, Matt Armstrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time for a little six star
bubble hash here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freeze-dried to damn near perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the cold these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to make things cold,
cold, cold, cold, cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love making hash myself because you
know, when you make oil, what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: losing and missing out on, I'm not saying
you're missing out on or losing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is not there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a fibrous mat inside the trichome
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where the glandular trichome
biosynthesizes cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does it through vacuoles and organelles
called plastids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plastids are filled with phenols and
terpenes and they push up into the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that fibrous mat is where we
basically biosynthesize all of the known
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you squeeze or extract with oil,
with solvents, you basically leave that
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrous mat behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why there is such a difference
between oil and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's why someone like Haley,
Cheryl T's daughter, suffered from
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures like you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took her off oil, they put her on
bubble hash capsules and suddenly she's
[SPEAKER_00]: not having seizures for 30 or 40 or 50
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not going to work with
everyone, but it's definitely one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: major differences between oil and between
hash and why they're not the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and why I love the quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to be just an oil or just
a hash guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always going to want to offer people
the majority of both of those things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Mateen Tabrizi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been a while since I've seen you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mateen is a smart young guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I remember correctly,
you caked up a little bit of coin from an
[SPEAKER_00]: app that you made or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember talking to you for some
time back in the day on different chats.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Archie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Archie in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always see Archie at the different events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the last one I might have seen him
at was in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always tell Archie is so
gung-ho.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes and stands at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's sharing vibes and he's not leaving
for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Andy?
[SPEAKER_00]: RIP to the ex, my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought about you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was going to tag you on my post and then I
realized I unfollowed you because you...
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy is the greatest guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy Cale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a fucking great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to the internet,
I found you just to be too much of a dick
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had to unfollow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just your internet personality in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're a great fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't handle you online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I totally would have tagged you
in the Michelle Rainey post today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's up, Philip Edward Pearson?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope all is well with you in Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to light up the straight fab
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are hitting the five star.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are hitting the West Coast concentrate
San Fernando Valley OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything degrades democracy and free
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I still be attending the Karma Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plan is to go to the Karma Cup.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about you often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some intense moments together with
your parents almost dying and then my
[SPEAKER_00]: parents actually dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: 93 people online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at a straight fab killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice to be puffing on some lovely West
Coast concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Tommy West.
[SPEAKER_00]: James Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin, this winter is close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live close to Whistler, so winter is
closer than you can actually imagine for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I got a big jar of buds from D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me some of his super fucking fire
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys can see that,
but trust me that this is who I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: press this whole jar today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, because I don't smoke the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just extract the resin off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my my little unit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to come check it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you bringing turps to the Karma Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like me to bring turps to the to
the to the cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got this bad boy going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's heating up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's at 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bring her up probably not
quite to 250 because that's my hash
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, very cool that he made me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cool customized plates to Old Man's
World Sasquatch for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to fucking press some rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the gig right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this to 15 gallon air compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes everything groovy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if this is If this gets going,
I will get back on here and we will we
[SPEAKER_00]: will check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Ryan, I will bring turps for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What turps would you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I just bring a couple of packs of
each flavor and then you can pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they're going to be sealed,
so I can't be opening up each one and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting everyone smell all 50 or 30
varieties that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my only sort of problem with the
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, only the bottom plate heats up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I have them closed because the
bottom plate heats the top plate up and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is absolutely the Mercedes rosin
presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan Holler 100% and that bubble hit or
that bubble hit got me lit really nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This SFV OG happy to have a little West
Coast concentrate back in the back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also didn't really mention it,
but I dabbed red Congolese with that SFO G
[SPEAKER_00]: SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring me your three faves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll definitely have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll probably be like Karma's bitch,
Kush cleaner and maybe red Congolese,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to trust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to trust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring some water hash too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually the West Coast concentrate
guys may be at my booth at booth 197.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although with the Karma cup losing,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it up very close,
unfortunately, but I can trust that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: six star.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freeze dried, so it has that really
light color and then on the edges where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gumming up and and and greasing out
is where I've been picking it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely super fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey Kush cleaner is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes, they do have a review coming out
of that SFV for the THCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They better get it out soon because I'm
filming mine today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are busy, busy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm busier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am set up with camera galore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how about this my brand new 4K camera
that I bought the other day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I dropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making funny funny sounds on the
inside kind of bummed out still films,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's got moving parts inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So might be on a little bit of a break for
videos once I send that in to get it fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: my old video camera, which is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's going to be doing the
job that it was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before so I might have to start filming on
my on my 5D on this big bad boy right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I might start filming on for
a few videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tougher because it doesn't have that
same ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know I'm the worst with
electronics crashed my drone to and fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up the gimbal on the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just you know what just take it in
get it fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the end of the world when you do
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are you things that you use to to to
play with and to get to get that gravy
[SPEAKER_00]: footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ian Doran to be honest, I'm getting
it fixed right away and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually just a piece of plastic on the
inside that broke and that it's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: actually major because there's no nothing
in the camera is affected at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already filmed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already recorded with it and Hey
right on Nolan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you had a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll have one more dab before we
split.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I think about the TCC syrup bar
and cannabis culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fucking like it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a very I mean I I see
everyone trying to take different things
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can sort of see the perspective of
trying to make sipping syrup a better
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really my perspective is that sipping
syrup is really like a scourge and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a tear on the social fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I would want to
promote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I can't personally
believe cannabis culture or the Karma Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: is supporting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have these companies
sponsoring things, that's what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: people say good things about their product
because they have a biased and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making money with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hello there mom Paulette Richardson in
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not a big fan fan of like keep in
mind this promethazine syrup, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: where they mix in with Jolly Ranchers and
Sprite and a few other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vice has a documentary on it and it's
definitely not pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really see how a lot of these guys
are addicted to it like very badly
[SPEAKER_00]: addicted to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of all-around bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it as not a positive and I'm
surprised that it's sort of squeezing into
[SPEAKER_00]: the into the cannabis world because I just
I mean, yeah, you want to sip cannabis you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why market it as a syrup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why market it as as lean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the stuff they're selling at cannabis
culture is not opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a THC version.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying is why even promote
and teach and educate about syrup or lean
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's negative to Ian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I'm not into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not it's my own personal
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to go out and do anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be like I did kind of
text Jody at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I texted one other person saying
is this for real like a syrup bar like
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't that does anyone else think that
that's weird, but apparently no,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of people do but that's my
answer and I'm sorry if it upsets,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the caribou company or cannabis
culture or the karma cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I wouldn't personally take that
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally wouldn't even if I was trying
to pay my rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just choose to figure out
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, if it can steer lean heads
away from THC, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is potential Pro but to me,
it's a strange thing to grab a hold of and
[SPEAKER_00]: promote a product as in and if you look at
these companies, they've made the bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: look just like the promise of his
methazine bottles the cough syrup bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's definitely 100% promoted as hey,
like check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the THC lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you there Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to send out the good vibes
sex sells drug sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's business sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I've also never really done
that someone asked me the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you got money man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you just hire some hot chicks at
your booth and I was like, ooh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not really how I like to promote my
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot about my product and I'm not
saying that there's anything wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: hot chicks by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think that personally I want
to use sexuality and girls to attract
[SPEAKER_00]: people to my booth to then try and you
know, lay into them with the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: that we currently have I'm more like hey,
if you want to come by and learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll gladly spend a half an hour talking
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to try and bring people
in with with with scantily clad girls and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for almost 20 years
and I've never done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squish on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Chadwick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bustardo in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is compassion from the old
overgrow days.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the originator of the rosin
technique at least in the original first
[SPEAKER_00]: that we all saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and it was different from the squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was the timing wasn't on but
he was taking hash and you know in a
[SPEAKER_00]: double boiler milking the resin glands out
of non melty hash around a metal bowl or a
[SPEAKER_00]: glass bowl and he has some amazing
pictures if you punch in compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: C-O-M-P-H-A-S-O-N and full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: His pictures will come up and you can see
what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you Chadwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean I still like to give props
where props are due.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the first person I ever heard talk
about that and it wasn't until years like
[SPEAKER_00]: a decade later that that soil grown was
squishing a bud and it's funny because
[SPEAKER_00]: even all of that happened for a unique
reason the way Tony was actually using a
[SPEAKER_00]: small hair straightener to press out his
bubble and I used to always laugh at these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys because they're like, yeah,
we take the full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it in the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We close it and then we press it out into
dabs and I was just an old school like
[SPEAKER_00]: really I just squeeze mine in my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was from Tony doing that that
Nikkatee picked it up and others and when
[SPEAKER_00]: Nikkatee was doing it it was soil grown
who saw Nikkatee doing that and he just
[SPEAKER_00]: tried it with a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just you know because he was squeezing
hash but when he ran out of hash and he
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't squeezing it for raws and he was
just squeezing it to press it into dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess one time he squeezed it a
little hard and a little bit of oil came
[SPEAKER_00]: out then he ran out of hash and he got a
bud and he thought maybe I'll just try
[SPEAKER_00]: squishing a bud and he squished it and
literally got results and that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: how it all kind of came around you know it
was it wasn't like he was watching Chad's
[SPEAKER_00]: post from back in the day it was really an
accident that happened from you know some
[SPEAKER_00]: things that Tony was doing Pat and then
other people kind of picked up and started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and that he saw that person doing
and then did this accidental thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: these are his words he told this story on
hash church 25 or 30 or whatever number it
[SPEAKER_00]: was that that he first came on and we did
the whole rosy episode which if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: back a lot of the rosin in from all the
companies came after that episode there
[SPEAKER_00]: was not a single person creating
industrial presses or using presses to
[SPEAKER_00]: make rosin at that point it was a hair
straightener thing and after that dialogue
[SPEAKER_00]: in hash church that's where it all started
that's where people picked up these ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: to start making presses and products and
the 50 companies were born overnight and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been interesting to see it's
definitely been interesting to see yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: sure is Chadwick I agree I'm doing well
Ivan I'm not gonna complain I think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna take another dab with you guys and
then let you all go kind of said I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be talking about cannabis and I
don't know if we really talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at all but well we talked about
hash and that's a part of cannabis this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice bubble really nice think I'm
gonna go back into the red conga lease mmm
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah just remnants in this jar right now
but I'll tell you these terpene jars are
[SPEAKER_00]: never empty never empty and if you guys
haven't gone on blue river extracts dot CA
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian site I lowered the price of
the Jamaican terpenes down to like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know like 70 bucks a vile but only if you
buy the one ml so I lowered it very
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially you buy one ml and you get
it for 300 bucks and that's four packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: point two five ml so people complaining
about the price don't say I never did
[SPEAKER_00]: anything good for you all three of the
Jamaican terpenes are available in one mls
[SPEAKER_00]: which is four of the ten drop vials 40
drops and it's like 300 bucks so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially cheaper than anything I've
had available hello Heidi Hanford welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome anything new happening always
something new happening dude Chad you
[SPEAKER_00]: should come over one of these days I've
got like 20 varieties in my pelican case
[SPEAKER_00]: at any time I did not see the price of
clones from Whistler five clones for 750
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty ridiculous I'll have to mock
them about that I'm gonna go see them soon
[SPEAKER_00]: and do a little walk through of their
facility so why not the regular Terps I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what you mean by regular Terps
I just got some blue river from Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: love the extract well Evan all the
information is on the website so you look
[SPEAKER_00]: up the strain you had you go into the SC
labs the the testing area he's got a big
[SPEAKER_00]: spot that says testing and then you just
go look at the variety that you have and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can print it up and you'll have all
the information that you want about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: there hello there Lisa Lorraine's Werner
I'm not sure what you mean by regular
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps Ramundo yeah 750s ouch I'll be there
first thing on Saturday to pick up that
[SPEAKER_00]: three pack Nathan's coming for Terps well
I'll try to have them for you there I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna bring a bunch of Terps I hope to see
you guys in Toronto have a big session
[SPEAKER_00]: will be great and we'll have some West
Coast concentrate bubble hash as well
[SPEAKER_00]: well Ramundo because they cost more and
I'm not gonna sell them at a loss
[SPEAKER_00]: the non Jamaican ones are from California
and if you've ever been to those two
[SPEAKER_00]: places you'll understand that the price of
good cannabis in California is very
[SPEAKER_00]: different from the price of good cannabis
in Jamaica we've passed that savings on to
[SPEAKER_00]: you but we certainly can't offer it to you
with our California flavor unfortunately I
[SPEAKER_00]: wish I could I really do but you know what
I'll say this much if you like what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing if you appreciate all the
information that I share if you've used
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bags for all of these years and
learned how to dry sift with me and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate hash church and all of these
different things that I bring including
[SPEAKER_00]: these live video Facebook's it's not a bad
idea to support me in my new ventures I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't say this very often but if you have
a friend that you think is great and so
[SPEAKER_00]: and you and you want to support them for
God's sakes don't ask them for a deal on
[SPEAKER_00]: their product while they're starting a
company if anything and they're your
[SPEAKER_00]: friend pay extra they are struggling and
remember all of their friends are asking
[SPEAKER_00]: for the same thing a deal and what a deal
means to someone who's starting their new
[SPEAKER_00]: company is for them to cut out their
profit and when they cut out their profit
[SPEAKER_00]: they're unable to succeed in their new
business and the thing that you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: said I supported that company in early
days I used to buy those packs for full
[SPEAKER_00]: price and I supported him that's amazing
that's how you keep good companies around
[SPEAKER_00]: do we want to bring the price down
absolutely is it going to stay the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: is absolutely not we are going to non-stop
lower and lower and lower and lower the
[SPEAKER_00]: price but that's all about manifesting
cheaper pounds being able to buy more
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds being able to take control of
larger greenhouses there's a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of shit that's involved with this and all
I'm saying is don't always ask for a deal
[SPEAKER_00]: you know sometimes it's okay to support
and I'm not just talking with me remove me
[SPEAKER_00]: from the equation remove my company I'm
talking about your friends that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: in life that are starting a business can
you for God's sakes support their business
[SPEAKER_00]: by paying the normal price do not ask for
a deal it's a horrible non friendship
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to do if anything well the topic
right now Martin is you know friends
[SPEAKER_00]: starting new companies do we want to ask
them for the deal or do we want to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: them to pay the price or I mean I've done
this paid a higher price because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: support my friends business and I don't
need to do that for five years but maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first year or two that I support
that business I won't mind paying full
[SPEAKER_00]: price because I know it's a hell of a
thing starting a new business it's a hell
[SPEAKER_00]: of a thing and the tax man's gonna come
after you and the brokerage and the
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping and the your costs the people you
buy your products from will constantly try
[SPEAKER_00]: to raise that like everything is an
endless price up one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: with bubble bags that I very much not done
over the years is raise the price I came
[SPEAKER_00]: out with a high price because I knew I'm
gonna offer a lifetime warranty and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the price I'm gonna offer
incredible customer service and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to be accessible to all my
customers meaning you'll be able to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to me personally you'll be able to call me
up or email me or text me and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: answer your question that's something that
I do hey welcome Nick Tello so that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going off on about that no one even
asked for a price break someone just asked
[SPEAKER_00]: why the non Cali or why the non Jamaican
terpenes weren't on sale and it brought me
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember this that I said before in
here that it was that it's okay sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: to support a business don't always feel
like you have to grind someone down
[SPEAKER_00]: because here's the bottom line when you go
buy the coca-cola at the grocery store
[SPEAKER_00]: from the multi-billion dollar coca-cola
company do you ask for a deal no you
[SPEAKER_00]: swallow whatever price they're fucking
offering you now I personally don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking support well I probably support
coca-cola through one of the thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: companies they own but I don't drink
coca-cola I generally don't drink pop try
[SPEAKER_00]: not to anyway but it's funny because
people in India will grind the guy on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the road who's selling juice to
put food on his table for his kids but
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll go buy like a coca-cola or a Fanta
and just pay full price and not even worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about you know the the cost difference
there I think that we've gotten stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: this very strange experience of not
realizing that because because it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to earn money and you know when you
earn money you realize well shit I can
[SPEAKER_00]: save money by just trying to get a deal
trying to use that coupon trying to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the best possible sometimes people
will stack you know they'll be like I want
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical prize plus I heard you got a
coupon plus I heard it's a Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: discount it's like often I'll just be like
you can have the bags and I've given away
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds if not thousands of sets of
bubble bags over the last 20 years happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that you know and that's another
thing that when you're paying full price
[SPEAKER_00]: you can know that it's like a almost a
form of any type of you know I don't talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about my philanthropy but I do it I do
philanthropy and when you support my
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that philanthropy is now part of
you you're you're a part of it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you know doing things like when Chimera
got busted sending him some money so he
[SPEAKER_00]: could get up on his feet when Mark went to
jail sending Jody to see him in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi those planes and hotels and
car rentals all cost money so things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that I try to do on the regular in my
community I won't post about them and I
[SPEAKER_00]: won't generally talk about them but they
get done and that's another part of just
[SPEAKER_00]: you know supporting and paying paying the
price yeah Drew I feel you you know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I feel yeah Nick I would love to be
talking to your customers I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know where you're at right now but a smoke
shop sounds cool it's always fun to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to if you guys share this on your
Facebook the people that watch your
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook's are able to see this as well so
that's one thing that you can do and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's wonderful any new things with the
charitable orgs I mean you know like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said I don't generally talk about it too
much the stuff that I'm doing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: charity but I promise you I do it I find
even mentioning the few little ones here
[SPEAKER_00]: now it takes I mentioned those because
they're long and they were mentioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: public by those two people but I won't
mention other ones because I feel that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just helping someone so people can
know about it then you're kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: douchebag and I'm sure that they still got
help but I feel that it takes away you
[SPEAKER_00]: know absolutely Andrew yeah that sounds
like slinger for sure slinger is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend of mine we've got a long history
together and that sounds very much like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that would come out of his mouth
for sure where's the shop Nick is it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada or is it in the US when is the Blue
River getting the beaver turps we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on the beaver turps give us time
