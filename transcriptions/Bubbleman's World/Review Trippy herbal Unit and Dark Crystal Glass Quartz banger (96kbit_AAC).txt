[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World,
and I guess welcome to a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what I've got right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what I have, but I'm kind
of going for the, uh, this is a brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, and someone just sent it to me,
and I just... Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I often get products sent to me from
different companies, and this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: product got sent to me from Dark Crystal
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Crystal Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fine piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can check these guys out at
DCGlass.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's D-C-G-L-A-S-S dot C-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the owner is Mick, and I've dealt with
him for some years when he was
[SPEAKER_00]: representing a riser or a ritzer from the
Solo Vaporizer and those different units I
[SPEAKER_00]: sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traded a bunch through him and did a
little bit of business, and that's how I
[SPEAKER_00]: got to know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, he called me up and he said,
I want to send you a couple of these
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very much like the Quav
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look almost identical to it from
where I sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to him that I was excited that
he wanted to send me a couple,
[SPEAKER_00]: but right off the bat I said, you know
what, send me two because I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: send one to the guys at D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know much about quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are different levels of
qualities of quartz, and I know that those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys seem to pay the most attention to
such thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they don't offer cheap quartz
at D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nails are $200 to $300 just for a
single quartz nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was very excited that I wanted to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, oh great, great, great,
because this is German quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super high quality, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shows up in a nice little case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of give you the show there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lean in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got that little banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess really the only way to try such
a thing is to prepare some dabs and heat
[SPEAKER_00]: this little butter up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my Swiss perk for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure this will be a great little
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 90 degree perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my torch right here for heating it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just really a matter of getting a
little bowl of hash together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some gummier hash here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to just press it up into a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you guys have been paying
attention to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the rage these days is to grab the
little mini hair straightener and use
[SPEAKER_00]: some, I wouldn't personally use just
parchment, but what Tony was using in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, which was the oil slick
parchment, I guess it's a Teflon level of
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a nice dab of some varieties of
hash that I just squeezed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it onto the dabber there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get our little torch turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not a huge torch guy, but I got to
say I do love the idea of the shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: the color of this quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used many quav bangers,
but it's a great, it's easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it if you're filming or you're
watching and you want to watch your
[SPEAKER_00]: product bubble and melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just a matter of getting the
quartz hot enough so I can take a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a thick quartz bowl, I'll tell
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My little mini torch is barely getting the
job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got another thing that was sent to me
recently as well by another company that
[SPEAKER_00]: will go over right after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got to be hot, even though
it's really not showing any signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: orange the way it normally does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, great taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you the thickness on this
quartz is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely, it never got orange,
which I was waiting for it to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell that it was hot as fuck and
it still took a beautiful hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Condensed a little bit of oil off of the
hash onto the inside of the quartz,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I got to say that's a real nice quartz
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too shabby, dark crystal glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see a ton of these on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be fooled by the glass ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really the safest bet to be
torching and cooling and torching and
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quartz is much better for such things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice thick looking glass quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smoke it for the next few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure on the cost on these,
but I would guess if they're the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: that he said they were when he sent them,
they're not going to be $20 or $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to probably be $100 plus,
but check the website www.dcglass.ca and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can give Mick a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell him Bubba Man sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might even get a little discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mick, for sending this out,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see me hitting it more every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on to our second package
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't pulled this guy out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is stuck to the bottom of this
one.
I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make some room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surrounded in hashish here,
as you probably already have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a really nice package to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This package comes from Emilio and the
good people at Trippy Sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of you guys have been asking
me, do you still use Trippy Sticks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still use Trippy Sticks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely still use Trippy Sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that the Trippy Stick is perfect
for certain situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, when we were at the Hobbit,
part three of the Hobbit, we were trippy
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking down the Congolese like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very, very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what Mr. Emilio has sent in
this little package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like an exciting package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the bat, he's got these bags of
Trippy Wipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just basically alcohol wipes,
but it's nice to have a big schwack of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that he's smart for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did call Emilio with the Trippy Wipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got, let's see what else
we've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a variety of things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a really cool tri-colored green,
gray, and blue Trippy Stick 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be one of the newest units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty damn nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what he's done here is on the
smaller half unit, these little ones here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, oh yeah, these are much higher
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the crack, you can see when you
crack them open that it's a much deeper,
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a larger, deeper ceramic dish and
a lot more of the titanium wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's how he's changed that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might even be a Trippy 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the mini.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess him and Berner went and did a
combo, a collab on the little,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cloud type style pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, this is totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, no, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that ever look cool though?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like they were really,
really thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the original Trippy Stick and
then Cloud and many other companies came
[SPEAKER_00]: out with this similar style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved my Trippy Stick of this style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have my gold Trippy Stick of this
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these say cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a red one and a white one and
they both say cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got their mouthpieces and one
single charger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad, Emilio, not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emilio and Berner putting it out there
with the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we all know the cookies are pretty
much one of the most popular strains going
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, especially down in Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in Amsterdam, people were all up and
down about cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he also sent some tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Trippy Stick tools, which I was
excited to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got these all lined together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see those there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that he's got one for pushing
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got one that's a little more gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a rubber tip on the end of it
and then one for scooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that these guys were
definitely smart to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been waiting for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's got them in the other color
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got them in the dark black and in
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two little colors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to say, I saved what I think is
the best for last.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pretty excited about this
particular Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched him post about it a few times
and then it wasn't very much longer that
[SPEAKER_00]: he was contacting me and saying,
Hey man, when can I send you one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: units?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Herbal Unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I'm excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even seen these in real life
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only seen pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a pretty nice looking unit,
Emilio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that big cuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big cube unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and lightweight in the hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, when you open it
up, just like everything Emilio does,
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy's got style.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that he really represents and
respects people's styles and how people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be different and have styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of one of the things that
I've really seen that I've liked from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Trippy Stick crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a USB or a little plug on the
bottom for play to record it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top pops off right nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top, I'm going to come show you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top has a little screen right on top
of the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then inside, you've got your chamber
that actually fits a decent amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, I've never used this a
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is me using it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emilio never told me how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little brush for cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a micro USB cord and a USB outlet
for charging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tips are, a slow and steady inhale puff
will produce the best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a classic vaporizer tip,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hauling on it, it just cools the elements
down and it gives you less of a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're talking about really taking
this slow draw.
[SPEAKER_00]: They highly recommend the Trippy tools for
packing and removing herbs from the vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got the list of tools here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they mention the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see how we can turn this bad boy
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she goes right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the unit is on, you will see numbers
in the LCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press and hold for four seconds,
then release.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LCD will light up and the vapor bulb
will start heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I better put a little herb in the
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some really nice herb recently given
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is star, star bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can give you guys a little close
up on this little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the quality on that nugget?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, it's quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I've got a little hair on my
thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press and hold for four seconds,
then release, and it'll heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm excited to see this little unit
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bud is perfectly dried for
vaporization, I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me use my Trippy tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess right off the bat, probably one
real good idea is to not overpack this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and press the herbs down as hard as
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not the greatest idea,
but I'm going to put it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so put that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the second thing said to hold this
for four seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we're back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned itself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to hold this for four
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys can see it,
but it's heating up to 150 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: 180 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: 230 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start taking tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 degrees and I can taste the vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I think I'm going to like this
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been waiting for a nice sleek
handheld unit that I can use without
[SPEAKER_00]: breakable parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: For longer than I can say, let's get her
up to about 400 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, 390 let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, really nice unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show the camera later how fast it
climbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, was that tasty vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this is almost a different
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vapor is coming through like really
strong, but thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can taste the flavor of that plant on my
lips in a way that is so strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely strong Cush flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say, this very well may be a
bubble man godsend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I saw it at Emilio and I wasn't
overly excited when I saw just the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram photos and stuff, but once
again, dude, you've blown me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: As simple as sending me a unit and letting
me try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really nice light vapor rips from
this thing and when's the last time I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to really just vape herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the last time I had my sublimator
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys from Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an A1 product that I can guarantee
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to have a lot of
copycats because I can just tell it just
[SPEAKER_00]: feels good in the hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small, compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that has real potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding its temperature perfectly,
but not burning the herb that's inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The element must be below, holding the
temperature perfectly, but somehow being
[SPEAKER_00]: kept from heating up the herb that's right
above it because I'm able to sit and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's still at 391 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny, tiny little bit of new piece taste
when I took my first rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the purity of the vapor was so clean
and nice that it really overpowered even
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of new taste smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means a lot to me because people
offer me cannabis all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Flav gave me this bud just
the other day of the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was saying to me, oh, you know,
do you have a vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, you know, I'll leave
you a bud anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few days later, Emilio sends me
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to say thank you to the Dark
Crystal Glass, a fine piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a fine piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to definitely use it some more
and see what I can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice, thick quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was really impressed with
the thickness of the quartz that he used.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not skimp on this whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be talking to you guys more about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times do I heat it up and let it
cool down and whether or not I have any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, whether or not it explodes
in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep you guys posted as to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll probably end up having these on
my website before long if I really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here, I can tell you for
sure is going to be available at bubblebag
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check us out at bubblebag.com for your
trippy stick needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got you covered now both in
concentrate vaporizers as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure we're going to end up
getting some of these cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're limited editions,
but what a nice little box of two that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A white and a red unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate the kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank everyone for watching Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
