[SPEAKER_02]: I am over here in one of Flav421's secret
chambers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pulled out Pachamama, blown by Corey
Cotnum and Stratisphere Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check them both out on Instagram,
at Corey Glass and at Stratisphere Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: This piece is unbelievable, not sure if
you can see the leaf, but it's got a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful spinning cannabis leaf,
and it also has a nice little spinner down
[SPEAKER_02]: on the bottom here, at about the halfway
point in the pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got these two spinners, and I think
we're gonna go in for a lovely dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a piece that you do not pick up,
but you hit it while it sits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, as tasty as it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you've got Swiss Tsunami,
with some of the raws in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: purple candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's green crack God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then purple candy bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then purple candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is all West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn it around so we can see inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I dipped it in the Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sour Tsunami, and now you're about
to rip that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corey Cottonum ripping the Pachamama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can someone please spin that thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
