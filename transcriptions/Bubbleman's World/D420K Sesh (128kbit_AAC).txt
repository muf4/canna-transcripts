low low dab low temp dab off the courts
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, it's always nice get a better
toke a nice with nicer rep It seems and
[SPEAKER_01]: you always know when you hit it,
right is because it won't turn black on
[SPEAKER_01]: your nail It'll kind of stay like the low
temp dabs really don't go black on the
[SPEAKER_01]: nail that really And is something that's
gonna happen when you've got your nail
[SPEAKER_01]: heated up much Much hotter than say 800
degrees or so seven or eight hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure when it's glowing orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's twelve or fourteen hundred degrees
I'm not sure of the exact temperatures as
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use a torch super often,
but Awesome.

Vancouver session Pretty beautiful day

overly cold so Beautiful day Yeah,

have a little bit of a whistle to them
[SPEAKER_01]: Slinger always made a good whistling pipe
tell you that marble slinger can blow some
[SPEAKER_01]: nice glass Miss having them on this side
of the world miss having them up in this
[SPEAKER_01]: country used to have incredible access to
glass back then as much earlier days,
[SPEAKER_01]: but definitely Miss having sling in the
area getting miss having you know getting
[SPEAKER_01]: to see him and hang out with him on the
daily on the daily Go down at that angle

[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that was damn near perfect it was
good good taste on that Very nice near 30
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good Shout out to the West Coast
concentrate guys puffing on their hash as
[SPEAKER_00]: always We've been trying to hook up and
have a sesh since I've been down We always
[SPEAKER_00]: do hmm good guys always down for a good
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get just fucking baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Love it indeed You down for a rosin rip
yep, you bet Already for
[SPEAKER_01]: you quite a bit of stuff going on Around
us there's a lot of people just in the
[SPEAKER_01]: downtown core area walking around back and
forth suits over here Worker dudes over
[SPEAKER_01]: here everyone in between It's pretty chill
Vancouver's always been a chill city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never felt like Like I'm really doing
anything wrong You know you don't look
[SPEAKER_01]: around like you're worried about someone
seeing you because it's just nobody really
[SPEAKER_01]: cares at all It's not really an issue It's
a very puff friend City I guess I would go
[SPEAKER_01]: out and say I would be very surprised to
see someone come up to the window and say
[SPEAKER_01]: hey What do you think you're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly why I'm gonna fuck off well
you probably would it's easy for us to
[SPEAKER_01]: though You know obviously the only illegal
part of this at this point in time would
[SPEAKER_01]: us be driving away after hitting the dabs
I'm looking forward to more tests being
[SPEAKER_01]: done and people maybe being able to even
go in for a test where you Get tested at
[SPEAKER_01]: the DMV under the influence of cannabis
just to make sure that you can drive That
[SPEAKER_01]: way I myself know that I can but I
certainly don't need to go push it so I
[SPEAKER_01]: usually just go for a little walk after we
have a session like this and Come back
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards and drive away, but sitting in
our car in this area Puffing our meds
[SPEAKER_01]: which we both have federal licenses for I
would say is definitely a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: legal Might throw the cops off if they
were to drive by and see it assuming that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were probably gonna be driving away
right afterwards they might have a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with that, but We're not knowing that we
have our licenses, and we are medicating
[SPEAKER_00]: they could just look at us like some
fucking bong rip and punks, and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what the bottom line is the bong rip rip
and punks and the license medicated
[SPEAKER_01]: license the license for medicating They're
both the same thing other than one is a
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective that it's okay because it's
legal and you have permission from a
[SPEAKER_01]: special group of self-interest people
agenda Versus the other people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: just like I'm just doing this because I
know it's not morally or Ethically wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna enjoy this so and it's
unfortunate that the police harassed that
[SPEAKER_00]: type as well, but it should be just You
know oh look at those bong rip and punks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about it look at those young guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I could have a talk
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, just around the bushes there
just over by North Vancouver across the
[SPEAKER_01]: water jump on the sea bus Good fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna finish it off with one last
dab rosin and then Well, maybe we'll take
[SPEAKER_01]: them for a little boot over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be the end of it right here
It's been hard to get off my ass and
[SPEAKER_01]: motivate to filming videos to go visit
gardens to go You know make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just I've got to get I've got to get
re motivated I've been fairly busy doing
[SPEAKER_01]: other things, but I will try my best and
