[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys back at the room here,
and I just want to hit a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: this gorilla glue Which is I have to say
very much like glue trying to get it off
[SPEAKER_04]: of The piece there was ridiculous So now
I'm going to hold the camera take the dab
[SPEAKER_04]: and film the whole thing All for you guys
here on bubble man's world
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely One more happy customer leaving
with bubble bags, I don't know I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them in Jamaica, but it's not I
wanted to keep the drive
[SPEAKER_01]: Strictly sense in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you so humble I don't smoke the
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't grumble
[SPEAKER_03]: Strictly sense media So mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb must be burned like your teeth must
be cleaned
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see Jesus dude, those are like about
to pop I know So dr. Feel-good Tony
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene, it's gonna hook mr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Castle up
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the unorthodox when the healing
when they when the healing needs to occur
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes that's how it goes down And
there's our 31 degrees Just like that Holy
[SPEAKER_05]: Mo Jess So what's it feel like in your
mind Because it was But so itchy pulling
[SPEAKER_05]: your So what do we got there five five
drops of p2 So this is an inactive
[SPEAKER_05]: full-spectrum sublingual just keep it in
your mouth Then We're going to take an
[SPEAKER_05]: accurate It really does go on nice hey You
get another half there that you can use
[SPEAKER_04]: Which obviously just means that it's been
heated so it's active THC or CBN or CBD or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever the active High CBD low THC So
[SPEAKER_05]: why the inactive or a broader spectrum so
instead of just like when you smoke a
[SPEAKER_05]: joint you're just Essentially lighting
something on fire
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing CBD is going to stop it I'm
telling you all this these five CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: restraints Like AC DCR for our tsunami
Swiss combination of strains put together
[SPEAKER_05]: so you give it like the full full spectrum
effect so that sublingual will respond
[SPEAKER_05]: going to the blood and I'll respond with
the lock and key System for the
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got your CB 1 CB 2 and we'll
teach So if you eat it it's differently so
[SPEAKER_05]: it was capsule forms, okay, and that has
plethora of CB 2 receptors If you put it
[SPEAKER_05]: as a sublingual, it's a direct ping on the
CB 1 receptor The sublingual is for a
[SPEAKER_05]: central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm trying to do is say hey,
we've put that stuff on He's hitting that
[SPEAKER_05]: receptor and saying pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have something wrong in the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the endocannabinoid system is
Working properly doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiencies in future body homeostasis So
that's what we're trying to do here We're
[SPEAKER_05]: using this as a signaling system to
communicate with us to see if we can help
[SPEAKER_05]: the information going under control May or
may not work, but that's how I would use
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis You put that transdermal gel,
yeah, what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the CBD A.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to lock it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is gonna lock it in it's gonna be
a transdermal it's gonna push full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum CBDA inactive and CBN It sure
felt good when I put it on my burn this
[SPEAKER_04]: morning It cooled right down and then it
felt like it was like Like I couldn't even
[SPEAKER_04]: feel the wind or any like when my shirt
touched it It felt like it was just like a
[SPEAKER_04]: little thin membrane of protection It's
pretty sweet it stays on so ideally you're
[SPEAKER_05]: supposed to do it like this Straight on
right here and then what that does is it
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves a little gel So just kind of do it
once and it leaves like a nice so I call
[SPEAKER_05]: it a gel and then that's transdermal so it
absorbs into your skin That's good,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep putting more on there if you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should definitely calm it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were to use cannabis for what you
just told me, that's what I would use.
[SPEAKER_04]: 130 in the morning tonight Kelly's gonna
be banging on the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude I'm trying to get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff's itching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got any of that cream?

[SPEAKER_04]: Have you gone in the water at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah the salt water make it feel good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I was gonna say I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I would take my arms out of the
water just about the water in my shadow
[SPEAKER_04]: and allow the air to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe like aloe.
