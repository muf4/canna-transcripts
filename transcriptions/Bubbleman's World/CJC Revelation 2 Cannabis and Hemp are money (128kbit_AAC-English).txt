[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome back to the
Cannabis Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did just drop you one little gem here
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Allen has another few revelations that
he wants to share with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Allen, without further ado,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows this, but no one will say
it, that cannabis and hemp are,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you legalize cannabis or hemp,
in your state, money will come to your
[SPEAKER_00]: state in one of two fashions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the citizens can grow, the money will
come to the citizens and they will spend
[SPEAKER_00]: the money inside the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the citizens are not allowed to grow,
then out-of-state cannabis cartel carpet
[SPEAKER_00]: bagger companies will come to the state
and extort the citizens and spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: money outside of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let the people grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll change your economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for that little tidbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be back soon with more Cannabis
Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
