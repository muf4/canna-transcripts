[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, hola.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine and you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent, happy to be here at
headquarters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the H-Food family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have your car here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very much, love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: An extreme place, beauty, delight and
happiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are leaders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Tony, you ready to head in there
with me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're going to put some credit on
your card?
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so here at HQ they use these
little cards and you top up your money
[SPEAKER_05]: with them and that's how you spend inside
with your drinks and your beers and your
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis or your hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're going to check in right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eduardo.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, welcome to HQ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to see you here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to our club.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, it's a beautiful club.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to take us through?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's something different.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to create a good space with a good
menu, with a good service.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a new place.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's 2.0 associated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the toilet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice big doors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the glass roof.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, people in the chairs.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming through here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful pool table.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got this one in Russia?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful, so organic juices, teas,
espresso, coffees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just happened to have John B.
[SPEAKER_05]: at the bar with Tony V.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys getting something good?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to head down with Eduardo and
finish the tour.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have good beers too, from Muni,
from Ireland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, so you guys are doing a nice
microbe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to be leaders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always leaders, not dealers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a nice selection of beers.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the biggest space to be chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, gyms in Big Buddha.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is David,
[SPEAKER_05]: the president.
[SPEAKER_05]: The president.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome place, David.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got the name right.
We have
[SPEAKER_08]: our product here.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the stuff is from us.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it smell, Luis?
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells very interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very Sativa looking bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the bottom of the stash at the
moment, but it looks very Sativa traits,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least from how we like to call cannabis
in different numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to work with American genetics,
with pure Sativas, with genetics from
[SPEAKER_08]: Africa, so something different that you
can't find in another association.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very tasty, fruity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know what I want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is bubble hash on their menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble hash is from shishka berry as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's ice wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ice wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble hash, bubble hash, bubble hash,
bubble wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the African blends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Golden Tiger, Malawi.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: San Fernando Valley, Ojukush.
[SPEAKER_06]: San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_06]: With a purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got some African blend bubble hash
on the menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony, I was thinking maybe check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some pretty nice herb here at HQ so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen some exotic Sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got some bubble hash and the
African blend.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got their Golden Tiger.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got some shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty happy, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always nice when you can tell someone
the quality of their place is really a
[SPEAKER_05]: quality place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not just making it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like space in here to breathe is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have good beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pool table is quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk in the door, you just know the
place is quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: You picked the right name.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_05]: You picked the right name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to walk around and check this
place out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Checking out the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: HQ.
[SPEAKER_05]: So should we get the bomb out and buy some
of these?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and I'll shoot some of them too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a gram of each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what you mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really quality right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You seeing that on the screen,
Tony?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of has that white texture to it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jibz is off to pull out the D-nail or
the mothership at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: A quote from him was, that hash is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to get some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the tropical sativa?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, only sativas this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that one is a golden tiger and
malawi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys serious?
[SPEAKER_05]: He also said he had like a kilo of butt if
he wanted to play around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try some.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, this one or the HQ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, that one right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even a question, that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try half a gram of this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony is buying half grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: These things are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking on that full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see if I'm done with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Africanas.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 euros a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: 25 euros a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful red color.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my card,
[SPEAKER_06]: brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's your card?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: My personal card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the if not available.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a very detailed man, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because life is full of details.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it's all in the details.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I just finished photographing the
absolutely beautiful samples found here at
[SPEAKER_05]: HQ in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: The weed menu has golden tiger,
100% sativa, which I believe was 16 or 15
euros.
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 weeks of bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the cantaloupe haze,
the strawberry cough, the super silver
[SPEAKER_05]: haze, the amnesia, white widow,
shishka berry, which I was very impressed
[SPEAKER_05]: to see on the menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mango with a mazari across,
Tahoe OG Kush, San Fernando Valley Purple
[SPEAKER_05]: OG Kush, a San Fernando Valley OG Kush,
a Karma Twin, and then they have some
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-rolled joints that they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my favorite, the bubble hashes,
they've got HQ mix, kind of what I call a
[SPEAKER_05]: lucky day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The African blend, which I believe is a
malawi, seski, and what was the name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Malawi, golden tiger, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden tiger and seski.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally they have the super
silver haze, bubble hash as well as bubble
[SPEAKER_05]: wax, which is also an ice wax,
shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I myself am getting a gram of the
African blend and a gram of the super
[SPEAKER_05]: silver haze, so pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great color on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to have some African exotic flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love the idea of the cards, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine's covered in resin, of course,
but there's no surprise there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, these guys are working it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eduardo, Diana, very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys have a classy little setup
here, a nice little window.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out what they got going on there,
it's very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here's my African blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, the super silver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, very nice, thank you, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great color on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for us to get puffin',
so we'll catch up with you in a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just got to HQ in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely impeccable place, run by the
president, David, and a good friend,
[SPEAKER_05]: Eduardo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Met him through Facebook, bubble
ambassador, really trying to step up his
[SPEAKER_05]: skills with water extraction, and it's
sort of where we connected.
[SPEAKER_05]: He invited me to come down on our trip
while we were here for the spanovis to
[SPEAKER_05]: check out some hash making and of course
check out the quality of their place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you have a place called HQ,
high quality, you expect good things,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have to say, so far I'm pretty
impressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to take you in here right
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: John Berfalo for Puff Wednesdays is in
there already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony's filming for River Rock and for our
documentary that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Jibz is in there helping Edu and
David to make the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't we check it out, guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the place, really nice and open
venue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful pool table.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the back bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: This place is selling sick micro-brews.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to get yourself a beer,
you don't have to drink crap.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually get yourself a nice beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me this Lager Bier of Hell was
actually bottled three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the size of the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ booth, they've got it nice and empty
for us right now because we're actually
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be making some hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there's David.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man, right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take us in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's check out what these guys are up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is what I wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edu, Jibz, John, in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And tell us a little bit about this little
thing that you came up with here,
[SPEAKER_05]: Edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something mixed, machine,
handmade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same movement like machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but by hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think it's better because you
don't break the butt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I got to say, I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, it's more clear, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put it all in work bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 15 years, in 15 years, I've never seen
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put it in the machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: 220 bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here we are on Puff Wednesdays,
John, just whipping up a batch with the
[SPEAKER_05]: boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we're thinking of running,
we've got super silver haze, but we also
[SPEAKER_05]: have this five month cured strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glass jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely the quality is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like they've given us a low
quality herb to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love their motto right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are leaders.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got our spray bottle nearby.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got our bags set up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tools of the trade are in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's see this mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guys, bubble man here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just got into HQ and these guys are mixing
up a batch of bubble hash in a way that
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got to say, it's pretty
ingenious.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a hamper loaded into a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess the hamper's got all the holes
in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's put the pyramid bags with his ice and
all his material inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it allows him to move the entire
mixture up, up and down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you guys lift it and turn it
simultaneously?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the lift and turn like he's got that
process where he's lifting it about a foot
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when did you come up with this idea?
[SPEAKER_08]: I created this because one day I need to
find a process to produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: material.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't have the machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one Sunday I went to the Chinese shop
to see what I can create.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see this and I start to create my
new system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just appears from a Chinese shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The simplicity is what makes it ingenious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very simple and it's not something
that if someone else wants to try,
[SPEAKER_05]: they have to put a massive investment of
time and energy and money into.
[SPEAKER_05]: People will go and do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the most important is to find a way to
don't break the material.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't break the material,
you have a clean product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the most important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed he did something.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was drinking the water and tasting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did he taste it for?
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to see if it's clean or if it's not
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to see the
[SPEAKER_08]: color, if it's clean or if it's not clean
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clean water and it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little can of tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bringing back the community aspect of
hash making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheap and nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking a wooden spoon or this,
I'd definitely go with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already figuring out a way how we can
put something across the middle,
[SPEAKER_05]: like the way that spoon is right there,
but just somehow mounted just across the
[SPEAKER_05]: top of it so when you turn it,
the spoon just does a motion.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only thing I would see what
he's doing with the spoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good idea to add.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know those drywall mixers with a
drill bit with a rod and a square?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that, but it's smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get it in between them all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have to get a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeeze a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I must have turned it off after I turned
it on.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so he's just pulled out the
bags and put them into the back bucket and
[SPEAKER_05]: now he's draining out his ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great way to preserve ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ice preservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another bucket right beside him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a whole little system here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are in Barcelona making bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble hash, the winner of the first,
second, and third prize at this year's
[SPEAKER_05]: Fanavis, with Javier for medical seeds
taking first with his very nice bubble
[SPEAKER_05]: hash, Soma seeds taking second,
and Ripper seeds taking third.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no,
[SPEAKER_05]: someone took second at Davidew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it can go with everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use that Russian strength.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stay at the Krasnopolsky in Amsterdam
every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for whatever reason, when I stay at
the Krasnopolsky, I end up speaking like
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Russian for the whole trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, no, straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always making the same joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, keep it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will order up meat grinder and put you
through toilet in like half hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where you live, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm less worried about the temperature
in here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: At Javier's at medical seeds, he pulled
all the bags out of the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's one of the issues with the
bags getting very dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second they were over above 70
degrees, that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took all the bags out of the water
and leaned them up against in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, and then he squeezed
it in the bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeezing it in the bag is where he lost
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he also said that he wasn't used to
using fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he couldn't believe how sticky it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a learning curve there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Change the variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you will change your results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will change your techniques as a
result.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a white chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you just pull the bags one by one and
clean them out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how do you do it for me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of curious to see your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do it with your own water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, John, why don't you take a dab out of
our new little rig?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a puff one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to be puffing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to hit some zombie kush?
[SPEAKER_05]: Zombie from Ripper?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I'm telling you, it's kind of like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let them decide.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think of this quality?
[SPEAKER_05]: Decent or?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I'm going to offer John
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little zombie kush from David.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very kick ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smells great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what's great about this little dome
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes seconds to eat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to see how he does it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I told him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet little hitman little perk here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to dab me up there, my friend?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll dab you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're older guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can barely see this bloody dome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm getting blind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like blinding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_05]: 3, 2, 1.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Barcelona, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an epic day today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our best sled Wednesday we've had.
[SPEAKER_06]: But save this for anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should save that for uh.
[SPEAKER_05]: You always save it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean you don't save it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Throwing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't throw it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, there's people that have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people that are smoking wood and
resin sold by Iranians on the street at
night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we know all about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we bought some street stuff
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to see it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fucking.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's pulled out his 190 bag and he's just
spraying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Down with the sprayer, pulling the hash
down into the center.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you aren't doing this, what he's doing
is he's cleaning the screen and at the
[SPEAKER_05]: same time collecting the resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, move out of the.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the rim of your hat is making it
a shadow.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another good thing this can do,
especially in a place like Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: This could have been helpful yesterday was
taking the bags out of the water and
[SPEAKER_05]: letting the resin dry for any amount of
time can be a very bad idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is a great way to
re-moisturize the hash before you pull it
[SPEAKER_05]: off the screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more water that's in this hash,
the easier and the nicer it will come off
[SPEAKER_05]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we allow it to get warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, can I ever smell that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy Christ.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget about the 190.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've moved on to the 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've completely avoided the 160.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is actually the real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre 2005 or four, when we came up with the
90 micron bag, the 90 always went into the
[SPEAKER_05]: 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now old school guys that don't use 90
micron bags like yourselves, you call this
[SPEAKER_05]: the real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you sell this on your menu,
you can seriously put the real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it helps educate people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll say, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll say, well, there's supposed to
be a 90 micron bag in the set,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the quality of that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they've done with this is they
went from the 190, I mean the 90,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 120, and the 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chips is working over here on the 160.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little spray tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: How have you been feeling about the hash
making here in Spain, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit different when you don't
have your lab, you don't have your tools,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't have the same geographic region
with humidity and moisture content.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in school it was an experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great to see everybody's
individual techniques and how they adapt
[SPEAKER_03]: to their individual climate and
environments and what they have on hand
[SPEAKER_03]: and being able to apply that information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And learning things and being able to give
other people hints that they might be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to use to improve their techniques as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's more and more
continuing what we're all learning and
[SPEAKER_03]: striving for, being able to pass
information back to each other between
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody so we can all improve the level
of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to realize when we're on Facebook
that we're from all over the world and
[SPEAKER_05]: that when you start traveling and meeting
cool people and making hash with them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you realize these things that we're
realizing, these variables that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: coming across, the sort of doing the best
that I can with what I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just nice to see that we can take
that back to the drawing extraction room
[SPEAKER_05]: and some of these other water extraction
rooms and explain to people that look,
[SPEAKER_05]: not everyone's in North Cal, not
everyone's in Arizona, not everyone's in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people all over the world doing
this and we have to generalize the
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone can kind of use that
information and come up with the
[SPEAKER_05]: techniques that work best for them,
for where they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got some 45 there?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's full, just not working.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold diggers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't do shit with gold.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gold panning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're panning for gold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck man, it's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably because it's at such an
angle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's got to be almost down,
probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, put that at an angle and keep that
so it's pointing down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so you use a spoon,
you collect all the resin, nice and
[SPEAKER_05]: gentle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did you notice I burnt your pressing
screen?
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a little hole in your pressing
screen with hash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send you a nice new one in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, luckily, all the people have
done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send him probably like a stack of 10
or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I put a hole in your pressing
screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not advocate this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always just good to be cool about
things rather than not cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, once again, I'm digging his
little process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how he's got all his little bags
pulled out and it's 120 microns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Danny, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: I met you both the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one looks good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd say you have more than three
grams, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably like the five to six
range.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just the one that we just pulled out
was three grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's the 73 right there is five to
six grams.
Easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see all the bags lined up in a
row in these buckets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a Volkswagen van.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just works whenever it wants to.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's drawing, writing his numbers down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We showed Javier yesterday about parchment
just on top of the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was liking that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He made these little trays where he sort
of folded up the ends like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the ends so it made like almost like a
little box.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can try it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Chibs isn't on that cardboard tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to, you know, make him feel
like I don't want to be on a video where
[SPEAKER_05]: these motherfuckers are using cardboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just use that clip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chibs isn't on that cardboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, you got to know,
like here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, straight up this.
[SPEAKER_05]: He not only used cardboard, he put he puts
it in a jar once it's all planed out and
[SPEAKER_05]: powdered and kind of dry in a sealed thing
like this with desiccant balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those little desiccants like the same
thing they put in the seeds, otherwise the
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds will sprout.
[SPEAKER_05]: Javier told me if he doesn't put those in
the seeds, they'll sprout.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact of like long term having to store
ash with a decadent ball in it just
[SPEAKER_03]: because the natural climate is so humid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, but at the same time,
it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is perfectly dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, it is dark from oxidization
and that has to do with how long it takes
[SPEAKER_03]: to dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be so hard to keep hash a light
color here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was amazed that they had that chisca
berry that was that light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially this is outdoor, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Lisa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I met I met Tony and I was like,
look, I'm going to have a surgery on my
[SPEAKER_03]: neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain to me how I'm going to do this
with nothing but cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, well, tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: That comes out easy to make stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also if you leave all the bags,
inside the buckets in the water,
[SPEAKER_05]: another one of my tricks is when you scoop
the hash off of that screen and you put it
[SPEAKER_05]: over there, I clean that screen inside the
next bucket in the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of important, too,
because it's valuable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Puff Wednesday hash making at HQ
here is almost done for us, but it's been
[SPEAKER_05]: a blast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to come back and do some dry
sifting a little later on tonight because
[SPEAKER_05]: we didn't get our screens in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to dry sift up this strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully we'll come back and have a
dab or two of this super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It absolutely looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sativa fudge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for showing your techniques with us
and definitely thank Jibs for once again
[SPEAKER_05]: busting it out as a hard worker that he
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it was great having us here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to John for showing some new techs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Danny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, always the biggest props to the
grower hash makers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget your grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're helping make the resin quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: All we can do is purify it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quality plus purity equals full mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
