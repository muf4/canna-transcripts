[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a very early morning here in bubble
man's world about seven o'clock in the
[SPEAKER_06]: morning just woke up at about 630 and I'm
happy to inform all of you guys that we
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to see the great gardener today
we're gonna head on over to Vancouver
[SPEAKER_06]: Island and we're gonna make our way over
to see him and he's apparently got all
[SPEAKER_06]: sorts of fun things for us to check out
he's Got multiple seed crops that he's had
[SPEAKER_06]: drying for weeks that are ready to deseed
and and turn into hash so we're always
[SPEAKER_06]: happy to be there for that he's got some
other crops I believe in bloom I'm not
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly sure of what flowering period that
will be seen but it's always a pleasure to
[SPEAKER_06]: talk with Matt he's always got a lot of
information so I figured we get this video
[SPEAKER_06]: started out the right way bubble man style
by finding a bong rip so this could be
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting there's my lighter from the
greenhouse it's probably the only one I
[SPEAKER_06]: have I don't use lighters very often these
days and then I gotta grab a little
[SPEAKER_06]: beeline I'm gonna grab a little of the
full melt bubble or dry sift got a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit left on the card here remember when
your dry sift is stable it's not a big
[SPEAKER_06]: deal to turn it upside down you're not
gonna lose your stuff all right we're
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna pull out the Swiss perk today
because I have packed the mothership all
[SPEAKER_06]: right quick little rip I'm not sure how
much I'm gonna you know spend time on the
[SPEAKER_06]: ferry videotaping it in the car and
whatnot today I've had a lot of complaints
[SPEAKER_06]: over the over the videos that I show too
much stuff that's not really exciting to
[SPEAKER_06]: see but I'm gonna show I'm gonna try and
see some good stuff off the coast of the
[SPEAKER_06]: ferry and then we'll get right to it and
we'll get right to Matt's and we'll get
[SPEAKER_06]: right to filming
[SPEAKER_06]: Swiss perk rips thank to Nate thanks to
Nate Dizzle dude I'll never forget this
[SPEAKER_06]: gift it's one of my favorite pipes and I
still use it almost daily thanks again
[SPEAKER_06]: Nate beautiful you know as I sit here I
notice this jar of greased out full melt
[SPEAKER_06]: it's probably a couple of years old oh
yeah I think we're gonna bring that and
[SPEAKER_06]: puff it with Matt I think he might enjoy
that so why don't you guys pull up a seat
[SPEAKER_06]: we've got at least an hour going here for
the first part I'm gonna try and film
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple parts pull up a seat grab your
bong roll up a joint or whatever it is
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're going to enjoy during this
video and let's get this baby started all
[SPEAKER_06]: right it was a nasty miserable morning out
there this morning but you know what we
[SPEAKER_06]: live in a rainforest and we require a
certain amount of water for our trees to
[SPEAKER_06]: stay as big and healthy as they are so we
smile on days like today the ferry will be
[SPEAKER_06]: unique and for whatever reason there'll be
a higher percentage of seeing whales or
[SPEAKER_06]: dolphins with in this sort of fallish
weather I might have just made that
[SPEAKER_06]: statistic up but I'm standing by it
[SPEAKER_01]: the purpose of the weed that keeps me
going the purpose of the weed to the mine
[SPEAKER_01]: the purpose of the weed gave by this
expression the purpose of the weed let
[SPEAKER_01]: time fuel the time weed is not here to
trick the mine it is only here to do its
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose of time ganja is not here to trick
the mine it is only here to do its purpose
[SPEAKER_01]: of time
[SPEAKER_06]: hey guys I am now down in my truck on the
ferry here I've left my driver up to enjoy
[SPEAKER_06]: some breakfast and I figured I would come
down have a little session and yeah it's
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of miserable out there on the deck
I'll show you guys a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_06]: the ocean as we get closer we'll hopefully
keep our eyes peeled out for any type of
[SPEAKER_06]: wildlife out there but I figured it was
time to come inside have a few rips and
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my trippy stick haven't seen my
trippy stick in a while so I figured I'd
[SPEAKER_06]: pull this out an old the old standby
really I mean it's a nice and small slick
[SPEAKER_06]: little unit got the green button and
[SPEAKER_06]: trippy sticks anyway that was the end of
that particular batch of it was some type
[SPEAKER_06]: of a hash plant that was in there there's
definitely sift you can always tell the
[SPEAKER_06]: sift as opposed to the bubs and other even
you know finger rub or whatnot they
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely have very specific tastes all
right so we got a little bit of sweet
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk sorry you're not gonna be able to
really see that properly don't have the
[SPEAKER_06]: best light here in the truck just a little
tag to get some out nice beautiful sift
[SPEAKER_06]: from a great friend a great friend that
I'm on my way to see who could my great
[SPEAKER_06]: friend be going to the island he's great
I'm sure you guys know who it is I'm not
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna say till we get there
[SPEAKER_06]: oh yeah that sweet skunk for those of you
that know what it's a very wonderful resin
[SPEAKER_06]: lemony sativa spicy light yet it has
substance hard to explain really grabs you
[SPEAKER_06]: in the back of the throat yet it's a very
light enjoyable smoke that you could
[SPEAKER_06]: almost just smoke because it's so darn
tasty
[SPEAKER_06]: now this being a trippy stick I for sure
could have gotten away with walking around
[SPEAKER_06]: up top and taking rips of this in which
case I'll probably do right now but I just
[SPEAKER_06]: thought I'd come down to the to the truck
have a little session break up the driving
[SPEAKER_06]: portion of the trip because well we have a
little bit more we still have a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: of a drive once we've landed and of course
I'm gonna share a little bit of it with
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys and then we will be at my great
friend's place and I've got a good show
[SPEAKER_06]: for you guys so stay tuned
[SPEAKER_06]: all the men here I finally got to you
guessed it the house of the great gardener
[SPEAKER_06]: so why don't we go in and see what Matt's
up to
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah this room looks great yeah I can see
that
[SPEAKER_03]: any nicknames on your new strain yeah
we're gonna call it we're bidding like
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's nice I like the way you prop
them up here pop them in the right way
[SPEAKER_02]: there's gonna be nice flowering bushes
they're a lot taller growing way faster
[SPEAKER_03]: than the gong of these so try to keep them
at bay I have that in the next group let's
[SPEAKER_03]: go there this middle table here is the
seat cbd Rene and then cbd Afghani now
[SPEAKER_03]: we're just now we're just sort of
fine-tuning we have all the phenotypes
[SPEAKER_03]: that are hot the cbd Rene seems to be
pretty popular and the cbd sweet scum is
[SPEAKER_03]: super popular just in the flavor profiles
and then having the cbd intermixed in
[SPEAKER_06]: there right off the bat I want to
congratulate you on your canopy these are
[SPEAKER_06]: awesome I mean the other room is great
this is just more great I love the fact
[SPEAKER_06]: that even on with the tables and whatnot
coming right up almost to the six foot
[SPEAKER_03]: range here we're just about to put the
first layer of nets on I'm saying it's
[SPEAKER_03]: nice that you have your big tall roof
that's for certain so this room it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering for maybe a week ten days not
even that one more under cleaning maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: two more under cleanings to go as the
structure grows up it will come in and
[SPEAKER_06]: clear out the underneath airflow I'll tell
you both the Afghani cbd and the Rene cbd
[SPEAKER_06]: have that just rank stalk smell that's
great and this one's digweed I'll be right
[SPEAKER_06]: back and I'll tell you it's always a
pleasure to come to the house of the great
[SPEAKER_06]: gardener and get to hang out with
beautiful healthy plants
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll end up putting the nets on and then
we'll end up putting side netting on just
[SPEAKER_03]: off the sides so it'll catch it'll catch
all these ones because as soon as these
[SPEAKER_03]: start getting buds on them you just put
the side net on and catch them
[SPEAKER_06]: take these guys for a walk through the
garden here
[SPEAKER_06]: the great things are coming over the house
of the great gardener is the back of their
[SPEAKER_06]: garden always looks as good as the front
of their garden they pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole garden and you can really tell that
by just how healthy the plants are and how
[SPEAKER_06]: happy they are I'm comfortable in this
room I've got my method 7 glasses on which
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely reduces the light sensitivity
of my eyes but temperature wise it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: comfortable room I can spend time in here
and not complain and you can kind of tell
[SPEAKER_06]: the plants feel the same way about it
these are your nets right here?
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, these will be the first of the area
we hang around the ceiling so they're a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit vulnerable okay, is this where
we hang them on?
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, it's covering down, wire them in
they're susceptible to sort of sway like
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll keep your plants up but if the whole
canopy decides to start moving then we
[SPEAKER_03]: start staking it up and stuff so there's
supposedly a new system coming one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: guys is developing a more rigid system and
we're still waiting to see that so you're
[SPEAKER_03]: that guy, waiting look it up!
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, it looks great in here man absolutely
stoked to see this one flower off
[SPEAKER_06]: just cleaning up the screen with Matt
Baron as you can see you can make your own
[SPEAKER_06]: screens you can buy the screen wholesale
online you can make wood frames they are
[SPEAKER_06]: available if you're too lazy you can go
check out freshheadies.com and we'll just
[SPEAKER_06]: sell them to you but you always have your
options so here we are at the shaker I
[SPEAKER_03]: like it this thing is again homemade 140
micron so close to 100 lines per inch
[SPEAKER_03]: there's an 80 back there but we use the
100 all the time and you've got it fit
[SPEAKER_06]: into this thing don't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, I don't know if you can see that
yeah you guys can see that he's got a
[SPEAKER_06]: piece of plywood that's blackened on one
side a nice and smooth surface and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: raised and then the whole screen just fits
right in this is going to be key right on
[SPEAKER_06]: top of this one quite an important factor
in this particular system this one yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: well like once I turn it on you will see
you'll see that this is not your average
[SPEAKER_06]: industrial sifter this thing is the shaker
the shaker so tell the audience tell the
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube people out there where you found
such a device it was actually a company it
[SPEAKER_03]: was a it was an auction and it was all
medical supplies so they use they use
[SPEAKER_03]: these for keeping solution constantly
moving so I was I sort of saw it right
[SPEAKER_03]: away I was like I can turn that into like
a sifter so a lab tool vibrating a
[SPEAKER_03]: vibrating sifter put a screen put a screen
on top and it it'll sort of do the work
[SPEAKER_03]: for you so I started bidding I looked up
online how much of these things cost and
[SPEAKER_03]: there were $3,000 it's $3,000 for one of
these units so the bidding starts is like
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 20 50 100 150 I put my hand up and then
the room goes quiet sold to the gentleman
[SPEAKER_03]: for $150 oh man like I bought two that was
crazy and then I think the word went out
[SPEAKER_03]: because the next day because the auction
went on for a couple days the next day all
[SPEAKER_03]: of a sudden whole bunch of people started
showing up and by the end of the auction
[SPEAKER_03]: the shakers were going for like 800 a
piece well I will say I did get that call
[SPEAKER_06]: I was invited but I never made it down to
the auction but luckily you know there's
[SPEAKER_03]: that one there's there's this one here I
got this one for like this is like a even
[SPEAKER_06]: a smaller one oh yeah the VWR which name
what we got on their scientific orbital
[SPEAKER_06]: orbital shaker you can Google that up
shaker this one's from L troll electronics
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's actually a BC address and phone
number for services yeah it was a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: company man there's there's so much stuff
we got what we got here so can't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: shaker demo without something to shake
yeah so you got a couple of grams here we
[SPEAKER_03]: got the CBD Renee seeded crop we're gonna
shake it I'll forever call this one Renee
[SPEAKER_06]: BD Wow that's really nice give you guys a
little little close-up on that so you can
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: and use and this is see you feel you can
hear the seed in the bottom already oh
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't that just a wonderful thing not for
ten minutes two minutes one minute
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever what's the number signify on the
screen 198 so that's rpm so right now it's
[SPEAKER_03]: at 198 rpm we went through we went through
all kinds of tasks using different rpm
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think it it goes up to 50 300 oh
yeah amazing that the bud is all staying
[SPEAKER_06]: in the middle like it's neat that's a
little crazy we like to get a little crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: here at the house of the great gardener
all kinds of experiments on what rpm works
[SPEAKER_03]: the best
[SPEAKER_03]: we found right around 200 rpms excellent
for how many minutes yeah we do you
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes we do it for a couple of minutes
just to do a really quick run yeah but if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're just doing a regular run you just
put the timer on for ten minutes and every
[SPEAKER_03]: ten minutes and you just sort of change
change it out so I don't know how long you
[SPEAKER_03]: think we've had it on right now for a
couple of minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always excited to come to the house of
the great gardener and play with new toys
[SPEAKER_05]: this is my first time using an orbital
shaker to you to make dry sift
[SPEAKER_06]: excellent scoop I'm sure someone watching
will say how dare he touch that beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine with his fingers sorry but yes
it's true people people touch your things
[SPEAKER_06]: we try to keep our fingers clean I'm just
gonna smoke it right away yes I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: join you actually no we were just we got
called out d4 20k and I got called out at
[SPEAKER_06]: our we went and did the med pot now
dispensary and we looked at some buds on
[SPEAKER_06]: camera and smell and people were just like
dude I noticed that too I was like I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: sorry the worker had gloves on for sure we
should have we should have kept the all
[SPEAKER_06]: the bud we touched and we're gonna do that
next time and just because you touch that
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll make sure we smoke it all I look at
it I look at it differently I look at it
[SPEAKER_03]: that that bud has now been enhanced by the
energy of whoever touched it I try to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: a clean hand but I understand too awesome
well let's do a little D now all right
[SPEAKER_06]: give a shot in this two-minute batch and
what was the strain again the CBD Renee oh
[SPEAKER_06]: wow it's got a definite like you can
actually press it into a dab
[SPEAKER_06]: dabble as the kids say these days
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought so as well that it was just a
little bit moist still but you know what
[SPEAKER_06]: get some great heads off of it you could
get away with sifting that in if it was
[SPEAKER_06]: winter and it was like minus 10 in here
all right let's see here we go a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of that Renee CBD cross
[SPEAKER_06]: this quality on that definitely dabble I
think I'll dab it right now
[SPEAKER_06]: how's that for a catch man
[SPEAKER_06]: is that tasty
[SPEAKER_03]: that one is that one in the sweet skunk I
mean that's insane it's candy different
[SPEAKER_03]: from Renee quite quite different from
Renee well the project the project was all
[SPEAKER_03]: about putting flavor it's always important
to do seed crops otherwise how would
[SPEAKER_03]: people have access to these great seeds
the great thing about the vibration
[SPEAKER_03]: machine also is that it releases all those
sort of seeds that are just ready to go it
[SPEAKER_06]: really does have a great flavor it's like
not going to escape me like this on this
[SPEAKER_06]: running yeah hold it up to your hand and
you kind of have to do a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_06]: trick to see the seed you kind of have to
go close yeah and then keep there we go
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah it's great nice-looking seed yeah CBD
Renee and CBD Renee will be available via
[SPEAKER_03]: the host of the great gardener newly at
Attitude seed bank Vancouver seed bank
[SPEAKER_03]: distributing now out of pure sativa in the
UK yeah man worked with those guys for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last 11 years yeah they're great guys so
yeah that's all new next one on the block
[SPEAKER_03]: is pure DNA out of South America Chile so
if anybody's down in Chile for the expo
[SPEAKER_03]: weed come talk to the great gardener booth
52 we'll be there are you coming yeah yes
[SPEAKER_06]: you should be coming I know I should be
coming I answered yes a little too early
[SPEAKER_06]: on that one I've got to go to Jamaica for
a conference a gold rush conference that
[SPEAKER_06]: our company CRD is doing there in November
and then I've got to be at the cup for
[SPEAKER_06]: legends and Davide and all these other
events and so I'm not sure I'm supposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: be in Africa Tony and head do and David
from HQ in Barcelona so I'm not sure I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna be able to make that one that's the
one sort of life's rough I know it's only
[SPEAKER_06]: seven hours from Jamaica but it ends up
being like 16 or 17 hours yeah from
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam yeah we're going to the expo
weed and then we're going to Amsterdam so
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see you in Amsterdam absolutely damn
is that nice the bud really is fruity
[SPEAKER_03]: fruity fruity
[SPEAKER_04]: you want one of these resin
[SPEAKER_06]: great bouquet on that hash nice color on
there too so that's that's ten minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: well I did bring the microscope so we can
play around and see what we got and we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: bring bring some over to absolutely well
we're gonna bring this over there and run
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna run the rest of it in the
tumbler excellent we just put it all in
[SPEAKER_03]: the tumbler all right so what have we here
this little section right here is the
[SPEAKER_06]: tangy tangy super fruity flavor DNA yeah
and is this all the same fino didn't you
[SPEAKER_03]: have like a purple tangy or something
terrible story oh that's just one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: I only had ten spots and I had twelve
plants so I took the two worst vegging
[SPEAKER_03]: ones out and then we flowered those two
just had them in the corner right the one
[SPEAKER_03]: turned out to be so fruity flavorful and
purple but it was a lot it was lost so
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a terrible mistake on my part but
still a beautiful fruity tangy fino
[SPEAKER_03]: nonetheless and the rest of the room here
is a can of tonic oh can of time high CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: nice even canopy there famous hot CBD
strain for sure the genetic that we used
[SPEAKER_06]: in our CBD line with the can of tonic okay
that looks nice and level canopy right
[SPEAKER_03]: there just got every other light lit in
here right now yeah once we flip it the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering bulbs will put all nine in but
mm-hmm just put six on for veg for now
[SPEAKER_03]: cool this one's over there a little floppy
but kind of top them off tangy all right
[SPEAKER_03]: so John Gee John Gee famous made in
Montreal clubs in Montreal in the house of
[SPEAKER_03]: the great gardener did a big genetic swap
with a lot of the major compassion clubs
[SPEAKER_03]: at the time what's working there what's
working here swapped it all up beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: John Gee for us but bringing it back was
potency John Gee is incredible yeah I've
[SPEAKER_06]: incredible painkiller I've only had the
bubs but it was strong every time we've
[SPEAKER_03]: tested it it comes in 20 plus THC the only
one we have that even comes close to that
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that everything else man I just put
the method sevens on and I'm feeling I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: feeling the relief do you not feel the
tension under the the thousand watt light
[SPEAKER_06]: bulbs yourself or you just spend so much
time under here you're good to go that's
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome built in built in that's right
yeah these ones are just getting probably
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe two or three more weeks hairs are
just starting to turn right notice that
[SPEAKER_06]: some of these hairs are an incredible
shape just like standing straight up
[SPEAKER_03]: we went through and be leafed it I think
it was just maybe a little bit too much
[SPEAKER_03]: but I always find those those moments are
the best you always find out good things
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely just wait and see what happens
this room is filled in so much there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole heck of a lot of resin in here nice
to see
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was like four minutes four
minutes great color and a real sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: nice marshmallowy consistency there's a
good percentage of heads in there what do
[SPEAKER_06]: you got afghan 73 that looks gooey you got
some sweet skunk 73 white yeah the sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk is crazy that one looks sieved Congo
90 micron yeah that's definitely sieved
[SPEAKER_06]: all right well hit one I think it's a must
Matt's gonna do that and in the background
[SPEAKER_06]: this is just gonna keep doing its thing
[SPEAKER_06]: which one did you hit the Afghani so nice
it's getting close to like a year old now
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe six months old that Afghani to me is
just so reminiscent of the old-school
[SPEAKER_06]: Romulan piney and tasty strong dense
little nuggets delicious yeah I'm down
[SPEAKER_03]: we're naming it house of the great
gardener is going to rename the Afghani
[SPEAKER_03]: we're changing it to the GG number one our
Afghani anyway we've had it for so long
[SPEAKER_03]: and then since we're coming to the
European market we just didn't want to use
[SPEAKER_03]: the term Afghani so because it's we've had
it so long we've crossed it so many times
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's no longer the original sort of
what it was right so just to do it justice
[SPEAKER_06]: and everybody got an Afghani true now
although in Europe I believe that you know
[SPEAKER_06]: it was back in the day anyway it was one
particular Afghani that was really
[SPEAKER_06]: responsible for the majority of those
Afghan crosses heard the old story of Dave
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing a thousand seeds to Amsterdam in
the 80s and having one Afghani pop and it
[SPEAKER_06]: was a female have to get him on camera one
day confirming that yeah I did see that
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that's insane found them on the
floor one day all dry damn dude look at
[SPEAKER_06]: that hold them up yeah like that what's up
guys on bubble man's world keep it real
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone needs a mascot all right I'm
ripping one of those
[SPEAKER_06]: wait a minute sweet skunk sweet skunk all
right filming all right I'm ready for the
[SPEAKER_03]: big oh look at that big dab of sweet skunk
73 micron microplane
[SPEAKER_06]: cured the taste on that is so good
although I'm telling you I'm I'm yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: that's good there's something else in
there too it's like the pipes been smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: like Renee something puffing Renee through
here I don't think so no all right well
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe I'll hit another rule Congo
oversized rips Congolese 90 micron sued 90
[SPEAKER_03]: micron exceptional exceptional resin
everybody this is an exciting spot isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: it this is a very exciting spot this is
going to be the future home of the house
[SPEAKER_03]: of the great gardener isolation cold
chamber the walk-in isolation room the
[SPEAKER_03]: walk-in cooler the freezer the fridge
every hash makers dream really once you
[SPEAKER_06]: start getting into dry sift and wet
washing to be able to have a room you know
[SPEAKER_06]: the coolness for wet washing isn't
necessarily the big component it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: it's for dry sifting it's key but for
breaking up wet wash if you're making
[SPEAKER_06]: bubble and now you're breaking it up and
wicking the moisture out of it so you can
[SPEAKER_06]: sieve it or microplane it sieving to me is
much easier in a cold yeah yeah for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't get stinker sure resin stays loose
and it's that this room is it's all going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be about when you take your stuff from
the freezer you have to pull it out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: freezer and it starts to warm up right
right like it's by the time you finish
[SPEAKER_03]: your bag of fresh frozen that and stuff
isn't nearly as cold as the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff was even though you're putting it
back in the freezer every time sure right
[SPEAKER_03]: so you know we're gonna have the washing
machine in here we're gonna have the
[SPEAKER_03]: tumbler it's gonna be in here so we're
gonna be able to take possibly fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen and run it in a tumbler see what
happens and get like fresh frozen sift if
[SPEAKER_03]: we can keep it cold enough is that
possible so we're gonna have that there
[SPEAKER_03]: over here we'll have this we'll have the
sift tables we'll have the you know mark
[SPEAKER_03]: talks about the problems he has with the
barber bud being it can't be it can't be
[SPEAKER_03]: warm it can't be room temperature you
can't work with it at room temperature
[SPEAKER_03]: possible it has to be cold and they keep
it cold at every single stage to the point
[SPEAKER_03]: where you will have to wear a parka to
come in here and hit the D nails because
[SPEAKER_03]: some stuff will never leave the freezer
you guys have seen me dry sifting in my
[SPEAKER_06]: parka and mine is 10 it's it's the best
place to dry sift and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_06]: coming in here and making some hash with
you in the near future yeah when it's
[SPEAKER_06]: turned into the uh it's gonna be awesome
the locking freezer coming soon hey
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody how's it going how's it the
great gardener bringing you different ways
[SPEAKER_03]: that we make sift today so right now we're
going to show you the tumbler just so
[SPEAKER_03]: happens we got some of the beautiful
freshly seeded CBD Renee it just has just
[SPEAKER_06]: has a fantastic turpenoid profile it's got
a nice aroma I mean it's got a beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: structure as well I really like the
structure of the buds super frothy oh it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just only retains the Renee small little
pop corny buds you know what I would say
[SPEAKER_06]: the profile seems to take on the
fruitiness of the Renee without that sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of funk it's a real high-end fruitiness
it's not kind of brought down by the funk
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that this is almost reminiscent of
one of the Jamaican blueberry or pineapple
[SPEAKER_03]: strings so what we're going to do is this
tumbler is 140 micron 100 mesh stainless
[SPEAKER_06]: steel screen so about 150 140 micron
between 160 and 140 really trying to pick
[SPEAKER_03]: it up off the bottom there's a bunch of
seed in the bottom of that but it'll all
[SPEAKER_03]: fall to the bottom so if you just sort of
grab the bottom from the top here just
[SPEAKER_03]: like the freshest freshest of the fresh
seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: the camera and show you guys in a better
light what these seeds are looking like
[SPEAKER_06]: this is just at the bottom of the yeah
lift it oh here we go perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: high high high percentage of good seeds in
that one that's a nice little amber seed
[SPEAKER_04]: the anomalies yeah the twins the triplets
the things that never get to market very
[SPEAKER_06]: nice the secrets all right a little bit of
bud in there
[SPEAKER_03]: the stopwatch two minutes we'll do a
two-minute run and then we'll do a
[SPEAKER_03]: ten-minute run and then we'll do a
one-hour
[SPEAKER_06]: shake timer shake a couple of minutes of
standing around maybe we'll hit the D nail
[SPEAKER_06]: for those two minutes we'll be back here
in a few seconds 120 to be exact all right
[SPEAKER_06]: we got a couple of minutes we're hovering
over the the great gardeners D now which
[SPEAKER_06]: is indeed a custom unit custom
[SPEAKER_03]: this is so white I don't know if you can
see that really I have to take a look I'll
[SPEAKER_06]: do good video of it so they can see
because it is ridiculous this one's quite
[SPEAKER_06]: a bit more tan in comparison to that yeah
like substantially more like 10 grades two
[SPEAKER_03]: minute timers up put that bowl quick nice
you can hear it in the background ding
[SPEAKER_06]: ding you can also hear the bubble being
made in the background and soon you'll
[SPEAKER_06]: hear my coughing from this Congolese rip
[SPEAKER_06]: all right let's go check out that sip well
what do you know it's 420 happy 420 happy
[SPEAKER_06]: 420 look at that two minutes is up that's
awesome it's true mine says it too what
[SPEAKER_06]: are you doing at 420 well this is what
Matt does oh my goodness does that smell
[SPEAKER_03]: good so as you can see in the nothing near
what Barb does but for two minutes
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah I guess for two minutes it's not too
bad better
[SPEAKER_06]: not use my finger yeah you wouldn't want
to use your fingers yeah that was a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of a shot there towards our critics at
the dispensary the other day we here Joe
[SPEAKER_06]: we get you that's true you don't want your
medicine being manhandled fortunately for
[SPEAKER_06]: us that this isn't your medicine this is
our medicine test that out so we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: test the two minute CBD Renee
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful all right not
[SPEAKER_03]: not too melty it's got a little bit of
bubble in there I can see it probably 15%
[SPEAKER_06]: heads for single screen that's quite
something that's right out of the tumbler
[SPEAKER_06]: machine so no cleaning so you think that
50% of the heads or of that material could
[SPEAKER_06]: be glandular trichome heads it's a it's
very high for what I see for most other
[SPEAKER_06]: people that's the sound of bubble getting
made in the background the washer being
[SPEAKER_06]: rinsed out with the nice cold water 25
micron bag is still lined getting ready to
[SPEAKER_03]: pull we're hitting the flavors the tumbler
is making we're hitting flavors let's just
[SPEAKER_06]: take them there's some creamy bubble that
has been been being made off off-camera
[SPEAKER_06]: what do we got to is this the Renee CBD I
think so yeah Renee CBD all right it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: nice color on that boys nice nice color on
that I mean I'd almost go about saying
[SPEAKER_06]: that whoever made this knew what they were
doing it's all about experimentation I
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely know whoever grew the resin
knew what they were doing all right I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna try this Renee CBD dry sift
two-minute run got a little dab of it here
[SPEAKER_06]: stretched out
[SPEAKER_06]: serious candy flavor going on in that
great
[SPEAKER_06]: odor Wow oh my god that is a really great
odor
[SPEAKER_04]: sticky to a you can tell just by moving oh
yeah like yeah how's that movement to it
[SPEAKER_06]: mm-hmm marshmallowy slow motion jelly
motion
[SPEAKER_04]: just stuck as one big chunk how
[SPEAKER_03]: much it kicked up on the side of the card
it's ridiculous nice resin you
