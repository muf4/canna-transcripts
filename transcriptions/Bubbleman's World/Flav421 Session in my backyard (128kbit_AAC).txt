[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting here with Flav421 in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, you've bought some nice treats
for us to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we're just really having a puff
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hanging out, we're having a session
and we figured, hey, we should film a
[SPEAKER_01]: little for the Bubble Man's world
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I've been waiting to hit this
piece for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't sure who I was going to hit
it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure if it was going to happen
through High Integrity Glass Art or if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to bring it over one day just
in your own personal collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the company had it for a
while and I recently just acquired it
[SPEAKER_00]: personally off High Integrity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell everyone about this cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the first Team Japan cup,
what you would consider Team Japan,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the original incarnation is
Daisuke from Slop, which is the design of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cup, the designers of the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose Rhodes and Kondo, Yoshinori Kondo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dot stacking is by Kondo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dot flips are done by Rose Rhodes and
the construction of the piece itself is
[SPEAKER_00]: done by Daisuke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done at Treating Yourself Toronto,
I think three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two or three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the second incarnation of the
Flame Off at Treating Yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, the competition was the
three Japanese artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as Marcel and... No, no,
it wasn't Marcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was Carlson and Siverson and
Peralta.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Marcel was there running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was the one running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was running it, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Canadian team consisted of Corey
Cottenham, Patrick Stratus, Stratus for
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass, and JT Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jared Toner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... It was a good year for the
glassblowers, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sitting and watching these guys do
this because, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd never been that...
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, and most of the people
there, I'd never seen them ever do any of
their...
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of like, oh, they're
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just watching, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, to have been able to acquire
it myself is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very good of High Integrity Glass
Art to be able to get this for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to light it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've already got the dabbers
loaded, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pre-planning today.
[SPEAKER_01]: P.L.'s.
[SPEAKER_01]: P.L.'s instead of P.R.'s.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not pre-rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't pre-load.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pre... Or we don't pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pre-load.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful sunny day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it is a beautiful sunny day for
dabbing on the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Congo between us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little outdoor action.
[SPEAKER_00]: See your other lovelies sitting over there
soaking up the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these ones just, you know,
they were the last of my indoor crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little bit of bugs and mildew from
friends passing clones on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I finally did was I just sort
of... I got rid of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were the last few.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of just like killing them
completely, I was like, I'll put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking nice now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them sit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what they say about a sick
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it outside and it usually...
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets better pretty fast, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do that with that one right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant them in between the roses and the
poppies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you want to hit that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the slop cups actually hit real
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The function on them is really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a nice feel to them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't hit a ton of them, but the few
that I've hit, I've enjoyed for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to
hitting the nicest thing that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, obviously, the motherships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit so many of your beautiful pipes
as well as higher ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rose from High Integrity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between you two guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the relationship I've had with
glassblowers for the last 15 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Managed to hit some nice pipes in my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was young, like later teenage,
years, I would come to your shop to check
[SPEAKER_00]: out what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, there were other stores
around, but there was nowhere that had
[SPEAKER_00]: quality glass made by the guys in
Bellingham when everybody was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Marcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Slinger was in town, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, way ahead of his time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slinger lived here at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slinger and Hippo were household
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a unique time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually found recently, Melting Point
Footage from the original Degenerate Art
[SPEAKER_01]: Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this footage, in my opinion,
and that art show really spawned the
[SPEAKER_01]: Degenerate Art documentary that Slinger
went on to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, I guess, I talked to him
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little while ago, I asked him,
hey, why didn't you ever use that footage?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I just didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we weren't really talking much at that
time, or he could have probably gotten in
[SPEAKER_01]: touch with me, and I would have made sure
that he got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to put that footage up,
the interviews with all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: glass artists, and some of the footage of
the pipes that were in the show back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2004.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in 2004, we did Degenerate Art,
and then in 2005, we did Regenerate Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were two shows in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were both great shows, and they were
both real fun to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely can't wait to share the
footage of these blowers 10 plus years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: doing interviews at my shop for this art
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like Marcel, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Wiltz was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Amber Pellegrini was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Max, we had there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surfrot was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian and Hippo and Slinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Mackelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: McElroy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, McElroy.
[SPEAKER_01]: McElroy came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Lee showed up.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or he showed up for the second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't remember if he himself showed
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe also Bearclaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his coming out, becoming like he
had never been in a show before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his first show to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many more that I'm forgetting for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to go through the video to see
their faces and to hear them doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great to see them so much
younger too, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to load me up the dabber there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I suppose that could be accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we figure we'd hit a few out of the
ports banger here, out of the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got a few pipes on the
sideline, a couple of ships that we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: filled with different things to hit off
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than ports, we have the silicon
carbide, which of course if you follow
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Verzura's Instagram or Facebook
accounts, you can see that he's really
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying his silicon carbide bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Says it's by far the tastiest hit he's
taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I can test taste that out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've also got the new dab master
sublimator plugged into the atomizer and
[SPEAKER_01]: plugged into the mothership straight fab
that I got from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see if we can't maybe hit some
vapor rips and maybe even some double
[SPEAKER_01]: deckers dabbing on top of the vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see if we can feel that difference
that Enrico's talking about when you hit
[SPEAKER_01]: that dab and pull it through the bed of
weed and have that all sublimate at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I think there's something to be
said for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dab on the, through the top dabber part
with the, with the flowers on the inside
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intriguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a quiver, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the options.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a real nice hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let that sit for the perfect amount of
time to just get the just nice and trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also like I did get a substantial hit
that didn't let me leave me feeling less
[SPEAKER_01]: than, you know, that's the one thing that
I found incredible when I was first got
[SPEAKER_01]: the sublimator and I was getting these big
rips, but it was kind of, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: problems at the time it was, it was
breaking and this was in the early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, I'm definitely not calling out
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a brand new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's increased the quality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't had any breaks on me since I've
reacquired it in the last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the old one, it just sort of,
what happened was eventually it stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: working enough for me and then it was a
pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I do the electric nail,
but the electric nail always felt like I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't quite getting the hit that I was
getting from the sub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now after not using the electric nail for
some time, or sorry, the sublimator,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that the, the, the nail was
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fine, but I stopped a vaporizing
herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I'm really stoked
about getting that this back is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: away from this mentality where one has to
be the best or I have to choose one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to hit courts with a
torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to hit a sublimator with
my herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to carry my D nail with
the three units and these are all things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I want in my quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I get older, I'm learning that it's
not necessarily a, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be happy with a combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about earlier,
you know, ego gets in the way of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree that like to have an open mind
to all the different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody has a personal
preference, you know, but in all reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: until you've actually experienced all the
different varieties, how can you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: your preference is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can know what you think your
preference is, but that's quite different
[SPEAKER_01]: than knowing what your preference is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're going to rip away on this
cup for a little bit, but when we come
[SPEAKER_01]: back, we're going to have the silicone
carbide nail on the table and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the Dabmaster sublimator on the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be back in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the Dabmaster sublimator on
your right on our left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here, plugged into this straight
fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the silicone carbide
hybrid titanium nail from D nail in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Corey Cottenham drop down in the
mothership fab egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess, I don't even know if we're so
much comparing things as much as,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this, this has been the one of the
best hits I've had taste wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I do agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having used it with you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that that, that is a, a very nice,
it's definitely very tasty, but it'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to test it up against the
Dabmaster just to see taste wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the sublimator is doing something
different other than being titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this is a silicone carbide nail and
that's what they focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes down into your pipe,
but the sublimator as, as this might not
[SPEAKER_01]: look like much to people, this atomizer,
this, this metal bowl, titanium bowl,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it truly to my, in my opinion,
it's something, about it makes it the game
[SPEAKER_01]: changer because of the way it just holds
that heat in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the closest thing I've seen to it
actually was D nail puking vehicles,
[SPEAKER_01]: deep dish banger or sorry, the dog,
the dog house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the one that you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said before, I actually quite
liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dog house was fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much miss that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually don't understand why they
didn't continue with that sort of thought
[SPEAKER_00]: process in that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you talk to them, you should
tell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you say a little vapor head?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out the harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not tried your home yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small little pinch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the atomizer, the right temperature,
you smell the vapor instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just when it's touching the side of the
walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just left this even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very nice taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got another good one in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy schnapples, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got me jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one just sort of just jumped up at
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the crazy thing too is that you just
hit herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you just took a five star
dab of the super melt or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just, if we rosin that,
it probably would have been just a medium
[SPEAKER_01]: to small size dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of like a third of a small joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it felt like when you just
exhaled those two big rips either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm definitely a fan on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you produced like some really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't call it reclaimed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it sublimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sublimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it truly, what it is is it's a
distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what Horatio did with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took his DH, he took his d-limonene and
he rotovap it till it evaporated and then
[SPEAKER_01]: recondensed and everything that was left
in the rotovap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that nasty get rid of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that is the recondensation of the
vapor from the.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the smell of that is so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't smell like anything's been
burnt or anything bad has occurred in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the taste actually doesn't have like,
I've never been a fan of vaporizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not like flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not something I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it doesn't give you a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the taste it has the weird funky like
burnt popcorn sort of a taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because I say what we just did there
so much isn't vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaping cannabis as much as what we really
did was we just vaporized hash that
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to be diluted on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we strip the canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we extracted it with heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this flash way, almost the same way
rosin works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you get this pressure and this
heat and the oil comes out at the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, somehow he's figured it out that
when you get that herb in there and I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, we'll do it after we hit the silicon
carbide, we'll do a double decker hit and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we'll, well, that's what we'll finish
it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get the d-limonene and the bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: With weed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put the herb in the bowl,
put the hash on top of the herb in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl and then double decker the
d-limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let that heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really important thing for the
sublimator to work properly is to always
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the atomizer hot, hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be the temperature that the
wand is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real job of the wand is to heat the
atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have to keep that in for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always keep it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing with the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said always leave it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let this cool down and it cools
down just a few degrees, when you put it
[SPEAKER_01]: over and you suck that cooler temperature
through, it's going to steal some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: magic that only occurs at a certain
temperature for a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm ready for a little harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of excited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really tasty actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I love vaping flavors, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while since I've vaped any
herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are shocked because they
said, oh, bubble man's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't smoke weed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble man's smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I'm not smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually vaporizing the hash off of
the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't deny, like there's just
a certain reality to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you can't deny the flavor
that comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I personally don't know if I would
be putting that into any of my pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the ability to use it with you,
you can't deny the things that are claimed
[SPEAKER_00]: are 100% true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this mothership board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big beaker pipe, hold it careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never feel like it's going to tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, it's got one of the really nice wide
bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not put it in the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the widest base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got the widest base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a wider base.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's the widest base mothership
I've ever personally held.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of all the ones that have come
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, he's got a bunch of different
pipes that you can put this thing in that
[SPEAKER_01]: he's carrying now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I don't like about it is the
plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm just giving an opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with the quality of
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I don't like using anything that
has plastic on it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole metal thing just sort of
feels like I understand that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: necessity to the helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get the grass for LeSkidi
in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police and thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the metal just feels a little
strange to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say glass and all,
but that's how you feel sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, truly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet, otherwise, you have to admit,
if it didn't have the rip that it had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't even consider hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I would not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't actually function the way it
says that it actually would function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pass it off as nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they definitely have something there
with the way they... Look, we just hit
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would call a medium to small size
joint between the two of us.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally cut through the hash that we
smoked already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in the sense that I'm higher,
just different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took it to this direction a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the way it vaporizes,
it makes it a little more cerebral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as opposed to... I would agree
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost sativizes, if that's a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or thin-leaf drug variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The narrow-leaf drug cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NLD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NLD.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, truly, it does have some sort of
difference to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about silicon carbide?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to try it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon carbide?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we should even go back to
the ports, just to finish it off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wouldn't say no.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon carbide is at temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got her at about 700 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a dab right there already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a dab right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a nice big carb cap here,
which will come in handy for this
[SPEAKER_01]: monstrous surface that this is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great tasting rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in my throat at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like deep in my chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silicon carbide definitely has this,
I've mentioned it before, preserved taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something preserved that doesn't
get preserved on most other surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tested it against titanium,
sapphire, ceramic, quartz, and titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I went back to the same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you stoned there, Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: And titanium, and quartz, and titanium,
and quartz, and titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your carb cap as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a little bit of an itchy nose,
too, on the exhale, which is always a good
[SPEAKER_01]: sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely need a big carb cap for a
silicon carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you fucking do, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually the sublimator carb cap
that he uses for his torch nail that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I pulled it out to use with this
because I love the nice neck on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good little dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a good little cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good little carb cap, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel pretty iry after cup rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is substantially better than
any tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only really compare it to quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's tastier than quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I haven't used the sapphire bit
that you have a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a pain to carry it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sapphire, because it's porous,
it seems to absorb the material into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be a nice off-white-ish color,
or clear-ish, opaque.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll absorb the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally now, unless you want to
torch it, which you're not supposed to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to leave it on the nail for quite
some time to clean off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a bit of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit too often to want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I end up pulling out one of these
units.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually have two or three D-nails going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with the sublimator back in the
quiver, well, it's really opened up the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to vaporize herb, but get a hit
that's more on par.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would say the hits that we're
getting out of this that are vapor hits,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on par with the hits that we're
taking that are hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I was surprised at how choked I
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not choked like it hurt my throat,
it was too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, just a huge toke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all the residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got a huge fucking toke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's efficient, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could tell how huge of a toke you
got, because when I pulled it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was oil condensed all on the outside
of the down stamp, which wasn't there
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to you taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from how it's recondensing
super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice sunny day, waiting for friends to
come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got some buddies coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably be doing more filming.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be a show on its own,
or this could be the intro to a big,
[SPEAKER_01]: long three-day show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no idea what's going to happen
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe many parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll be fun to see it turn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like someone's here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, shall we go back to quartz or try
one of the... I think it's time for a
[SPEAKER_01]: double decker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to clear up my glass off the
table, because it's time for double
[SPEAKER_01]: deckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get this in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got it on temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you a little dab of the LHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean a little one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we need to go overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this for me to start, or you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to put hash in, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put this in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the LHO on the top?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and then we'll put a little dab of
the LHO right onto the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a big one of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more than enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just find when you put too much on,
it just seems to be more of a medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than a recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little
[SPEAKER_01]: double decker rip for Flav 421.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's a sketchy thing when you pull
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want to put too hard...
You pulled it out sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pulled it out by this handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're going to do it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't even do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do this, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just give it a quick little kind of...
Oh yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of actually pulling out the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you still get a good rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still get that sort of, I got a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I see it clear and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would never pull it out just
by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially right now, if you notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can be much tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, there's no wiggle to it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is tight, so... Yeah, I don't
generally pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the end of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to actually pull this out,
clean it, and take another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some hash, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, oh absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then what I'll do is I'll actually put
the bowl back in, and put that back in,
[SPEAKER_01]: just for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to ensure that that's at the
temperature that I want it to be at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because literally, you can forget this up
here, and that can cool down so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it just, it turns your 10 into a 7.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a convection oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get to that perfect temperature
and what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of the science of the cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening at a certain temperature,
water goes from not boiling to boiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are these sort of intriguing
innovations able to happen in those little
[SPEAKER_01]: zones where the magic hides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I truly believe, somehow, some way,
that Enrico figured out some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's the hash in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good flavor on that grass, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well it was, like I said,
grown with just water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barely any food given, so it had like a
seven week flush or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it's crystal-y, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the microscope under it,
and I was like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've tasted worse weed by people
that have put a hell of a lot more effort
[SPEAKER_00]: into it, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: People put too much effort sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying so hard to spend, to make money
that they've already spent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not doing any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I just want to grow a little
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real nice to have four, five,
or six different bags of your own herb,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was a real light-baked bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a bell-ringer, dude.
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bell-ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a triple-decker sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the Aida South beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even do the L.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you didn't do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was the- Was the hash and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even get the triple-decker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did a double-decker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely forgetting about- Clubhouse is
tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely forgetting about potentially
the strongest part of the R.I.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got to say, that was a R.I.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: -er.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to continue to abuse
ourselves with various forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: phytocannabinoid inhalation devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get back to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be the end, but this could be
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
We'll see you next time.
