[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome back to the
Cannabis Journal Club where we review and
[SPEAKER_01]: interpret United States cannabis patents
and scientific journals with concise
[SPEAKER_01]: overview of complex scientific literature
in an understandable and easy to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: manner to expose the knowledge hidden in
the scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not claim any medical utility and of
these government patents or scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: articles, we advise you to obtain your own
copy of these public documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will also make them available when we
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the description, in the
description of this video, I'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce Dr. David Allen and we're going
to get into today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Allen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're good to go, Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Dr. David Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a retired cardiovascular and thoracic
surgeon and I'm self-taught in the science
[SPEAKER_00]: of the endocannabinoid signaling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're going to review my
original article entitled Ignorance is Not
[SPEAKER_00]: Bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a copy of this article by
looking up Cannabis Digest and Ignorance
[SPEAKER_00]: is Not Bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was I was trained in
cardiovascular surgery but my career quit
[SPEAKER_00]: me in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I obtained a medical license in
California and I moved to Sacramento and
[SPEAKER_00]: started a cannabis program practice in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought to myself, well,
I've not been taught about this science
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had to train myself in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't be alone in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I need to figure out what
colleges, universities are teaching this
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so myself and my three employees
called 157 medical schools in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the study was only for the United
States and it should be repeated in other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries and should also include
veterinary medicine schools as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the summer of 2013, we called
157 medical schools and asked the
[SPEAKER_00]: directors of the curriculum three
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a department of
endocannabinoid science with a director?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you teaching the ECS as an organized
course?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it even mentioned in any ancillary
courses like pharmacology,
[SPEAKER_00]: pathophysiology, neuroanatomy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer was only 13% of American
universities teaching physicians even
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a science that is completely
ignored by the medical facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like your doctor not
knowing the circulatory system or the
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system or any of its other major
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ECS is a master control system
that regulates all physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And should be included in all medical
schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will find out that many times the
patients know more about this science than
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctors do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my study was made entirely to
expose the hypocrisy of not teaching this
[SPEAKER_00]: science to physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so please obtain a copy of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's printed in Cannabis Digest under
ignorance is not bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we called these
colleges and asked for the director of the
[SPEAKER_00]: curriculum and what they were teaching
medical students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out a lot of resistance to
our survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call up and say, hi, this is Dr.
David Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I speak to the director of the
curriculum?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would say, well, what's this
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would tell them and they would be
astounded because many of them had no
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of what I was speaking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were suspicious and were
reluctant to give us any answers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we changed our tactics and when my
employees would call up, we would pretend
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were medical students or
pre-medical students looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: universities to apply to that would have a
special knowledge in this new science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started getting a lot of answers
from the medical schools and the employees
[SPEAKER_00]: of the director of the curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that a lot of their
statements showed extreme ignorance of
[SPEAKER_00]: this study and like, why would we teach
this kind of science?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a medical school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you asking these kinds of
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so please read the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of statements that we
collected from the medical schools
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I give a quick cliff notes on just
what you've said so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're getting into, you're almost
at results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this article really, the sort of
cliff notes of it is number one,
[SPEAKER_01]: the significance of the endocannabinoid
signaling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's considered a crucial medical
discovery likened to the advent of sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: surgical techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts as a master control system,
which of course, Dr. Allen just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: preventing disease and combating aging by
managing physiology, cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: communication, and scavenging oxygen-free
radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get into the medical potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ECS has vast therapeutic potential,
particularly through cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which could really shift medicine from
symptom management to disease prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's implicated in reducing diabetes,
stroke damage, heart attack scars,
[SPEAKER_01]: and combating cancer via tumor growth
inhibition, reducing metastasis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and induction of apoptosis, which all of
these things are key words that you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: punch in and learn about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, we've got his survey methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to contact the curriculum
directors at 157 U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: medical schools, asking about the ECS
department, organized courses or mentions
[SPEAKER_01]: in related classes, and immediately
receives initial resistance, which led
[SPEAKER_01]: them to posing as prospective students to
gather responses more effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they even had to do this,
and then next, resistance and ignorance
[SPEAKER_01]: responses ranged from, how do you spell
endocannabinoid, to dismiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't teach anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many schools showed unawareness or
reluctance, with some questioning the
[SPEAKER_01]: survey's intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're getting into the results,
and I'll let Dr. Allen continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our survey study proved that only 13% of
American medical schools even mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: this science, and nobody has organized
courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no directors or departments of
this science.
[SPEAKER_00]: One mistake that I made is, after we
completed this study, we mailed copies of
[SPEAKER_00]: the studies to the directors of the
curriculum, which didn't have the effect I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted it to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have mailed the copies of this
article to the dean of the medical school,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would have more impetus in changing
the curriculum to include this in their
[SPEAKER_00]: future studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exposing the ignorance of the
medical school, which was caused,
[SPEAKER_00]: no doubt, from the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug war is trying to suppress this
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: My entire life has been to try to expose
the medical efficacy of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's fairly hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no place that you can actually
publish studies anymore regarding this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study needs to be repeated in Canada,
in South America, and in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and should include veterinary medical
schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: My suspicion is the veterinary medical
schools will have more knowledge and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will be teaching this science more so than
the human medical schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to the political repression,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which the article argues, these political
barriers, not scientific merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting into this dangerous thing
where it's like something other than
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific merit is being responsible for
the restriction of the ECS in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the government's classification
of cannabis as a schedule one drug creates
[SPEAKER_01]: a catch-22, which limits studying that
could prove its safety and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some positive exceptions from
the article?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a couple of schools mentioned that
they were doing some studies and research
[SPEAKER_00]: and would include this in their future
lectures and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hopeful that this study that I've
done, and I just did this with three
[SPEAKER_00]: employees, so this study could be
repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show that this is a science that's
worthy of doctors and veterinary medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors to learn about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my impetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: My motivation is to have doctors learn
about this so they know more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that are coming to them with
questions about this science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a call to action, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The study urges medical schools to
integrate ECS education, comparing its
[SPEAKER_01]: neglect to historical resistance against
sterile techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: It suggests public pressure on deans to
adopt this science.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to reach out to Dr. Alan and
myself, please do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reach out to me at
bcbubblemanaticloud.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Dr. Alan is calidoc215 at
gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali215.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even a metabolic imperative because
they've proven if you block this ECS that
[SPEAKER_00]: sperm cannot enter the ovum, so you need a
functioning ECS for conception to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without a proper functioning ECS,
conception won't occur and may be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for many women not being able
to full-term birth a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has great implications and you
should put this cannabis and hemp in your
[SPEAKER_00]: diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually hemp may be more important,
a medical substance, to be put in your
[SPEAKER_00]: diet than even marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, breast milk contains both
endocannabinoids and essential amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hemp is pretty much cannabis is the
only plant that produces all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: essential amino acids, including the three
that children require for organ and bone
[SPEAKER_01]: development, as well as phyto
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost this breast-like milk
substance that cannabis produces in two of
[SPEAKER_01]: its forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad you hit on the broader
implications because cannabis is framed as
[SPEAKER_01]: a nutraceutical with antioxidant benefits,
not just a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could potentially revolutionize
medicine towards prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Allen questions why ECS study is
suppressed, linking it to funding and
[SPEAKER_01]: political interest, which I don't think is
a very big jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably very accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we want to finish off with some of
the historical parallels that your article
[SPEAKER_01]: references.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a doctor in Vienna who was
an OB-GYN doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had two hospitals that delivered
children in Vienna, a doctor's hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: and a midwife's hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doctor's hospital had a massive
death rate for birthing children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the midwife's hospital had much better
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Dr. Semmelweis was doing an
operation, an autopsy, on a woman that had
[SPEAKER_00]: died during her childbirth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was his assistants got a
they were opening the abdomen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: abdomen was full of pus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called puerperal fever and was the
cause of death for many women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when his assistant cut his hand two
days later, he died of sepsis of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that the woman had died from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Semmelweis knew that there was
something in the pus that caused this
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction and killed his assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he started scrubbing his hands with
carboxylic acid, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was caustic and it caused people's
hands to be red and inflamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he proved that by hand washing that
they lowered the infection rate in
[SPEAKER_00]: surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was before microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew about germs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was before germ theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was washing his hands and he was
trying to get the other doctors to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all objected to it because it
wasn't known science at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually ran him out of town
because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just suggesting that you should
wash your hands before surgery was a new
[SPEAKER_00]: and radical idea and was rejected by the
medical establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today, the medical establishment is
ignoring the science of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid signaling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to get people to
understand that this is this is a super
[SPEAKER_00]: important science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want everybody to learn about this
because it can affect you and the family,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please look at our other studies we've
published on cannabis and heart attacks,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that it decreases the size of a
heart attack by 66 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another article we reviewed proves that it
decreases the size of a stroke by 50
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is amazing information that
could save the lives in people in your own
[SPEAKER_00]: families if you learn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to know what the world did to
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just the medical establishment
denying and ridiculing and mocking him for
[SPEAKER_01]: washing his hands, if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 1865, the increasingly outspoken
Semmelweis allegedly suffered a nervous
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown and was committed to an asylum
by his colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what happened in that asylum is he
was beaten by the guards very badly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died 14 days later from a gangrenish
wound on his right hand that was probably
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by the beating.
[SPEAKER_01]: How insane is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy who brought hand washing to just
save lives ends up getting probably
[SPEAKER_01]: falsely accused of a mental breakdown by
his colleagues because they love to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that back in the day when people stepped
out of line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about destroying your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to put you in a mental
hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the mental hospital,
they damn near beat him to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he ends up gangrenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his hand, the very thing that he
learned to wash to reduce this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: fever, is what killed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so sick and it almost parallels the
way Dr. Allen was treated when he came
[SPEAKER_01]: out, just asking if they even taught about
this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we're dealing with a very
unique group of people who are not willing
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear what is being said sometimes,
so much so that they'll take it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: most extreme level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happened, unfortunately,
to Ignaz Semmelweis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That almost happened to me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen, the call to action is,
if you think you can help, we are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be organizing this program again in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to acquire a bunch of interns,
hopefully people that are in veterinarian
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the medical world in some way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to kind of build a team up
and we're going to start calling these
[SPEAKER_01]: hospitals again and these medical schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'll do is we'll make sure I get
that we create a really proper template to
[SPEAKER_01]: approach them so that they don't get the
claws and the fangs out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of got to come at them from the
side angle like Dr. Allen did.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come at them too direct,
you could end up in a mental hospital
[SPEAKER_01]: being beaten to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, my friends, is Cannabis Journal
Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else to add, Dr. Allen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for this platform that
we can spread this news.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want interns to help us because if you
help us do another study in Canada or
[SPEAKER_00]: South America, your name will go on a
paper that will make history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have your name in history by
exposing that this science is not being
[SPEAKER_00]: taught to physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll find out if veterinary medicine
doctors learn more about this than their
[SPEAKER_00]: human doctor counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doing this project with you and I'm
looking forward to staying more consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: and releasing at least one of these videos
a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess for that, we'll see you all
next week on the Cannabis Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can give a little thumbs up on
the video and a subscription, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would appreciate that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
