[SPEAKER_03]: What's up welcome to bubble man's world
I'm here today with Phil and he's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: tell us a little bit about his breeding
company and his strains that he's breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: for his own personal medical issues and
We're gonna take some D nail rips and then
[SPEAKER_03]: this little guy here, too He's the foreman
on the job Awesome yeah, I bet he loves
[SPEAKER_03]: the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sure does get those vitamin lights in
there for him Yeah, d4 20k and those guys
[SPEAKER_03]: up in Prince George swear by the Vitamin
lights visit vitamin lights really lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah for your trifle production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're really like all over that
stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple plants and flower with them
the results are absolutely amazing I've
[SPEAKER_02]: grown single plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown multiple plants under CFLs
Still good tricone production absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: not just great yields the track on
production What do we got right here this
[SPEAKER_02]: little plant here that you brought down
this is something we Worked on for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple years here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an og 18 grown from seed and then
crossed with the West Coast sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: mail We got the West Coast sour diesel
beans from Ned man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a gift about a year and a half
ago We it was this f1 of the West Coast
[SPEAKER_02]: sour diesel we went through them did a
little bit of back-crossing found our good
[SPEAKER_02]: mail nice glandular producing mail Oh
beautiful and smashed that onto our
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry made the sour berry
[SPEAKER_03]: And og 18 would be give a little history
on that that would be the Jew gold that's
[SPEAKER_02]: well the og 18 That's what they used to
make the Jew gold in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use that to make the kosher what
everyone calls the kosher kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA genetics came out with the og 18 that
was their first release of their og kush
[SPEAKER_02]: they refeminized her because It came out
they came out with a phenotype that was
[SPEAKER_02]: more Lemony more chemi more sour and a
little bit better yielding So they just
[SPEAKER_02]: reversed her again, and then that's where
we get the og 18 from okay great I know
[SPEAKER_02]: that history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a personal favorite for for
medicinal use and for all around just
[SPEAKER_03]: being a great a great smelling plant I
love the name sweat band Here's a little
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet skunk dry sip for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, buddy you can
[SPEAKER_03]: Name your seed company and maybe just sort
of talk about the history of really what
[SPEAKER_03]: brought you to start your breathing Nice
oh, man, I'm telling you everyone that's
[SPEAKER_03]: hit this sweet skunk has done exactly that
yesterday Remo went Wow This is a special
[SPEAKER_03]: when he said it is well he said you know
this is The one where you light it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: room and people come from across the room
and they want to ask So yeah, we are right
[SPEAKER_02]: now We're working under the name for
genetics Just you started that name
[SPEAKER_02]: because of a lot of dishonesty in the
company with the companies in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of lies a lot of gimmicks a lot of
Bullshit sure the classic CD industry you
[SPEAKER_02]: bought exactly the seed industry was
pretty seedy You order a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: from anywhere Calling it God, but you
germinate it and you get weird-looking
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that don't even look like cannabis
You get stuff that doesn't germinate you
[SPEAKER_02]: get seeds that aren't even mottled not
even healthy seeds There's just a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: uncontrolled stuff going on in the seed
industry a lot of gimmicks stuff That just
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't helping customers that patients a
lot of bullshit It's a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_03]: energy as well when you're growing from
seed and you're looking for that Fino
[SPEAKER_03]: especially if you're breeding the amount
of time and energy it becomes incredibly
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost exponential To give someone seeds
for example is like oh here have some
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds For that person to take those seeds
and grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the real gift unless you really
know these seeds are stable, and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna grow what?
[SPEAKER_03]: God is a perfect example because God bud
is God bud and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing like God bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so it's so specific that those
terpenes To crack those seeds and not get
[SPEAKER_03]: those that smell that would hurt that
would hurt a lot OG Kush dry sift from
[SPEAKER_02]: D420k A lot of people ask What are you
dabbing on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you dab dry sift and bubble?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's your answer everybody You
can ask that on the daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you really dab dry sift and bubble?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's quite quite often I get it as
well and it's like full melt Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: when the quality is there absolutely I
wanted to ask you a little bit about Sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of the cannabinoid profiles that you look
for I know that you you suffer from
[SPEAKER_02]: Cluster my cluster migraines out
trigeminal autonomic Basically it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: right-sided semi-orbital migraine that's
telling the right side of
[SPEAKER_02]: This happens anywhere from three minutes
to three hours three times a day to 40
[SPEAKER_02]: times a day The medication that the
doctors had me on they had beta blockers
[SPEAKER_02]: lithium lithium scary and a 23 year old
not being able to go under his girlfriend
[SPEAKER_02]: because He's on beta blockers and just
completely like no energy zombie down
[SPEAKER_02]: zombie down on the medication getting
gastric ulcers ulcers Continuously because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the heavy medication the injections
that they had me on were completely taking
[SPEAKER_02]: me out My hair was starting to fall out as
you know, I have long hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna lose it It was my hair was
coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was those were your alternatives
to Canvas to this absolutely harmless
[SPEAKER_02]: lovely plant right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's able to do so much It's the
opposite of harmless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not full.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah It is benign.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a benign helpful herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep We love it as I'm sure most of you
watching do as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a og cush dry sift rip for you Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: so might head up on the mountain today not
sure I guess it's Super Bowl Sunday today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're having some Super Bowls.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are Super Bowls This is our sort of
Super Bowl Might take you guys up the
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain a little later on and we're
waiting in 20 minutes or so from now one
[SPEAKER_03]: of Phil's tents are gonna go on so we
might take you in there and just Show you
[SPEAKER_03]: a few strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk about a few of your a few of
the cannabinoid profiles that you seek
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do we can also go in and do a green
light and a couple of other ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: too See if we can show you guys some
sleeping ladies So the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles that I look for well because of
my condition it doesn't just cause the
[SPEAKER_02]: pain It's not the neurological pain The
main thing is the neuropathic and the
[SPEAKER_02]: neurological problems and you need to find
strains that directly go for that directly
[SPEAKER_02]: target that Extremely extremely
psychoactive hybrids do that, but you also
[SPEAKER_02]: have to look at what's happening after the
headaches I'm getting nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was developing post-traumatic stress
disorder I had really early PTSD Starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just from the horrible experience
of going through the headaches and then
[SPEAKER_02]: being afraid Just sitting there after
shaking just wandering is another one
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna happen like eventually you just go
crazy You get an attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they call them cluster migraines for
a reason because they come in clusters You
[SPEAKER_02]: get one it goes goes away You're sitting
there your sweat kind of goes away You
[SPEAKER_02]: wipe the sweat and the tears and then the
moment you stand up and breathe it wallops
[SPEAKER_02]: you again And you fall down to the floor
and that's when you're kind of shattered
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't really know what to do It
just keeps hitting you over and over and
[SPEAKER_02]: over again and gets you to a point where
you're just so worn down and unhealthy
[SPEAKER_02]: that you just you'll basically take
anything and cannabis has always worked
[SPEAKER_02]: but the doctors for some reason were Just
not did not want to let me use cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: solely They felt that I needed to take all
these heavy this heavy medication and I
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to take pills and injections and I
needed to go take blood tests and all
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts Of body tests all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sleeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 123 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm now 160 pounds So you must be more
afraid than most at the thought of losing
[SPEAKER_03]: your ability to grow your own medicine and
to Maintain your own genetic and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid profile, you know lineage
Maintaining my genetics and maintaining my
[SPEAKER_02]: health directly depend on my ability to
grow if I'm not able to grow Legally then
[SPEAKER_03]: there's only one other way, you know
Really have the luxury of applying to all
[SPEAKER_03]: the different companies Buying herb from
all of them and finding out which one
[SPEAKER_03]: works because you've already done that
well exactly like I was I was a part of an
[SPEAKER_02]: article that was just put out in a local
newspaper and It basically says that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have the money to go through the
trial-and-error process again with all
[SPEAKER_02]: these big licensed producers I can't go
through the 40 strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have at eight to twelve dollars
a gram Okay, well I need two grams of each
[SPEAKER_02]: to figure out if they work or not,
but I don't Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't burn plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I was just gonna ask you you're
not a plant matter guy You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't we don't combust that is
everybody knows and as Mark said quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: few times All the medicine on this plant
it's only a very small percentage
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows and that's why you're so
so so little and wet washing fresh clothes
[SPEAKER_02]: and dry simply Because you're extracting
something so so so small something so so
[SPEAKER_02]: so big so You need the availability to
have the trim to have the clothes trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's just the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's why you might want to juice
your leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you You know, you might want to
leave tea from your stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to eat the buds You might want to
extract the resin from the buds and eat
[SPEAKER_03]: that or smoke it or vaporize it or
whatever These are the options you have
[SPEAKER_03]: when you grow your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are not the options you have when a
licensed producer Production facility is
[SPEAKER_03]: offering to sell you Cannabis bud only
probably I'm guessing not even in bud form
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll probably grind the plants down
into a powder and sell it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the gamma-irradiated product that is
required by some standards to They say to
[SPEAKER_02]: get rid of mold and bacteria They're such
experts Clearly there's so many of us
[SPEAKER_02]: patients are willing to buy their products
I see a place for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really see a place Licensed producers,
you know, there's elderly people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people with kids that have
syndrome and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want disability people Yeah,
some people don't want to go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary or don't want to grow their
deal with the guy down the street That's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of maybe screwed them over before at
the same time Everyone needs to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: right to choose Their own medicine we in
the directly in the Canadian Charter it
[SPEAKER_02]: says we have access to cannabis in all of
its forms Every single form you have
[SPEAKER_02]: direct access to so if that's the whole
plant and it's leaves for juicing and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes for hash Buds for tinctures and
seed oil exactly for being a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use my use my non viable seeds I eat
them just like how's the great gardener
[SPEAKER_02]: just pop them right in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my new mantra you need your
endocannabinoid system Daily, what what is
[SPEAKER_03]: this again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that is Wow, that's also OG kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna say it's cushy from Prince
George Deeper yeah, that's d4 20k.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one I cleaned that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He cleaned really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely Great so grab yourself
one there and oh wow dangerous might want
[SPEAKER_03]: to go pointy I think I left it a little
dirty on the other end, but oh and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just stuck together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't been pressed Yeah, I know it's
like it's like hard powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to kind of shave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so it's so lovely looking so
These producers definitely for about 90%
[SPEAKER_02]: like I commented on your Facebook the
other day about 90% of these produce or
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of the people will benefit from these
producers There's a large portion of the
[SPEAKER_02]: population that will do really really
really well of the of the city population
[SPEAKER_02]: people that have more money that are
living in Suburban areas though.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're able to afford that and they have
the luxury exactly that'll work well for
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but the people that Are a little bit
more rural the people that are living in
[SPEAKER_02]: more stretched out communities Outside of
the Greater Vancouver area Toronto,
[SPEAKER_02]: Manitoba stuff like that We need the
ability to grow because we're so far away
[SPEAKER_02]: from dispensaries and we're so far away
from the city and the hustle and bustle
[SPEAKER_02]: and where these Productions are normally
happening and designated to happen in
[SPEAKER_02]: these agricultural areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live nowhere near where these are going
to be happening so everything has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: done by mail and We're sitting here in the
woods Suffering from a condition waiting
[SPEAKER_02]: for a package by the mail that might not
make it on time that might know I mean you
[SPEAKER_03]: could break it down even as simple as the
disconnect of getting a medicine that's
[SPEAKER_03]: just you know, potentially grounding
irradiated and like grown by someone you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know and you never as opposed to
your Plants that you've collected that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've acquired through your own personal
bioassay that you've grown that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: loved I mean anyone that's ever grown
cannabis can attest that Not only is it
[SPEAKER_03]: great for the fact that it gets you
cannabis resin at the end of the Cycle,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it gets you excited to grow and most
people that grow cannabis will also be
[SPEAKER_03]: inspired to grow some tomatoes and grow
some cucumbers and grow some potatoes You
[SPEAKER_03]: do you just start growing so it's another
one of those things We should always have
[SPEAKER_03]: the right to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna go out with that said we're
gonna pop a few more bowls So we're here
[SPEAKER_03]: with Phil we're checking out one of his
sweat band tents So what is this a four by
[SPEAKER_03]: four by four six inch
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the sweat bands Well,
this is the og 18 West Coast sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: it's basically just the best of both of
those worlds I wanted to take a really
[SPEAKER_02]: really strong sour sour diesel and Just
kind of play off both of those on each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and create something that was
Perfect for my condition that started
[SPEAKER_02]: starts on the top of your head It goes
down to the tip of your body and just goes
[SPEAKER_02]: to every single tip of your fingers and
your toes Hence the name sweat band it
[SPEAKER_02]: starts up here goes all the way down for
your whole entire body So how much how
[SPEAKER_02]: many more weeks do these have I have about
four and a half five I take the sweat band
[SPEAKER_02]: So like 11 or 12 Especially I usually
pollinate a couple of branches for
[SPEAKER_02]: back-crossing Like this one right here was
pollinated about four or five days ago
[SPEAKER_02]: Some semi swollen okay, let's is in there
some little seeds So once I pollinate it's
[SPEAKER_02]: about five or six weeks until the seeds
are mature And I usually pollinate around
[SPEAKER_02]: week three or four when there's nice nice
flower clusters already forming so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so about 11 or 12 weeks usually And that
especially with the kush heavy strains In
[SPEAKER_02]: the good dominant strains, you let it go
that extra week nice amber heads you add
[SPEAKER_02]: to the sour tones You bring out more
flavors more sedative effect a stronger
[SPEAKER_02]: Some would say a stronger herb when you
let it go a little bit longer,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially for neurological diseases
Stress pain sleeping anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want something a little bit more
sedative
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, thanks for Sharing the
information with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can people check you out online true
genetics right now on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have an Instagram page We'll have
a kickoff right away and a website in the
[SPEAKER_02]: springtime We'll have five or six strains
stabilized and ready to go by June Testers
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to get ahold of it You can
follow us through Instagram more than
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to take new testers to get things
ready for everyone to have Strains like
[SPEAKER_02]: this for everyone soon Awesome,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome See you soon again on bubble man's
world peace
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Oh Wow, that is the silver rock
star for med man seeds This one we
[SPEAKER_02]: selected because it just stinks like blue
cheese dressing specifically rotten as
[SPEAKER_02]: Rotten as it could ever be but lovely at
the same time and if it definitely It can
[SPEAKER_02]: be pulled down in nine weeks if you want
That's why it looks a little bit further
[SPEAKER_02]: along than the rest of the room because it
can be pulled down but again for that
[SPEAKER_02]: extra aroma and sedative effect and just
Stinky stinky stinky smell you let it go
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as the plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome man.
Yeah, buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: You You
[SPEAKER_00]: You You You You You You You You
