[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sitting here on the beautiful sea to
sky highway Overlooking the house sound
[SPEAKER_00]: which is part of the Georgia straight
which is actually the Pacific Ocean Just
[SPEAKER_00]: heading back down from Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent the last couple of days up there
really beautiful powder fell overnight And
[SPEAKER_00]: actually today I got one of my best runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten in a long time but had some
work to do needed to head back to my home
[SPEAKER_00]: and So I figured I'd stop here at the
Shannon Archer Memorial bench This was a
[SPEAKER_00]: bench for a young lady who passed away on
the highway back in 2005 She was only born
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1985 so she was only 20 years old and
So this is a bench that her family have
[SPEAKER_00]: set up in remembrance for her if you're
ever traveling down the sea to sky highway
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it to be a great place to stop and
have a little session and just Enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to do brought
myself my little hitman rig Pull that guy
[SPEAKER_00]: out The nail one thing we will need is a
little bit of water so I'll be right back
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Back with the agua as we were
saying in Spain Solo agua no butano Really
[SPEAKER_00]: been loving this little baby cakes from
the hitman crew Nice little Amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble on it perfect amount of water nice
small rig that fits pretty much anywhere I
[SPEAKER_00]: go And now it's just a matter of Pulling
out a dab of something delicious I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a ton of stuff from the great gardener in
here as well as some of my own watermelon
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're gonna go D420k OG Kush
full melt dry sift I Think that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: where we go today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love the texture on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's bone dry powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste much to press a little
piece into a into a hit I Actually left my
[SPEAKER_00]: skillet tools in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe with the ripper seeds guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I haven't heard back yet,
but I'll tell you those tools sure come in
[SPEAKER_00]: handy You don't realize how often you need
them until they're gone All right picked
[SPEAKER_00]: up my little crème brûlée torch at the
Whistler kitchen store thought that was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of funny All
[SPEAKER_00]: right dabs Dabs on the ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: Still pretty new at the torching thing I
have to say I really like the electronic
[SPEAKER_00]: nails Obviously the electronic nails
aren't really gonna let you dab in a place
[SPEAKER_00]: like this so The little mini rig in the
torch comes in quite handy
