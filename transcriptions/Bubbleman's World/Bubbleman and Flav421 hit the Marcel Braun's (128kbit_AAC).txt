[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, hey, welcome to Bubbleman's
World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with Flav421.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, we're kind of celebrating
Marcel Braun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, other glassblowers were involved with
these incredible pieces and Flav's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: go through them and explain you know,
some of the technicalities, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: glassblowers that were involved and
whatnot, but generally, it's really a
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcel vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very much a Marcel vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of ready lines going on,
a lot of air traps going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why don't we start by taking a dab
of some beautiful Full Mount Bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the Marcel Carlson Colum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is one of the crate sets that
him and Chris did.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hit this one in Toronto at
Treating Yourself and it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the chip sections that Chris did are
lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shaping is really good and honestly,
the hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was really happy with this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about this crate though that
maybe I should even go get is the Sherlock
[SPEAKER_01]: that it came with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful and very, very rare to see a
Carlson Marcel Sherlock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's the only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't claim to know, but I do believe
it's the only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll definitely have to show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got the D-nail with the quartz bowl
on the 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: D-nail with the quartz bowl set to 840.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice Full Mount hash.
Exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, always a pleasure to come over
and sesh with Flav.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, this is right before I kind of
said to him, hey, how should we set this
[SPEAKER_02]: up?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we gonna say?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just says, we're just having a
session, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good quote from the humble man that is
Flav 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am always on the course to smoke out of
any type of pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as most of you know already that
are looking at these pieces, some of you
[SPEAKER_02]: may recognize and know these pieces and
for those that don't, I can assure you
[SPEAKER_02]: they're definitely some of the most
incredible artistically created pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the most sophisticated and unique
glass on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: As he's taking a dab, I'll talk about this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the smoke volume two piece that
Marcel did for the book compilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was talking to him, he sort of
described it as a totem piece for him
[SPEAKER_01]: because the phoenix and the octopus are
both very close animal spirits for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very large, chugs very hard,
not necessarily the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best for anything but hash,
really, because as you can hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chugs crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get this hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really nice thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful full melt that the bubble
man has provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, it's... Plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: 150 grams, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It melts into a lovely liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is absolutely a stunner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think a lot of people even realize
that the phoenix is coming out of the top
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost so subtle the way the wings
are holding the top disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm going to give him a shot of
this because it's a giant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll photograph it as well and we'll make
sure that we insert pictures as we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about the different parts of the
pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show some nice close-ups for you
because that's just...
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a nice treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torched up.
[SPEAKER_02]: She fills up nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That phoenix almost right up to the head,
right up to the neck, that smoke line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this one I haven't smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't smoked out of this one,
out of Singularity, or out of... This is
[SPEAKER_02]: the Bach Marcel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bach Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a name for this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an anglerfish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done as part of the Project 33 at
Living Glassworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really couldn't have had a greater
selection of pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this is a beefcake piece,
I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is quite something to have someone go
and pass this over to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is generally not passed over at
concerts when you're just at a fish show
[SPEAKER_02]: and you turn around and someone's like,
hey, did you want to take a hit of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though Fish 2000 was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Marcel, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me have...
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, chugger.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that old school can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how perfect the ready lines are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going down into the foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the ready lines are kind of off the
chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're completely over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a radicello that just continues
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old school can stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the downstem... Like, you can see
it's grommeted in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there is a lot of difficulty taking
the downstem out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to take it all out,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the downstem is about that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to be the one charged with
that job.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, certainly not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's Marcel's totem piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's sort of the way to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't claim it as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say it's his totem piece,
just in conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea, though, because it's... I
mean, I've bought, of course, Marcel's
[SPEAKER_02]: first two pieces of his first three from
1999, Marcel 1 and 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he only did three pieces that year,
and they were all octopus- and
[SPEAKER_02]: fish-oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of kept up and played along
with that octopus theme for a few more
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the Fish 2000 pipes with the
Dolphins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up... I think it was around
01 or 02.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to remember, maybe, when he did the
first Goddess piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember him bringing it over,
and it was this beautiful orange and
[SPEAKER_02]: yellow incredible piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, from there on,
he found himself doing the Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember he actually brought the
Phoenix, the first Phoenix piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a sculpture, a huge sculpture.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought it to the Degenerate Art Show
that Slinger and I threw at the Melville
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the one that he did on his own,
not the one that him and... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: this was a sculpture, a giant,
huge sculpture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had a bowl, and it had a bubbler in
sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was from Degenerate Art 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was from Degenerate Art 1,
and it was a giant, clear phoenix that was
[SPEAKER_02]: five feet tall coming up out of the sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was completely over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: He drove it up in his little truck,
and the crate was literally filled at the
[SPEAKER_02]: back of his truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he showed up with that piece...
[SPEAKER_02]: First, it was Jason Lee and Hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent the motorcycle in.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that piece showed up, we all said,
okay, nothing else has to show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an art show right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the time that it happened and whatnot,
and Hops being unknown, and Jason Lee just
[SPEAKER_02]: being at a level of... I mean,
he's always been killing it, but he was
[SPEAKER_02]: just really killing it so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that motorcycle showed up,
and we were like, okay, we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Marcel showed up with the crate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really good to fucking go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hops was not blowing your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we should move to the
buckfish piece, because singularity,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very fragile, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to have a lot of open space.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, it's a nail with a dome,
and the pipe comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll leave this guy to last.
[SPEAKER_02]: This buck and Marcel piece is absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I saw a photo of it,
I want to say it was maybe Meguido who had
[SPEAKER_02]: it in his hand, but maybe it was a
different one that he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a buck, one of these fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, buck is known for doing the fish
design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, completely over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, buck is just how everybody knows
absolutely... I love this really thin stem
[SPEAKER_02]: that comes into the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way you can hold it with this
giant ball is just, it's really quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to load it up and take the first
hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking heady pieces for a long
time, so I have to say I'm fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable holding them and passing them
around, but there really is an unsaid
[SPEAKER_02]: etiquette in puffing with people's head
pieces of this level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to be smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be moving all quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be... I mean,
for instance, when I rolled up here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my keys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wear my keys around my neck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first thing I did when I got
around this glass was I took them off my
[SPEAKER_02]: neck and I put them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any type of a necklace with a medallion or
even those glass beads sometimes or metal
[SPEAKER_02]: discs like leaning into a headpiece like
this could really put you in an
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomfortable situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've stopped wearing a lot of glass
pendants just for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even what you just did, you know,
just the way Flav just put his arm around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just put his arm in between these two
pieces to grab a piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He owns these pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can do that, but to be someone else and
to just think that you can do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: to clip something, it's just so... The
glass deserves a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean you have to be like
walking, you know, all super scared and
[SPEAKER_02]: not confident.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have confident when you hold
glass like this, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you really want to move a little bit
slower than you normally do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitting my first buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcel Colab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I can quickly just go off
camera for two seconds, I'll go get the
[SPEAKER_01]: attachment that makes it the anglerfish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I see that next to the Max's?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was next to the Max Collins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might as well bring that little dry
Max piece out, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really beautiful, dry Max piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just held it up to the light and it was
just all amber color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took a few photos, all inserted into the
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... So that's the angler piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what... This is one of those fish,
exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: With the light that hangs off the front of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking to see if it was a dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, it would not be fucking sick
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the little sliding... That is a real
special piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've got to give it up to
these guys that are just taking this
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got opals and joint spots here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that in between the two fins
back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The eyes are the most ridiculous
Ratticello discs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's...
[SPEAKER_01]: The color other than the white ready is a
depth of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But... Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll take that for you.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to actually put it upside down like
that and see the bowl from that
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Max Pollen break.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the little Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's like a little Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked volume, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean a little Max.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you know Max.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't generally make pieces...
[SPEAKER_02]: Really small.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes to make some nice big ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is absolute beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I held it up to the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you guys in the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just came out yellowy gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice looking piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a dry piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherlock Lake Reef thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which volume of smoke is this piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoked volume two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoked volume two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have smoked volume one, but it's a... It
would take up a large chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a much bigger piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavy, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet much heavier than any of the pieces
on this table.
[SPEAKER_02]: More likely the weight of that piece and
that piece combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really should get some D line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hit straight hits very often like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, since I got the D nail,
and you have the D nail, you can pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much put it in most of these pieces,
which is a nice thing to just be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: hold out that bowl and throw it into
another 14 piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would fit in pretty much any of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I tried, it does not fit into
Singularity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Singularity is... You hit
Singularity how you don't start modifying
[SPEAKER_02]: a piece like Singularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should hit Singularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to roll a couple of dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: This section here is filled with... I
believe it's Argon gas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Argon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Argon gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When placed onto the base, it blows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move your finger around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates that electric... Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll set it up later on and do a little
video for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pipe itself is just this little
guy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dicro, Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Marcel was talking about it,
it was something like 35 of these were
[SPEAKER_01]: needed just to get these three to match.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pieces, a collaboration obviously by
Delene Peralta, Aaron Siverson,
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcel Braun, and Robert Mickelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all gods of the glass game.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's doubled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one on the bottom as well as
the top of the dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take the one on the end and
then when you pass it back to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just pull that one off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just great to hit all these pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just such a beautiful piece of
glass and I love the way they created.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that Flavos didn't
really talk about that all these little
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces, all these little pieces around,
each one of them comes off the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess if you want to...
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, if I could just give my
quick opinion here is to have every single
[SPEAKER_01]: piece, a singular entity to be able to
come off and then come together to create
[SPEAKER_01]: the larger art form, much like any of us
has small individual aspects that come
[SPEAKER_01]: together to create the single self.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel this pipe on such a different
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is such a true work of art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not here every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that was Robert Mickelson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of his art for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a lot of that and he does it well
and these are impeccable.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these little guys that go around the
base, they're all joining hands and feet
[SPEAKER_02]: and knees and they're making the pattern
of... That's just really quite an
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fit and singularity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of all the pieces that I hit,
I hit them all dry before I tried them and
[SPEAKER_02]: this one, it really grabs you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a deep chubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcel's doing that rash pool for me,
but he just got back from Europe so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take some...
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm definitely down with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to just heat it up there and then
I'll just heat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to put the dome on there for
me too or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you get a dome list?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put the dome on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a dome list that would work on
it, but it just... There's something about
[SPEAKER_01]: having these beautiful rainbow diaper
already tomes that are on it that just
[SPEAKER_01]: make it that much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bless up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty stoked to be hitting this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at the little opal right in the
drip at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't have even noticed it if my
fingers weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really, truly a beautiful piece of
art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they all are truly beautiful
pieces of art, but yeah, this one's
[SPEAKER_01]: special.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: An absolute stunning collection by
anyone's standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the nicest Marcel's on the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: With impeccable artist collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost speechless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the glass truly does speak for
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very little that we can do to
enhance its quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's truly deserving of the melty hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can honestly say, pieces like this,
you want people smoking the absolute
[SPEAKER_02]: nicest possible resins that they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me over, Flav.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, dude, it's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to definitely have to
bring... You're going to have to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: something along this lines next year for
the Legends of Hash Party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll literally have a corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually going to bring this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fab eggs, they're just so popular
these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to have a line up to the
Hubble Bubble and a line up to one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these epic pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, your friend, the owner of the Hubble
Bubblies, when he saw the mothership piece
[SPEAKER_01]: that I brought, he was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a collector of pipes that are
hundreds of years old, let alone... He was
[SPEAKER_01]: very impressed with the fab egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to take some of this out
there to show him because he's a true
[SPEAKER_01]: historical collector of pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would love to.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be sending him the link to this show
so he can watch this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes to be unnamed, but he knows who
he is and we're thinking about you and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're dedicating this show to you because
your Hubble Bubblies, those pipes and
[SPEAKER_02]: those bowls, they're special and I feel
honored every year when he brings them to
[SPEAKER_02]: Legends to allow us to smoke out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, being a pipe collector is one of
the highlights of my year, being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke out of... We're talking about the
Hubbly Bubbly pipes now, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani water pipes that are a few hundred
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made by the Afghani man who
supposedly invented the water pipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: to all historical documented knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people like me and other collectors
out there that have collections like stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, to be able to puff out of
Afghani water pipes that are hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like pouring libations to the Greek
gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: With high-end 2013 resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff they were not smoking 400 years ago
necessarily.
