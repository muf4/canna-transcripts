[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here and it is Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually heading down right now to a
little place nearby where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually where the ferry terminal is
called Horseshoe Bay and Johnny B is
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting me down there right now and what I
thought I was going to do, I thought what
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a good idea is we took you to a
couple of cool spots where we enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: puffing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the Horseshoe Bay Park,
we've got Lighthouse, well I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to do Lighthouse but we'll for
sure do, what the heck is the name of the
[SPEAKER_02]: park now?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's spacing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right near Horseshoe Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's the one we're going to go to
for the starter and we'll walk out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll share a little bit of the adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of raining out here today but
that doesn't, that's not going to stop us
[SPEAKER_02]: from rocking on and yeah, I just wanted to
do a quick little introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am now driving on my way to see Johnny B
and I'll be there in all of, oh maybe four
[SPEAKER_02]: or five minutes so we'll see him really
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Johnny B's in the house for Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we at our spot?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ordering food, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the Olive and Anchor in Horseshoe
Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera's totally dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to order food before anything
happens so that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Triple express.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to get puffed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Johnny B, the food just came when
you got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cajun chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show that food porn off to the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food porn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this should be hash in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself got the crispy cod tacos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about these with a little bit
of french fries and you're filming on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you Snapchatting over there,
Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Snapchatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're gonna eat and then we're
gonna puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well Johnny and I have arrived
here at the parking lot in Horseshoe Bay
[SPEAKER_02]: which is coincidentally enough where this
trail starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Private property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Private property.
[SPEAKER_02]: No trespassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Danger, danger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't a very long trail,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'll be good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you watch your step so you
don't have any slippages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figured we would do this spot first.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit more of a trail here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it heads in to the area of that
house, past that gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big five acre property here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole mountain actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're gonna have a puff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's set our little selves up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we have acquired ourselves
into the first position.
[SPEAKER_02]: Horseshoe Bay epicness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, get that hoodie on there,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a hoodie on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the loudness of my torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're D-nail-less today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're torching it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: John with the full-blown mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there water in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do it while it's... You should change
your torch a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty fucking trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life just isn't the same without ya.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll have no gas left in that torch in
about three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a setting on the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hook you up with mine, bro,
if you need be.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of torch are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got myself a blazer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually Flav's torch that he left at
my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always hooks it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he left it accidentally,
but yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does always hook it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about Flav 421.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy is like, I almost lost my dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't lose your dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't hit it that hot either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're outside, I will do a little
bit of a different time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually let these things go for a minute
to a minute and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: My particular one, not John's quartz,
but this particular ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just gonna hit my timer real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna look at that fairy that I love
so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna dab to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you like, my good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be right behind ya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoodless and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you on the carb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny forgot his carb today, so what are
friends for?
[SPEAKER_02]: If not to carb one another's mothership,
rosin turp dipped, fuck yeah, rip.
Correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say that properly?
[SPEAKER_02]: You forgot the water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, let's put some in mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I think you forgot the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're right now at 3940, so he's like
perfectly on par.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: What will turf it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Karma's bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Karma's bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the win.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the win.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm coming in behind you,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at 55 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Double capping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: That little sizzle from those turps,
just not just any turp, but the dip.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not double dipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: As if D would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Triple dip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bong rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, it's 416.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: 416.
[SPEAKER_02]: 416, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got four more minutes to 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably gonna do 420 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a 420 down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love standing on the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that if I was on concrete,
this very well may have broke,
[SPEAKER_02]: but did you see how I caught it with my
foot first?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there was the kick, and then I did
the, I tried to hacky it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When dropping your carb cap on the side of
a mountain, a little hacky sack might take
[SPEAKER_02]: care of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go, Johnny.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta feel so much better after having a
puff on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday's just not the same without
puffing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same without you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys, like, we're ocean bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 420 bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna catch you guys in a few
minutes in a different place.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so here we are, White Cliff
Park on a little adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been here.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I came in the corner, I was,
like, trying to, like, I want to,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, take a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wow, this is, like,
it's a good spot.
It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take us there, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, like, puffin spots for V.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, I love, I love the scenery and
what we can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these trails are great.
Super epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do a quick peek on the water here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's little benches everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tug boat pulling some trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, this is it, White Hills Park,
but I think, I think, I think we can do
[SPEAKER_02]: better than this.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So follow me, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am following you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mothership's great and the pelican
case, you know, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, whoo, drop the pelican right
away.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it splits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to get over we want to go back
this way because otherwise there's a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: little beach that goes down there and it's
real private, but I want to take you to
[SPEAKER_02]: this rock over here and we'll have a nice
little couple of puffs overlooking the
[SPEAKER_02]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, beautiful trees in this park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little cove right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where I want to take us, and I have
some beautiful drone footage that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a much sunnier day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice the transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the real, authentic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny!
[SPEAKER_02]: There you are!
[SPEAKER_02]: There you are!
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always pay attention to my feet where
I'm stepping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go over to that island and
walk across those rocks and then go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: other side and have a little sesh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say I'd be lying if I said I
don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take us 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got to our spot Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the safest spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really good right here I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a nice little zone here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother ship safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have a sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to have a sit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the tide might be going up right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always is going up and down so you're
50-50 on that one anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found ourselves a good spot here on
the peninsula as you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice drop down behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is where we're going to set
up a nice little sesh for Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be the last sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we're going to make it to
the third spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if not, let's get this sesh started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright we made our spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's honing in on the sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like what's up boys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Heard you guys got that ethical groan
dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like I heard you got some solventless
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So solventless in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like a seagull.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like the goat of birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best thing about how relaxed
and peaceful it is with the type of vibe
[SPEAKER_03]: that you give off as in just being a
positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the seagull wants to hang out with
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude these guys are pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright well we're hitting dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still getting my terps out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No dab pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise put that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you saw the drop with the pelican case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see the drop with the pelican case.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh I know what I need still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Risk free.
[SPEAKER_02]: My torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you feeling a breeze?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get some dabs first before I
heat this up actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the terps right here that we'll
be dipping in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some of the rosin from Pathlife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pathlife.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Pathlife Puff Wednesday actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think we hit anything else
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well and some Blue River.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some Blue River.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some Blue River in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you going to hang out?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like I'll be waiting to see this shit
my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terps are right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps are real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And rosin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbering right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys puffing on at Pathlife
Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_02]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love to see your comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you're from and what you're puffing
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's a flower, the cultivar of the
flower, the rosin, the extract,
[SPEAKER_02]: some form of concentrate, a mechanical
screen separation, whether dry or wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you make it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Share it with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you an artist?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like me to dip your dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you dip me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the two dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did a little puff down with Dana
Larson.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had two joints in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Dana do that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: How to get a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ok you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: My phone's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even time this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: John spends $1,900 a month on his phone
taking selfies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was telling me earlier off camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phone bills are expensive up here in
Canada though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Play around and then we don't send you a
bill for three months to send you a
[SPEAKER_03]: threatening text message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like why am I talking through my
skull.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just kind of a do as you need to do
kind of guy you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't do that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a pipe in your hand and a torch
in the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dab is quite important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah those Karma bitch terpenes are off
the chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have a quartz and he has a
ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't wait much more than 50 seconds
on yours total.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do about 35 because I don't have a carb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh but you have the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: See I seem to forget the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I forgot the whole quartz
banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I brought the drop down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine didn't get that hot surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna hit it soon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How soon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon enough so I at least get a rip and
it's not all cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cold out here and the wind is really
cold out here so you definitely have to
[SPEAKER_02]: adjust how long you let your bowl cool for
a lot different time than you would
[SPEAKER_02]: normally in like a room temperature room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably about 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big-ass boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll need that in about 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass that thing right over.
[SPEAKER_03]: The glass is already nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really nice day Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of vessel do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a sea bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got passengers in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a BC fairy flag on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a BC flag sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No I've never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait I don't know if you guys can see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coastal something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to let them see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they saw him fly away.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: John says he's like fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually still have some left on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well nice enjoyable puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best thing about a puff Wednesday is
it's the middle of the week and it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: time that you would look back at the
beginning of the week and look forward to
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean the puff Wednesday for me is
kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like okay you know what the day's
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a puff relax and take a look at
how the first of the week went.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm gonna look forward to the end of
the week the weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it's a great it's a great day to
just kind of think back and hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Middle of the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Middle of the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But puff Wednesday is yeah it's a nice
time to just travel around check things
[SPEAKER_02]: out get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what kind of puff Wednesday from my
perspective is is to get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go I like the idea of us not just sitting
in the same spot all the time but making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that we're in a different environment
each time to sort of show you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna flip the camera around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little BC culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just flip flip the camera and show
the
[SPEAKER_02]: fall colors are coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had the drone but I am going to
show them a bit of drone footage from a
[SPEAKER_02]: sunny day when there were some kids
jumping off that rock over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I can hear in my head right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bump a bump a bump a bump a bump bump
bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the end credits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sharing your puff Wednesday
with us everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B has always a pleasure my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
