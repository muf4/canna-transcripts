[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world and
today I'm here to talk to you a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about one of my favorite tools that I use
on a regular basis you guys see me
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling all over the world with this
tool and although most of you are probably
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking it's the mothership it's actually
the D nail that I wanted to talk to you
[SPEAKER_01]: about today so this is my 2.0 from the
from the good folks at D nail Stevie
[SPEAKER_01]: Hughes and Brian Schroeder and I've been
working with this company for maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit less than a year now I'm
relatively new to the whole dabbing scene
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got turned on first via the
sublimator and quickly found that the ease
[SPEAKER_01]: and the wonderful just hit that you get
from it from an electronic nail in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular the D nail because that's the
company that I ended up going with after
[SPEAKER_01]: doing my research I found that the guys at
D nail are really pioneering and moving
[SPEAKER_01]: things forward they're not just looking at
copying an existing company that's out
[SPEAKER_01]: there but they've done a lot of basically
they did a lot of what I did as as bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: bags and bubble man when I first came out
I was as you know I was not the first
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble bag or bag company to release the
water extraction process there was one
[SPEAKER_01]: other company before myself and that was a
two bag system and I feel that D nail has
[SPEAKER_01]: really done I guess it's customer base a
service much the way bubble bags has done
[SPEAKER_01]: its customer base a service because as you
remember in the beginning bubble bags was
[SPEAKER_01]: a two bag kit quickly became a three four
five six seven and eight bag kit and that
[SPEAKER_01]: increased the quality of the product and
it increased the quality of the final
[SPEAKER_01]: product that the customer was able to get
so I was gonna take you through a few
[SPEAKER_01]: things that D nail sent me recently
they've been sending me so much stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really made a perfect video just
for them so I wanted to I guess first go
[SPEAKER_01]: over the old titanium nail that they have
they've got a two-piece nail here I do
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it's just a two-piece yeah the
bottom part does not screw off on this one
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's a 14-4 no matter what and then the
old style of element is right here and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how you attach that so this is the
old tie nail a 14-4 and this was the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that I used with D nail for for any time
that my quartz banger wasn't working which
[SPEAKER_01]: I have on here right now a puking bead is
a little bit dirty sorry that it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit cleaner but that's the puking
bead and that's the 20 mil coil so the the
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl is a little bit bigger than say the
16 which you can see right here comparably
[SPEAKER_01]: they are quite a bit of a different size
one fits the ceramic disc as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: sapphire disc a lot better and that would
be this one and this is the one that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna do the sapphire hits on I will talk
a little bit about this puking be quartz
[SPEAKER_01]: really like this this was my savior in
Amsterdam this year because I pooched my
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 mil cord I pooched my 20 mil cord and I
was forced to use a smaller cord which I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not even sure if I have that particular
cord present here oh here it is right here
[SPEAKER_01]: so this is the new Kevlar wrapped whips
that D nail are selling now and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see that this particular coil is a 16 so
it fits that bowl perfectly and in fact it
[SPEAKER_01]: also fits the new titanium nail so let me
show you a little bit about what these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys have done they've made it a wonderful
that you can screw off the part this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the 14th that fits into my bowl you can
screw this off and you can get it in
[SPEAKER_01]: either 18 or 14 so you don't have to
replace your whole nail now the nail is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit different in the sense that the
coil is going to go around the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nail much like the quartz bangers and
they've offset the hole to the side and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite a deep dish so you can really
fill that up if you're looking to take
[SPEAKER_01]: monster rips I also like the way they've
allowed it to split in half and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to collect some of that condensed
reclaim this is really wonderful stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on skin elements this is great
stuff for removing moles or putting on
[SPEAKER_01]: scars anything that you've got on your
skin that you're kind of not digging the
[SPEAKER_01]: oil that condenses in these nails is
really an effective medicine for those
[SPEAKER_01]: exterior skin problems you could also use
it to cook into Meta bowls and etc but I
[SPEAKER_01]: just personally use it on different skin
things that I have I actually removed a
[SPEAKER_01]: mole from my neck using this very thing so
let me just get to the next part here I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a couple of other quartz bangers from
Pooking Bee these are dirty ones they're
[SPEAKER_01]: both direct injection so this one's
obviously a slide that just fits into the
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl and this one's an actual you know
goes on proper you've seen me use this
[SPEAKER_01]: before on the Dosa from Flav so I've also
got the new dog house from D-Nail which is
[SPEAKER_01]: the quartz banger all Pooking Bee quartz
with a quartz dabber with a quartz cap so
[SPEAKER_01]: a carb cap so while you drop your your
head into there you cap the hole as well
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately I broke this one in
Amsterdam but how it works simply put is
[SPEAKER_01]: you use the coil it goes around like that
and then it had it had a U on it that went
[SPEAKER_01]: around and dipped into the piece some of
you may or may not have seen that on the
[SPEAKER_01]: channel earlier but today what I wanted to
really talk about was the new D-Nail
[SPEAKER_01]: inserts these sapphire inserts are
absolutely killer I'm not joking the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceramic was not even comparable they sent
me both their black ceramic and their
[SPEAKER_01]: white ceramic a variety of white ceramics
as D-Nail was looking to get the best
[SPEAKER_01]: possible ceramic that they that they could
get and on a side note speaking of ceramic
[SPEAKER_01]: Hive has a ceramic bowl that now D-Nail is
working with so I'm really happy to see
[SPEAKER_01]: Hive and D-Nail working together to
produce the utmost quality of ceramic
[SPEAKER_01]: because as you know when we heat these
things up if we're using cheaper materials
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be off gassing and
there's going to be things that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to bring into our lungs so without
further ado I guess right off the bat I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take just a straight rip I got
some real nice Astro Boy melty bubble here
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've had curing for months so we'll
just do a little quick rip of the Astro
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy and yes I'm using a Hive ceramic carb
cap dash gabber great little tool I picked
[SPEAKER_01]: up in Amsterdam as well I picked up a
highly educated Task Rock gift from my
[SPEAKER_01]: good buddy Buddha from Ohio thank you so
much Alex really nice kick down and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: been using it quite a bit but it is in my
other bag and that's why it's not here god
[SPEAKER_01]: the taste on that Astro Boy is candy like
so we're gonna open one of these ceramic
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry sapphire the sapphire inserts one of
the things that I really love about the
[SPEAKER_01]: sapphire insert is that it just hits so
smoothly it's it's it breathes a different
[SPEAKER_01]: way than the ceramic that I've hit so far
I find that when it's on the sapphire that
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems to give me more of a hit like as
if it was on a screen that wasn't plugged
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to being on a screen that was
very plugged up with carbon and ash I just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get the same pull and same taste but
the sapphire I'll tell you it has really
[SPEAKER_01]: opened my mind to enjoying hitting bowls
with the insert now originally these yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: these inserts were originally designed to
go inside I guess I guess they were
[SPEAKER_01]: originally designed to go inside this kind
of a nail my nail of course is a special
[SPEAKER_01]: nail let me see this one might have it yes
this one originally when they made me my
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium nail I asked them to shave down
the middle piece so you can see in this
[SPEAKER_01]: one it's been shaved down and because it
got shaved down the sapphire piece does
[SPEAKER_01]: not fit and funny enough that's why I
started placing my sapphire on top and I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess a lot of people are doing this now
it wasn't really a tech as much as it was
[SPEAKER_01]: a mistake and Brian laughed quite loud
that's how it was supposed to fit this is
[SPEAKER_01]: how these are supposed to fit on your nail
they go right inside however I never hit
[SPEAKER_01]: them like that personally I love the idea
of placing it on top of a quartz and then
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing the the viewer to see the hit
melting and bubbling away so without
[SPEAKER_01]: further ado why don't we do that why don't
we throw one of these ceramic stacks on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the D nail and give you guys a
little show
[SPEAKER_03]: is not here to trick the mind it is only
here to do its purpose of time is not here
[SPEAKER_03]: to trick the mind it is only here to do
its purpose of time
[SPEAKER_01]: all right so that was the tastiest of rips
that was the CBD Rene that first rip on
[SPEAKER_01]: the sapphire insert I can't even begin to
explain to you the level of taste that is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming off of that not your standard Rene
or your standard can a tonic but a mixture
[SPEAKER_01]: of the two fruity fruity goodness no doubt
about it very impressed and that was Matt
[SPEAKER_01]: Baron from the house of the great gardener
who crossed a can a tonic with a Rene to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with his CBD Rene really delicious
stuff I have very very very little of it
[SPEAKER_01]: left but there's what it looks like and
this is just dry sift that's been cleaned
[SPEAKER_01]: to 99% heads or so so next up what we're
gonna hit is we're going to hit some of
[SPEAKER_01]: D420K's dry sift this is OG Kush he gave
this to me probably a year ago now close
[SPEAKER_01]: to a year ago because I believe I went up
there in December to visit him last time
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's when he gave me this it's in
one of the 420 jars so it's one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: glass light proof jars and I'll tell you
this is some greasy greasy shit I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure if it's gonna allow the camera to
grab on but you know what why don't we
[SPEAKER_01]: show you a little bit of a better light
over here alright so here is the D420K
[SPEAKER_00]: sift see if I can get you guys in a little
bit to see how this stuff just absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: greased right out that is dry sift no wet
washing on this particular resin pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: goopy stuff let's have a rip
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow that D420K sift was explosive I'm sure
you guys saw it on the sapphire insert the
[SPEAKER_01]: way it seemed to grease from the outside
out just the way the water almost water
[SPEAKER_01]: like substance seemed to just release and
melt puddling across that sapphire insert
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you I was excited as I saw it I
got to take a really nice hit very strong
[SPEAKER_01]: still a year later well cured in the jar I
haven't been keeping it in anything other
[SPEAKER_01]: than room temperature I've lost this thing
probably 10 times since he gave it to me
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the only reason I have some left so
that was a beautiful taste I think what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna finish it off with D nail
style is some well I've got the Astro Boy
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift and I've got the sweet skunk so I
mean let's finish it off with sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little bit of the sift right here
beautiful beautiful stuff super melty I
[SPEAKER_01]: had this at the cannabis cup with me and
it was holding its own amongst everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that I saw I saw some beautiful hashes
from the likes of the the trichome heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts guys the melts Tony had some
amazing terpene added stuff the turp melt
[SPEAKER_01]: Ramon who won first at legends had some
incredible dry sift a few other friends
[SPEAKER_01]: brought really nice dry sift and some
other nice wet washes that I saw while I
[SPEAKER_01]: was there including archive Fletch brought
some nice stuff from Cuban grower and
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B had some stuff from Horatio all
in all the dry sift was lovely and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: happy to say that the sweet skunk as clean
as it was held its own with all of them so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what we're gonna finish this video
off with if you guys have any questions
[SPEAKER_01]: about D nails please get in touch with me
whether it's in regards to the quartz
[SPEAKER_01]: bowls the new tie bowls the whips the
units all the different levels I'm hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: on having my own bubble man edition D nail
out soon and even without that I still of
[SPEAKER_01]: course support the company and we'll be
selling their regular products which you
[SPEAKER_01]: can check out at fresh Heddy's dot-com

[SPEAKER_01]: one at the start of Heddy's one word fresh
Heddy's so yeah let's finish it off with a
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet skunk bowl guys after we get by this
expression the purpose of the wheel is not
[SPEAKER_03]: here to trick the mind it is only here to
do its purpose of time Banja is not here
[SPEAKER_03]: to trick the mind it is only here to do
its purpose of time
[SPEAKER_01]: well that was absolutely delicious the
sweet skunk is one of my favorites it's
[SPEAKER_01]: got this fruity slightly sweet taste but
really what it's got is an overwhelming
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic sativa haze taste that you get on
the exhale as well as when you smell it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air absolute pleasure I definitely
urge you if you can find the sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: in its pure form not the island sweet
skunk that's a good second if you can find
[SPEAKER_01]: it only but if you can find the sweet
skunk it is a strain worth having in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden so I'm gonna leave you guys at that

[SPEAKER_01]: of the D nail and some of the tools that
they're pioneering along with their
