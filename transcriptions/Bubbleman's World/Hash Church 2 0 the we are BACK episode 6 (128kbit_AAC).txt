[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, what's going on, strangers?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think over 140 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, everyone, to Bubble Man's World,
and welcome to Hash Church 2.0,
[SPEAKER_05]: episode six.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that was a serious break.
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you that don't know,
we basically took a four-month hiatus
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the request of YouTube, I lost my
ability to stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very, very happy that they gave it
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to welcome everyone into the room,
into the chat room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so stoked to be here and so stoked to
see all these familiar names, as they
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't faces.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are names in a chat room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get right to it and send off
the link to the people who are waiting
[SPEAKER_05]: this morning for the link to come in and
spend a little bit of time with us today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to do a couple of hours,
I think, depending on the conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm very, very, very excited to be
back at Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed it, I swear, as much as you guys
did.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a special thing that we have here,
and it was kind of sad when I thought I
[SPEAKER_05]: was going to lose my ability to stream
forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in a 90-day probation on YouTube,
and after 90 days, I went to stream,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they did not let me stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: After 100 days, they did not let me
stream, and it kept going on and on and
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was relentless and persistent,
and I kept checking every single day to
[SPEAKER_05]: see if we could get back on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the most familiar face ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Etienne's going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I'd be hearing people say,
we can't hear you, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's Etienne Fontaine in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: First time in over 140 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good to see you, even though
you can't hear me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you can hear me, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like you're like my long-lost
brother that I haven't seen in forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: 140 days?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hash Church was our connection,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've barely seen, hide, nor hair of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you've got all sorts of wonderful
things to share with us this morning,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I hope you've been well above all
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been well, and I hope the same to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you've been traveling around the
world, and definitely missed the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to hang and to see what's
going on, because it's also been my
[SPEAKER_03]: connection as well, because I've been
underwater.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been legal here in California,
and it's been insanity peppers,
[SPEAKER_03]: to say the least.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a whole new set of clientele and
people who are coming through the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been all kinds of craziness,
but it's been a wonderful challenge and
[SPEAKER_03]: one that we've been able to live up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just trying to keep up with all the
craziness.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still don't have permanent regulations
here in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still dealing in the temporary
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I see there's a lot of changes
happening up there in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a lot of changes happening to
your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a lot of consolidation
happening right now, people buying each
[SPEAKER_03]: other up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an interesting 140 plus days,
to say the least.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been up to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been keeping busy for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went and enjoyed Spannabis there for a
little bit, and that was a wonderful
[SPEAKER_05]: event.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up in Mallorca after that with
these wonderful people, Danny and Grace,
[SPEAKER_05]: who were just gracious hosts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spent four days there with my friend
Sean, Lost Gardens on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as the Maple Butter Boys,
and then came home and have just been one
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity after another.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually in Toronto right now for the
Lyft Conference, which has been going
[SPEAKER_05]: really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a huge, monstrous conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all sorts of people on both sides
of the invisible fence that invisibly
[SPEAKER_05]: divides us.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, we're all in this cannabis
industry together, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: division.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear, of course, the people who have
licensed production facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of them, but some of them are
feeling a little shorthanded by the
[SPEAKER_05]: investments they've had to make,
the hoops they've had to jump through,
[SPEAKER_05]: and how, of course, dispensaries don't
have to jump through those hoops.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually producing profits and
selling products, while the other ones are
[SPEAKER_05]: not.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the long run, there's good people on
both sides, and I'm pretty excited to just
[SPEAKER_05]: see the industry growing every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right back at you, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's everything?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a haircut, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a haircut recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went with my son, and we both got
haircuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, I'm not wearing a hat, and I'm
always wearing a hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So today, I was like, I'm going to go in a
hat shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I sent the link out to Forrest as
well today, so hopefully he'll be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: stop in and share some knowledge with us
about the Colladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you been up to, Wade,
in the last 140 days since last we saw
[SPEAKER_05]: you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colladrius Network, I have a new empathy
for people who are in pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I destroyed my back this spring and had
emergency surgery seven weeks ago today,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I thought I would never do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the pain stopped immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: The surgeon took bone off of three
vertebrae and took material from two
[SPEAKER_06]: different discs in my back, and I have
severe restrictions on activity for the
[SPEAKER_06]: next six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not a farmer this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a person who's going to be helping
people understand how to use cannabis as
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine and all the different ways that
can happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And meantime, in our area, I'm going to be
helping the farmers who are providing for
[SPEAKER_06]: Colladrius Network or trying to get into
the regulated marketplace here in
[SPEAKER_06]: California, any kind of help that I can
offer them about how to fit into the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated marketplace and succeed in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many barriers have been put up to
especially small farmers having any chance
[SPEAKER_06]: at all in this new marketplace in
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what, as crazy as it is,
first, go ahead, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been a real frustration.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we embrace 64 and the change
that happened, and then the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, created a lot of rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the main realities is they
allowed for counties and municipalities to
[SPEAKER_03]: vote out cannabis altogether.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has been extremely limiting
across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bill currently in the state
trying to allow for deliveries in areas
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're barred from having any type
of distribution points in the sense of
[SPEAKER_03]: retail outlets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been frustrating to watch many a
farmer have to go back into the
[SPEAKER_03]: underground because of the inability to
afford to come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been frustrating to watch many a
farmer have to go back into this real
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to bootstrap it ourselves,
and we're one of the more successful ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was still very challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still frustrating for us that are
able to move forward in this situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's even more frustrating to see all
those that were in the system and that
[SPEAKER_03]: were being successful now left on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to show this up, and we have
to fix this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have faith in you guys as being
the right people to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say, I'm very sorry to hear
about your back and your surgery,
[SPEAKER_05]: Wade, but I'm glad that it worked out for
you and that you're pain free.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, you're still doing the good
work of job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to welcome Forrest from the
Caladrius Network, and I want to welcome
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric from Forever Flowering Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say I want to say,
guys, you know, it wasn't too long ago
[SPEAKER_05]: that our lives were being destroyed in a
very different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were being jailed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were having our dog shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were having our kids taken away.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were having all these things that was
at such a different level that the
[SPEAKER_05]: obstacles we have now, as horrible as they
are, they are nothing compared to what
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been dealing with for the last 40
plus years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that we're strong enough to get
through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may hear us bitching a little bit
about these difficult regulations and the
[SPEAKER_05]: way good people are being sort of forced
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to fight for those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to continue the fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at least, at least, at least,
we're not being imprisoned for 10 and 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's not forget it wasn't that long
ago that they were doing that to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, it's good to see everyone again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said, too, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a it's been a hole for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a hole in the in the in my
world, not having the church happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it been?
[SPEAKER_02]: One hundred and one hundred and sixty days
or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: One hundred forty days now almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been about that long.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you know, I was I was in YouTube
prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one of my videos struck down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess someone flagged my video of me
smoking a pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: They struck the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they struck the video,
they simultaneously took away my ability
[SPEAKER_05]: to stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to complain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to rock the boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a huge appreciation for the YouTube
platform and for what they offer us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's all sorts of
difficulties with all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_05]: channels right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm personally not going to get into
that discussion today too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely was very, very,
very happy when I and I was searching.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was checking every single day for the
last 40 days, 50 days if I could stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one day I just went on and I went to
stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of saying no streaming allowed
on this channel, it opened up the page and
[SPEAKER_05]: it showed me that I could write a title
and start streaming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was so giddy and so excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, oh, my God, oh, my God,
we're back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really it's really quite frightening
when you have a platform like this,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, suddenly not allow you to do
something that you you know, I don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to say I took it for granted because I
absolutely don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, take for granted all of you
amazing people that both come on the
[SPEAKER_05]: panels and come and spend time in the chat
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely am.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honored beyond honored that for whatever
reason, we've been able to build this
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Forrest said, it was a real hole
in my world as well, not being able to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk with all of you every week on this
Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just so honored and blessed that
it's that we've been given the opportunity
[SPEAKER_05]: to do it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all for coming for coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing to see how about that for
timing as I'm giving thanks and praises
[SPEAKER_05]: the Dragonfly Earth Medicine crew comes
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mika came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So welcome to both of you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got to ask the question the 800
pound gorilla in the room then can we
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing videos where I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would never tell anyone, particularly
someone who just had back surgery that
[SPEAKER_05]: they couldn't use their medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what's up, Sean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost gardens in the house who just stopped
by.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a seat, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us here for some hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, before we do that, I'm going to
say bong rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, welcome Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Mika.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm not sure if you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your question, Wade?
[SPEAKER_06]: No question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it was an excellent observation
he'd shared at the beginning of our
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting that he was taken down because he
was smoking and here we are smoking again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just made an assumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should be able to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure exactly why.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have all sorts of YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been all sorts of drama.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you Google it, you can look into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely am not trying to rock the
YouTube boat in the sense that I'm very,
[SPEAKER_05]: very happy with them giving us permission
to do this chat again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't take hash church for granted.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very important platform.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really realized how important it is
when I was not able to do it for 140 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And towards the end of that 140 days,
I thought I was never going to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: do it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm just very happy to have all
your smiling faces on the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking forward to hearing
everything about what everyone's been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing for the last 140 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I definitely want to hear Josh and
Kelly's voice right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, family.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are so happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm just elated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Marcus, for getting this
up and rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're feeling like it's a regular
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, I could barely sleep last
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excited to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of love to you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big, big healing vibes to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big deal to go through that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many blessings on that continued healing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Forrest and ATN, Micah and Eric and
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just went to pass Sean my pen and he
pulls his own pen out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just great to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to be back in this chat room
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's got 70s mama and Woody Woody
and Melty Heads and John Maddox.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, AJ, DJI.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, who has tears in their eyes?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, this is an emotional.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_05]: No joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: The work that we've been doing on here is
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one of your points as far as
how important this platform is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is really critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ties into why it was taken down to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the main things I think
programs like this do, the work that we do
[SPEAKER_02]: at local and federal and our national
levels, is help to break down that stigma
[SPEAKER_02]: that is tied with cannabis is inherently
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there's something, just if you're
involved with it, there's something
[SPEAKER_02]: inherently bad or dangerous with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is dissolving a little more
slowly than I would like, but it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it causes people to make decisions
that are bad and against their best
[SPEAKER_02]: options for a quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes people to ban in counties like
we talked about here in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's like, it's legal in California,
but we have 85% of the counties still in a
[SPEAKER_02]: ban.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we change the community
perception?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get to hearts and minds,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to share the work we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to put that into the
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to change the context of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really, that's where we're at
with cannabis is still, we need to put the
[SPEAKER_02]: work into the cultural shift of
understanding instead of holding onto this
[SPEAKER_02]: false dichotomy of sin that is somehow
attached to cannabis and really anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that changes your mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this old dogmatic idea that that
equals sin or something bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And platforms like this and some of the
conversations I'm sure we'll get into are
[SPEAKER_02]: critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the impact really can't be
understated or overstated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by having these ability to get to so
many different people share what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: working with, have them working and
sharing and speaking in their communities
[SPEAKER_02]: that we really see the biggest chance for
impact on that cultural shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that cultural shift that is
holding us back in the places that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: still struggling for rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's people like you that have
been very much congratulations to what you
[SPEAKER_03]: have been doing in Sacramento to pass
legislation to actually help others.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working behind the scenes with
the Veterans Cannabis Council and we've
[SPEAKER_03]: been actually, we've got the first bill
out of Congress there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the first bill actually voted out
to allow for research regarding veterans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of things that a lot of
us have been doing in the absence of being
[SPEAKER_03]: here that are pushing forward for positive
change for all, because we can't just sit
[SPEAKER_03]: back and rest in our laurels, but it also,
it reminds us that, and seeing all these
[SPEAKER_03]: injustices of how much work we still have
to continue to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with your successes there in
Sacramento, it's just a drop in the water
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to the watershed moments we need
to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the ability for everybody who's
watching to still get active and get
[SPEAKER_03]: involved is still in peril.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so, to continue to make this momentum
stronger and stronger like we've been able
[SPEAKER_03]: to show at least on the state,
national and federal front, but we still
[SPEAKER_03]: got 41 other states as well as those with
legal still have things we all have to
[SPEAKER_03]: work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully with this legislation coming
up federally, which will supersede the
[SPEAKER_03]: veterans bill that we had going through,
we'll hopefully take it out of schedule
[SPEAKER_03]: one altogether in the United States and
allow for it to proliferate through all 50
[SPEAKER_03]: states so that maybe we can catch up to
you wonderful people in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: since we're still so lagging behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we still need the help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure we'll get into that,
but you know, that's something that having
[SPEAKER_02]: a platform offers is it's the ability to
share with people what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: nationally at the state level and here in
the States and in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on there so that we can steer
people in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know with stuff that we're working
on, I meet people all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, man, if I had a note about that,
I would have loved to participate or get
[SPEAKER_02]: groups together and you know, well,
how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And social media, the internet connecting
with, with folks is the most efficient and
[SPEAKER_02]: best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really happy to be here,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the invite and I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we're going to get into here
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just want to add that although
maybe in the government and in the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: situation, you guys are behind in Canada
is a little bit of a head, but I've always
[SPEAKER_05]: looked to the American activists as my
point of inspiration and the work that you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys have done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly don't feel that you guys are
behind us in your activism in any way,
[SPEAKER_05]: shape or form.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are the leading world activists
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've always looked to you to,
for, for guidance and for direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So bless up.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's the few Americans that
made it up to Canada that are even like
[SPEAKER_09]: more wild because they're just like,
I just want the best of everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, it is kind of crazy with the
way that everything is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, because we're all like the
originators of cannabis and, and,
[SPEAKER_09]: and other people that are out there too,
like the, the, uh, as far as cultivation
[SPEAKER_09]: goes in the culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And many of us farmers are just kind of
struggling to find our place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, there's $2.5 billion deals
being signed all over the place and 59
[SPEAKER_09]: publicly traded companies here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everywhere else you go in the world,
you would just think it was totally legal
[SPEAKER_09]: because the government and the large scale
corporations are a hundred percent,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, acting as if, you know,
they're publicly trading and making deals
[SPEAKER_09]: without even barely having any weed
growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that we've always said this
recently and say in the last year,
[SPEAKER_09]: we really, really need to just stay in
business, whatever that means to each
[SPEAKER_09]: individual, because each individual,
that means something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And staying in business with integrity,
you know, all of these really large,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may seem like cannabis is ahead,
but what kind of a head are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interesting conversation
because all of these really large
[SPEAKER_00]: multinational, multi-international
businesses now are totally joining forces
[SPEAKER_00]: with pharmaceutical companies and they're
going all over the world and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making deals and they're going to be
getting cheaper flowers from Columbia,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Jamaica, from other places all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even going to be looking to
Canadian growers for their flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because maybe this isn't such a great
place to be able to grow the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to go to areas that they can
grow it cheaply, sun grown, and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be cutting out, you know,
the small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been having legislation and
they've been able to set up business,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they haven't even given us our,
our licenses and we don't even know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the beautiful, the beautiful thing
is, is that although it may cut out a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of people in the sense that now this is
going to be a legal business that the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole world is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing I can say from being at the
Lyft conference, there's all sorts of
[SPEAKER_05]: different people from different walks of
life that I've been speaking to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, people that I may have almost
harshly judged years ago through my own
[SPEAKER_05]: potentiation of my own stereotype as a,
as a, as a whatever you want to call me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was more of a hippie mentality and I
would call it kind of call them the Joe
[SPEAKER_05]: Straties, you know, as I'm sitting on Hash
Church looking like a Joe Stratie,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I had some incredible conversations
over the last few days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that really struck
me, whether or not it was about money that
[SPEAKER_05]: was getting people excited or not,
it really felt like these people,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of these people that I met had a,
had a passion for cannabis, had an
[SPEAKER_05]: excitement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they were walking through their lives
as zombies before, and now they were
[SPEAKER_05]: getting into this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just felt like, you know what,
this is just going to be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like people are excited, you know,
they were working in construction or they
[SPEAKER_05]: were doing, you know, mining or they were
doing like, they were working in
[SPEAKER_05]: agriculture, but with cows and chickens
and they were doing all these different
[SPEAKER_05]: things and from all these different walks
of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I speak to each one of them
individually, and spend time with them,
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized that they're just people that
are just trying to live their lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just trying to do good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they have this cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I feel like if you're going to have
cannabis in your life, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: hard set not to have it in, put a positive
influence into your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've used it personally as a
guiding light for, for a couple of decades
[SPEAKER_05]: now, almost three decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was neat to see people for the
first time turning on their cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: flashlight, getting the batteries on and
flicking that switch because you can see
[SPEAKER_05]: it in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a real excitement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously hope that everyone that
wants to be involved gets to be involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, no one's ever going
to be able to stop you from growing your
[SPEAKER_05]: own cannabis the same way you grow your
own flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be able to do it here in
the very near future, for sure in Canada
[SPEAKER_05]: with recreational right around the corner
and over 50 to 60,000 people already
[SPEAKER_05]: federally exempt through the medical
programs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think America is really going to get on
board in the next five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to see federal
legalization down there, the work that
[SPEAKER_05]: people like Etienne and Forrest and all of
these different incredible activists are
[SPEAKER_05]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't be ignored anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just can't be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we were also forced them that they
can't ignore us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing, you know,
now we just that rider.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the bill that we had, we had 52
co-sponsors that's been decades worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: work to get those 52 co-sponsors to put
that on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all this time while people sit around
bitching and complaining, we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: putting in the work by going down there
and lobbying year in and year out and
[SPEAKER_03]: putting in that time so that we not only
had one, we had 52.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now we have a constituency so
strong that if they go against us,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can now shame them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is a total shift in dynamics
that we as veterans can shame them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's Memorial Day this weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to all veterans, including
the drug war veterans, but especially
[SPEAKER_03]: those that have lost their lives because
that's what Memorial Day is to remember
[SPEAKER_03]: those who have lost their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't forget those, you know,
my cousin was killed in war, but I've lost
[SPEAKER_03]: countless other friends in this drug war.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I view them all equally because it's
all shameful what's actually happened to
[SPEAKER_03]: all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it shows that 10, you know,
constant reminders that we have more and
[SPEAKER_03]: more work to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we don't do it ourselves,
you know, no one else is going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 10, you know, gosh, why that would look
to be the one and only would that be the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the man himself most year most year skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people just smiled when they saw
that come on the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic's off, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I had to mute you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but you can unmute yourself and
say hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know lots of people want to hear
your voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and not, not only that is a,
I saw Nick Bradley earlier in a shout out
[SPEAKER_03]: to the, you know, 22 vets a day kill
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to remember that people,
you know, the, the lot of stresses that we
[SPEAKER_03]: go through, and this is a very healing
herb for all, including our soldiers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so never forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially the 22, cause it's more
than 22 that will die today because of
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, so that's why things are
changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that we, I mean, the reality is,
is that we have the moral and ethical high
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the science to back it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, at this point saying we kept the more
science is really just saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't read or looked at it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, there's absolutely the
science there to back it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and what we have now is a group of
activists all over the world, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: that can articulate it in a different way
that kind of breaks down again,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we were talking about, about some of
the social ideological and dogmatic
[SPEAKER_02]: arguments of cannabis being bad,
because it makes you feel funny,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, the fights and, and if you can
hit this perfectly is where the urgency
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from with, with our group and with
the veterans groups we work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really see those two, some of those
two categories to some of the most at
[SPEAKER_02]: risk, um, is that we want the people to
still be around when that day comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's coming, but we want as many
people to survive to see that day as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that it is really
understood how the slow reactions,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the, uh, passivity of lawmakers,
uh, really equates death and lives and
[SPEAKER_02]: cost people their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to hear from Sam too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he gone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he still here?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to also get into ETN's bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear more about it before we go
today for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am here and I want to tape up about one
subject, which was, will the future of
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis be, uh, produced in places like
Columbia and other places?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you look at the cut flower
industry, all of the flowers are produced
[SPEAKER_11]: in Malaysia, Kenya, Columbia, places like
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they, they, they sell 90% of the
flowers produced in the industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, there's a reason why it's,
it's labor costs and, uh, nobody can
[SPEAKER_11]: compete with that to be honest,
but have any of you ever worried about
[SPEAKER_11]: where your cut flowers come from?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want the cheap price.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I see where they come from.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause all the greenhouses in California
are all old cut flower greenhouses that
[SPEAKER_10]: are now converted to cannabis or
converting to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, probably some more cut flower
greenhouses in the last year than I ever
[SPEAKER_10]: thought I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, Santa Barbara County has the most
mixed light licenses in California right
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't grind up my cut flower,
extract it and feed it to my nine year old
[SPEAKER_02]: kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's true too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a different level of expectation
is different.
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, the cut flower industry also
has a lot of organic growers, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: so the stuff is totally clean and safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we're going to be in a unique
position kind of like in the aroma therapy
[SPEAKER_05]: and essential oil world where specific
essential oils express themselves uniquely
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on the different regions that
they're grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And although it might not be the majority
of the marketplace, I think there's always
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be a place in the market for
cannabis grown in specific regions and
[SPEAKER_05]: specific soils with specific sun cycles to
express.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you think about it right now with
beer, whiskey, and wine, none of which I
[SPEAKER_11]: take, but it is a big business and,
uh, it's much better to be a legal
[SPEAKER_11]: business than an illegal business,
but you can buy it from any country in the
[SPEAKER_11]: world.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can buy beer from any country.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can buy wine from any country.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can buy whiskey from any country.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to when the future of
cannabis is that way, that you can buy
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis products from any country in any
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I would love to have the opportunity
to buy Uruguayan cannabis or some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: other countries that are now starting to
produce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of those countries would love
to have some of our California cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the reality is, is those other
countries will be able to produce it for
[SPEAKER_03]: much cheaper and a better quality than
what we'll be able to produce here in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imports will be something that will be
considered just like anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, regionally, you know,
in the winter we get our fruit and our
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetables from, you know, South America,
you know, all these types of regionalism
[SPEAKER_03]: that has, you know, built their industries
to accommodate the type of international
[SPEAKER_03]: food commerce and trade that is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually it will be available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, here in the United States,
you've got, you know, people like Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: and Mendocino that are trying to,
you know, start to label or constitute
[SPEAKER_03]: their label to protect themselves like
Champagne did for the Champagne region.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that anything that comes that
has the name Champagne has to be grown in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Champagne region.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, same thing that's marked
Humboldt has to be marked Humboldt and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't be outside of Humboldt and market
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are new challenges to,
you know, just small time regional
[SPEAKER_03]: realities that, Sam, come on, we're barely
here, much less at that international
[SPEAKER_03]: level where we could import, export.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't even get it to where we can't
even get it over state lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even county to county,
it's challenging here in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're considered this liberal bastion when
we're still just in the muck right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to those days too,
Sam, because I would love to be able to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, import Moroccan or Lebanese or,
you know, some of the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: exotic cannabis that, you know,
especially those genetics that are being
[SPEAKER_03]: found in Africa currently, you know,
there's a lot of stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: That has a lot to do with our peer
certification that we started.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you look at those industries
like the beer industry, I mean,
[SPEAKER_09]: Oregon was one of the first like big
micro-brew states to really promote
[SPEAKER_09]: micro-brewing and have micro-brews as a
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go into the stores in Oregon,
I mean, it's an explosion of micro-brews
[SPEAKER_09]: and some of them are really, really
successful and really amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So peer farmers and peer certified farmers
are making a difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have their own unique, you know,
soils and brands, their own, they tell
[SPEAKER_09]: their story.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's more of like a farm to table,
farm to seed, soil to table, soil to bowl,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's people showing why they're
not different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you go to those other countries,
it sounds really exotic when you're here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the minute you show up there,
you find out that all the banned
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: are there and who the hell knows what they
put in their soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: So honestly, I don't want to smoke that
stuff from that country because I know
[SPEAKER_09]: about paraquat and shit that's been
sprayed all over Mexico.
[SPEAKER_09]: And until we go there or someone else goes
there with some some like some values and
[SPEAKER_09]: morals and says, oh, yeah, no,
these people are totally growing of
[SPEAKER_09]: nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then now I can take that medicine and put
it into my body for my nine year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the reason why we, you know,
as you all are saying, we need to join
[SPEAKER_00]: together more on an international level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been in the in the black
market and all of these really large
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations are joining together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are talking to major companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are buying huge land shares of these,
you know, greenhouses of cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already been doing this for years
and set up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that it is imperative that
we all join together and that we do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: louder voice because our voice is the
culture of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to stay unique because that's
what they don't have is something unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you got to hope that people from all
different countries are being inspired by
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations like the ones that we're
having and that there's going to be people
[SPEAKER_05]: who do things on the highest level
possible in all of these different
[SPEAKER_05]: countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, just like everything,
there will be, you know, many people who
[SPEAKER_05]: don't do it with the highest of integrity.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the way the world works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I compare it to, you know, look at how
many people wear non organic cotton and
[SPEAKER_05]: eat non organic food and buy the cheapest
beers and wine and the cheapest cigarettes
[SPEAKER_05]: and the cheapest everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's money is a big sort of controlling
factor in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're kind of in a first world where
we get to sort of be self righteous,
[SPEAKER_05]: but where people are working their fingers
to the bones for pennies, it's a really
[SPEAKER_05]: big deal to, you know, be able to save
money where they can and buy things that
[SPEAKER_05]: are as inexpensive as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they want the highest caliber,
I'm certain, but some people it's just not
[SPEAKER_05]: an economic reality for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, too, the honest truth is that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, products are not grown organically
in California when they tested it,
[SPEAKER_11]: 60% of it had contamination from
pesticides and fungicides.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Jesus pointing at the foreign
companies who may or may not be more
[SPEAKER_11]: guilty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we clean up our own act first?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been a challenge and one that has
been, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we started testing in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we, you know, we had to
reinvent the wheel so that we could know
[SPEAKER_03]: what's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, it is still frustrating when,
you know, we test everything and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything was on my floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope to set those types of examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: To do things right, but it has also shown
us over the last 19 years now how many
[SPEAKER_03]: people won't do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that also shows that we have to be the
stewards.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to foster the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to be the integrity leaders that
show people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you're just tossed in with the
mess of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not setting the example that needs
to be set, and it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to do it right,
you have to do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's well worth doing it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't want somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something to affect somebody to kill
somebody, you know, somebody's son or
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter because of, you know,
a pesticide that wasn't screened for gets
[SPEAKER_03]: through and becomes a toxic shock to their
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next thing you know, I've got another
death on my hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got enough of that from war.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need any of that further.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how many people have our type of
integrity?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people like you, Sam,
went out there when you realized that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis wasn't there, that you actually
went out there and hunted down those
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics and then created the genetics
that we all share and enjoy today?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we need more people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also tried to help people have an
alternative with my pest and disease book
[SPEAKER_11]: to try to show people you don't have to
use poisons.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a higher road.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an amazing book, by the way,
for anyone that hasn't checked it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is definitely some you want to take a
course in cannabis, pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: That book is the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it's education as well,
because, you know, we had a problem at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Colladrius Network with people who were
trying to grow clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we started making the extracts,
we were seeing Michael butanol pop up and
[SPEAKER_02]: other things that was finally tracked down
the systemic pesticide issues from
[SPEAKER_02]: nurseries that they assumed were OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I think still I think we're
seeing a higher failure rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to destroy 40 percent of what was
donated to us because of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, showing up in contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the people who did that or
donated those things were people who were
[SPEAKER_02]: great in spirit and doing everything
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had to track it back to where it
was coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's the general industry as a
whole, I think, is they're understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: better how some of these work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see really more
separation from people with good
[SPEAKER_02]: intentions, but are still just have this
systemic problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who just don't care and are
still praying, spraying equal money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is exactly what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can't trust the USDA or the
federal government of any countries to
[SPEAKER_09]: tell you that what you're using is safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to go beyond that and trust your
gut and know what's happening in nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally trust your gut.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything that's happening on on farms
that we work with and and other people,
[SPEAKER_09]: they have to test every single thing that
comes on their property because the whole
[SPEAKER_09]: point of cannabis is that it pulls what's
in the soil up into the plant and and also
[SPEAKER_09]: and also with rooms with with clones and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Myclobutanol is almost like a radiating
element.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have a room not even used and then
have and then have people come back in and
[SPEAKER_09]: use it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's still problems with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to be smarter than the system.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to be able to to go beyond.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_09]: And and Eric's talking about the cut
flower things in Santa Barbara and central
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be really, really,
really difficult to grow a really clean
[SPEAKER_09]: product no matter who you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole environment is really,
really taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say it's taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to assume if we're going to be
taking over large land shares,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in other countries or in
California, that those land shares and
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil is taxed out and remediation has
to take, you know, immediate precedence
[SPEAKER_00]: before anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you go and you buy a piece
of land in order to be integral,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing that you're thinking is
how am I going to remediate?
[SPEAKER_09]: And soils don't just remediate over one
cycle of composting or what it takes like
[SPEAKER_09]: a year, two years, you know, three years
of big work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why Humboldt Mendocino in
California or around Chico or even Grass
[SPEAKER_09]: Valley are really important for cannabis
growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you think, Eric?
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been dumped on, though,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, surprisingly enough, all my
travels, I'm starting to meet a lot of old
[SPEAKER_10]: breeders or people, not old breeders,
but people that have been around a long
[SPEAKER_10]: time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We would consider the pioneers in the
industry and unfortunately, a good portion
[SPEAKER_10]: of everybody I've met didn't know Eagle 20
was bad back in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's been used and it's in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, roundup when they when
they talk about the percentages of kids
[SPEAKER_10]: that when they take a pee and they test
their pee for roundup, it's it's in
[SPEAKER_10]: everything, basically, they're saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when I did the moderating at the
Emerald Cup for the panel on the
[SPEAKER_10]: pesticides, you know, one of the things
the labs in the Department of Pesticide
[SPEAKER_10]: Regulation said is what is the metric for
clean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because really, everything's contaminated.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how do we find zero for cleanliness and
go from there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because everything ultimately is
contaminated to a certain level.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, it might seem kind of scary in
saying that, which, you know, in reality
[SPEAKER_10]: it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the end of the day, what's
happening right now is the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry forced its own people out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so now we have a whole new generation
of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't get me wrong, there's a lot of
pioneers involved.
[SPEAKER_10]: But a lot of those pioneers are big names
for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_10]: They weren't necessarily big growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were big companies for one reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it was a type of a genetic.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a type of an extract or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they weren't technically big,
large, but they get investors to throw
[SPEAKER_10]: this big lump of money, find a place in
Salinas to Santa Barbara, and they want to
[SPEAKER_10]: set up shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then everybody grabs their darts and
starts throwing the darts at the
[SPEAKER_10]: dartboard, basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I saw in Santa Barbara and some
of these places is, you know, if we are
[SPEAKER_10]: going to move into some of those old
wooden greenhouses, the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_10]: megastructures of these big cut flower
farms are still operating their farms,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they've scaled down to barely one
greenhouse, let's say, on their mega farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what they do is they lease out the
biggest pieces of shit left on the farm to
[SPEAKER_10]: the cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the cannabis growers go to these
old wooden shitters basically and have to
[SPEAKER_10]: fix them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Santa Barbara County won't let you
build a new greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to fix up what's already there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so then people go in and spend a ton
of money trying to fix up a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they go broke before they even get a
plant in the ground.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the second person comes along and
leases that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they continue working on it and
put a ton of money into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They go under.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the third person gets to move in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the third person's actually stoked
because the third person, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: has all this shit done that the first two
people ran out of money trying to
[SPEAKER_10]: accomplish.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, it's really funny to see how
much money is going into everything,
[SPEAKER_10]: to the people throwing darts and the big
names that really might not be the people
[SPEAKER_10]: to scale up, but the investors want to run
on the big name.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't necessarily know that the
clean, beautiful flowers, what's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: make the win, but, you know, rather cling
to the big names.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then all the other people that
couldn't get permits, all the people that
[SPEAKER_10]: know what they're doing, that's been
educated are pioneering, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: family members, so to speak, are left
without permits and kind of in the dust.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now who are they?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think the soil is a big part of
it, like Dragonfly Earth Medicine crew was
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioning there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think on the other side,
if you look at the majority of plants
[SPEAKER_05]: produced clonally, micropropagation and
tissue culture is an answer to being able
[SPEAKER_05]: to clean out pathogens and fungi and
microbials from plants that have been
[SPEAKER_05]: impregnated over generations with just
incredible amounts of systemic problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, including things like
microbutanol and all these horrible Eagle
[SPEAKER_05]: 20s and just ridiculous pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a way, you know,
if we start looking at that to start sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of cleaning up and renewing vigor on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to be working for many other
different clonally produced plants around
[SPEAKER_05]: the globe.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And our testing is leveling up as we go
with legalization.
[SPEAKER_10]: So technically right now there's medical
mixed in with recreational You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of the rollout California had anyway
isn't going as expected as far as how to
[SPEAKER_10]: deal with the medical and the recreational
that's left over from last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think there's just a lot of gray
areas and yeah, there are solutions and I
[SPEAKER_10]: agree with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are answers and we can get to where
we need to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately with this California the
way it is, I guess you should say we're
[SPEAKER_10]: going to go through, we're going to be
going through some shit for a couple of
[SPEAKER_10]: years, I think, in order to get this
organized.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it really makes no sense at all
because microbutanol in small percentages
[SPEAKER_09]: can be used on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's everywhere in St. Louis that have had
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Strawberry growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, in Salinas area,
there's strawberries everywhere and
[SPEAKER_10]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, in Mendocino and other
places, there's tons of grapes and wine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you go to Santa Barbara,
there's tons of avocados.
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the greenhouse facilities I was
at was, you know, amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: A major greenhouse facility with five
different farms or four at least on the
[SPEAKER_10]: same property.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the neighbor next door was about to
spray with the helicopter avid on his
[SPEAKER_10]: avocados because that's what they do once
a year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, over here you got the orchid
grower with their exhaust fans blowing out
[SPEAKER_10]: this way towards the cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: The neighbor that literally has his
branches of trees hanging over the fence
[SPEAKER_10]: going, I'm about to spray avid on my
avocados.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do it once a year and everybody's trying
to do these sealed greenhouses sucking in
[SPEAKER_10]: all this air and blowing it all out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't say that passive would solve
the problem either in some of those
[SPEAKER_10]: situations.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, everybody's kind of in fear,
you know, if you're not, if you don't have
[SPEAKER_10]: a permit and you're about to jump off,
you know, you got these people that are
[SPEAKER_10]: permitted and they don't, you know,
it's like, it's just a whole coming
[SPEAKER_10]: unglued situation right now and how to
sort it all out with the speed of
[SPEAKER_10]: lightning that needs to get done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because investors want to see returns now
and they want to see the money coming back
[SPEAKER_10]: and everybody, like I said, with their
dart throwing capabilities of,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, resorted to two gallon pots or
one gallon pots, you know, kind of see a
[SPEAKER_10]: green and maybe it's going to be organic
or not, but we all know that it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be living soil or, you know,
no till or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, the organic words definitely
like you guys know, Kelly and Josh,
[SPEAKER_10]: the word organic is watered down and,
you know, organic produce from other
[SPEAKER_10]: countries isn't organic, even though it
says it is, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, you know, what's the level of
cleanliness that we can go by,
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you could say, and it might just
have to go for where you are and your farm
[SPEAKER_10]: and your personal situation in order to do
that because the conglomerates are going
[SPEAKER_10]: to have a tough time.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why it's all extracts anyway,
but as Forrest was saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of the extracts get thrown out and I
heard some people up north are taking the
[SPEAKER_10]: approach like the chemical company,
dilution is the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this isn't even a
conversation about glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's a conversation that
nobody's even having.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to test, you know, all of our
inputs, you know, for our products and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like a really long list of herbs
and we go to areas all over and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: find small farmers and then we're testing
their glyphosate levels and even though,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that's outside of the realm
because, you know, the USDA feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate can be put in a baby bottle and
babies can drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see it as something that's
totally toxic, but we know over prolonged
[SPEAKER_00]: use that it kills soil microbiology and if
we're killing soil microbiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're killing all of the microbes
inside of our gut and then that just takes
[SPEAKER_00]: away our intelligence and I feel like,
you know, the glyphosate conversation is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that hasn't even been talked
about because it's not something that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're testing for in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not testing for it in,
you know, all of our organic fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't really realize that they didn't
test for molds in Oregon or was it
[SPEAKER_10]: Washington or Oregon?
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't really, I saw, I was reading some
stuff and there was somebody that opened
[SPEAKER_10]: up a bud out of a dispensary and it was
covered in mold and I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's not something they test for up there,
is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're not testing for any kind of
molds or fungi at this point right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can't differentiate the DNA
between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, whatever counts like say
lactic acid bacteria, there's 36 or even
[SPEAKER_00]: more different types of species of lactic
acid that floats around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it lands on your flower, it's really
only a beneficial to us, but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come up as a negative on the
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't differentiate the DNA species,
so they've done away with it and actually
[SPEAKER_11]: that's not true.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can, but they're not doing it,
is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very expensive test.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not doing it, but they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they definitely can and they aren't
doing it, I think, because of the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: that test and maybe you have something to
say about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin McKernan is going to come in later
on today as well, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'll let him deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he said he should be popping in a
little bit here, so hopefully he'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to pick that up when he comes in and
ask him about that because that's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely very, very important that
they're testing for these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's just the level of cleanliness
depends on, you know, the farmers and the
[SPEAKER_10]: testing labs to kind of do the due
diligence and, you know, from what you
[SPEAKER_10]: hear from a lot of flower people or
farmers that, you know, testing labs
[SPEAKER_10]: aren't always the same from one to another
and that can be kind of confusing as well
[SPEAKER_10]: for people to, you know, make their path
forward if one lab saying one thing and
[SPEAKER_10]: another lab saying another, whether it's
pass or fail or percentages or these
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes, you know, people are trying to
use the labs also to brand their products
[SPEAKER_10]: with, you know, what they do include in
them, you know, what's included is really
[SPEAKER_10]: important from the lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, we find out a lot of
things that, you know, look at that.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is an easy solution for that,
which is they all have to use the same
[SPEAKER_11]: testing protocol and it gets checked by an
independent agency.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter which state or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a proper protocol and that should
be used.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need that in California in the sense
there needs to be some sort of a
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratory regulation industry,
which is, of course, now the BCC is
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed, but they've dragged their feet
just getting us certified with just these
[SPEAKER_03]: emergency regulations, which we have to
then get recertified every three months
[SPEAKER_03]: until the permanent regs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we're trying to get there,
Sam, which is time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the challenge is like we need
regulation, but we're being regulated to
[SPEAKER_02]: death, you know, and, you know,
as cannabis and Wade could probably talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about maybe some of what he's doing,
but getting in with the Ag Commissions
[SPEAKER_02]: locally and some of the farmers,
you know, when you speak with them,
[SPEAKER_02]: they say, you know, one of the fears they
have is looking at cannabis as an Ag
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small farmers are dying because they are
overregulated already and then cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: adds this whole other level to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's just kind of has other
industries looking going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can do it to them, they can do it
to us too, you know, which is why I think
[SPEAKER_02]: getting involved in the Ag Committees and
Commissions at the local level and beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: is really important for cannabis work in
the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more people that test,
the prices will come down because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing people writing, you know,
the testing prices are high.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn right they're high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have seen what it cost me when
I was pioneering this 11 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't want to see the expense,
but it is one of those necessary evils I
[SPEAKER_03]: had to swallow and deal with so that we
could arrive at a point where we actually
[SPEAKER_03]: had, you know, ring testing and satellite
testing so that we could verify that these
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratories were actually doing what,
you know, Sam was saying, actually showing
[SPEAKER_03]: proper protocol or, you know, the big
frustration I had was then people tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: make their testing a proprietary situation
so that we couldn't even see what the
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking testing was.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's been a fight all the way
through and one that has to be fought all
[SPEAKER_03]: the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ed Chen, at least you had a choice of lab
or labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I started, there were no labs,
zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the same thing I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had zero labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to bring people from around the
world and create that first lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with that lab is spread to others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the same boat as you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to reinvent the wheel because the
research triangle wouldn't give us
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to buy the GC by the HPLC and,
uh, build a laboratory and hire a
[SPEAKER_11]: scientist just for in-house use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what you're like on the next
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You took the bullet so that all I had to
do is deal with people who already had the
[SPEAKER_03]: machines, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect that I didn't have to spend the
quarter million dollars or three quarters
[SPEAKER_03]: of a million dollars on the type of
machinery that is really required to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's for real folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what those machines cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was 10 years ago, which means it
costs even more today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to add that the photo I was
holding up while we were talking,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a macro photograph of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those of you that have never seen
powdery mildew ups up close, it looks like
[SPEAKER_05]: little, little, little bug bodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just stack on top of one another and
they create these long sort of strings and
[SPEAKER_05]: you can see the size of them versus the
size of the glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're quite thin and quite small,
but they get everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wrap themselves around the resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no escaping it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a bad scene.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the photograph, does it penetrate
the resin or can they be separated?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen it penetrate the resin,
Sam, but how is that for timing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin McKernan's in the room and we're
talking about microbials and being able to
[SPEAKER_05]: test to decipher the difference between.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're showing a macro photograph of
powdery mildew right now from my Instagram
[SPEAKER_05]: account.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send it to you if you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mycelium, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: First one in 140 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you grew a beard, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not getting kicked off YouTube
like everyone else, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the church in the name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just been really not rocking the
boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't made any videos talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people making videos to talk
about it and getting their channels
[SPEAKER_05]: deleted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just praying that we make it
through, you know, just this more than
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: My channel is great and fun, but really
this particular show with all of you
[SPEAKER_05]: people being able to come in once every
Sunday to me is the most valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll do anything to protect it.
[SPEAKER_04]: D2, there's a decentralized version of
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's now sitting on the IPFS.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like uncensored.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a good keep your videos in case
they, you know, they try and come back in
[SPEAKER_05]: the mall up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome D420K to the room,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's 400 people in the room waiting
for you to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bon rep, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's fucking do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the book house of harlequin or
house of laughter, hemp diseases and pests
[SPEAKER_05]: management and biological control.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the book you want to look up yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: J.M.
[SPEAKER_05]: McPartland, R.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clark and D.P.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Serious, serious book right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a heavy book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an expensive book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but it's it's one word supporting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you look at the cost of the
knowledge and the knowledge that's in it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is priceless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is well worth any expense that's there
if you want to do things naturally and
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Rob Clark, for showing us
how to fucking do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get asked all the time, like,
hey, what are you reading and what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: book?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, well, it's two hundred and
sixty dollars and it comes out of this
[SPEAKER_02]: university.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't want to spend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you really want to
learn, those are the books with the
[SPEAKER_02]: information or they're not cheap.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Johnny McPartland, John McPartland
contributed to that book, probably as much
[SPEAKER_11]: or more than me and Rob.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob took the pictures.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the hands on practical knowledge and
John had his nose buried in libraries and
[SPEAKER_11]: research things to find all the
information that I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Rob didn't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: But together, the three of us were an
unbeatable team.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did any macro photos end up in that book?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't I don't remember, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a copy with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I can't remember either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I sent some for some reason,
but I can't keep up with which ones get in
[SPEAKER_05]: and which ones don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a great book, regardless of any
macro photographs, the information that it
[SPEAKER_05]: is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a resource that you just if
you're growing cannabis and you're dealing
[SPEAKER_05]: with pests and diseases, which you are,
if you're growing cannabis, you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to want to have this information in your
library.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only in hardback, as far as I
know, right, Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen it in soft back.
[SPEAKER_11]: No paperback.
[SPEAKER_03]: You almost need to come out with a ringed
copy so that you could easily turn the
[SPEAKER_03]: pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in case you come up with another one
there, Sam, in the future reference book
[SPEAKER_11]: than a a growers hands on manual in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, we thought about it,
but we just didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to speak about the testing thing
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to step out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other night I heard I was in a
conversation with a fellow who was one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the pioneers in the organic food movement
who lives here in our area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had many things to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things he pointed out is
that there are more than a thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: chemical compounds that are certified for
use on food products in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of them have to do with
controlling pests or diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: And meantime, how will we ever ask our
labs to be able to test for that many
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to suggest that Dragonfly
Earth, you guys have nailed down to me the
[SPEAKER_06]: real concept about how to do this,
which is to know your sources,
[SPEAKER_06]: know all the inputs to your garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over time, you can remediate your soil and
the environment you're in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by making your own inputs,
you have a fair sense of knowing that your
[SPEAKER_06]: product, the material you're producing,
will in fact be free of contaminants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's a matter of building a
backstory behind you and your work and
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're producing that makes it worth
it in the agricultural market,
[SPEAKER_06]: because if tomatoes is a good example.
[SPEAKER_06]: In California, there are people who grow
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get paid 14 cents a pound for their
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they're selling it in 40,000
pound trucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other people who get paid $4 a
pound for their tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I suggest that cannabis has a much
wider discretionary marketplace,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you will, for what we call top shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you start talking about medical
need, for me, it's really about the
[SPEAKER_06]: producers have to know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why that book is so important to
me, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that you know, when you offer some oil
to one of these families, you know that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's going to be free of contaminants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's been to the lab and it's
tested for what's there, they're only
[SPEAKER_06]: testing for 20 some different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can test for 39 currently, but out of
the thousand and some certified in
[SPEAKER_06]: California.
[SPEAKER_06]: For you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, 10 years ago, we had zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so that shows you the length and time
that science takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kevin can speak to it very,
very precisely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, science can't be rushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be replicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be done properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so each year we're able to add and add
other pesticides as we get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the laboratories can quantify or
they can get the actual standards to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually quantify.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's then added to the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we have 40 that we can test for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it shows you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that should give you and everybody an
idea of the drop in the water we're still
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're supposedly doing it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be interested in exploring the world
of microbials, too, as far as testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, you want to have the
alternative to the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you may be talking about,
you know, microbial growth and biological
[SPEAKER_09]: growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: From soils and also potentially your
foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if maybe, Kevin, you can you can weigh
in on this, you know, is it hard to tell
[SPEAKER_09]: the difference between probiotic
microbials and pathogenic microbial or
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma and botrytis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kyle Boyer just did a great webinar on
this with the CAN group last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try and forward that link around on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, trichoderma is key for
getting rid of aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the problem we have is that,
well, it's really not in California
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: California put regs down that are very
species specific so that you're not
[SPEAKER_04]: getting penalized for using beneficial
microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in many states that are still
following the AHP, they have language in
[SPEAKER_04]: there that looks like it forces you to use
petri films, which can't discern the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: They try to count things in colony forming
units.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you really can't discern
trichoderma from aspergillus from these
[SPEAKER_04]: other harmful ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing that we ran into very
recently, we were doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: sequencing with Digipath Labs in Nevada,
trying to figure out when molecular
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques differ from, yeah, from from
the actual plating that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we were finding is there's a lot
of Ralstonia that shows up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ralstonia is a bacteria that lives
inside of a fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an endofungal bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you try and plate this,
you don't you might get a mold colony.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have a thousand of these
pathogenic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you won't be counting those when you
start counting colonies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this thing also makes what's known
as a rhizotoxin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's both a human pathogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It causes plant wilt and it also makes a
mycotoxin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a pretty nasty thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sometimes evades a lot of the
culturing techniques because it likes to
[SPEAKER_04]: hang out inside of other fungi.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kevin, is the bacterium itself damaging to
humans?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's something there's something
called it has a disease name that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: Ralstonitis or something where Ralstonia
gets into their lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it can be infected.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some cases of of illness from
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that anything's been tied to
cannabis derived illness, but they have
[SPEAKER_04]: seen it in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's usually with cystic fibrosis
patients or cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it can have some human health and it
can form.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can make the plants have some wilt as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we probably got to pick that one up and
make sure that we can discern it from from
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does infect aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a there's a list of like 20
different fungi that it does infect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it infects them, it makes them
clump and form these chlamydia spores,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is one of these survival modes that
the fungi go into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that alone can make them really
difficult to quantitate, because once the
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi start to clump and you put them on
plates, you can't tell one colony from a
[SPEAKER_04]: thousand there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a big snot that lands on
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's really key for the whole
pesticide things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not very well versed on all the
pesticide limits that have been put in
[SPEAKER_04]: place yet in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do know people were debating on the
parts per million and the parts per
[SPEAKER_04]: billion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing we do see is a lot of
fungicide use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're worried that people are being
driven to use fungicides because these
[SPEAKER_04]: plating systems often give you false
positives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And tell you that you have fungus when you
don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of bacteria that grow on
these plates, and you can't really discern
[SPEAKER_04]: them from the fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, if you're using bacillus and
trichoderma, those could end up giving you
[SPEAKER_04]: false positives on these culturing
systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would signal to growers,
hey, you should use more fungicides
[SPEAKER_04]: because you've got a fungus problem when
you really have just a bacillus problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bacillus is actually probably your
best thing to fight against it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the trichoderma, are they actually
using that in the soil or on the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how folks are using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming it comes up from the roots
because I think it's meant to be helpful
[SPEAKER_04]: for nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was my next question.
[SPEAKER_11]: How does it get on the plant if it's only
applied in the soil?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we used it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of these things, when they get
into the roots, they actually vascularize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fusarium gets into the roots and
vascularizes all through the xylem and
[SPEAKER_04]: phloem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've actually been doing biopsy works
throughout the plants to figure out,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, can we pick it up in the leaves
or do we have to do core preps?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you take a whole punch out of the
stem to see if you can pick it up from
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does seem to be following what you
guys were writing about in that book,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is it comes in through the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do stem preps, you can pick up
fusarium, much more of it than you can if
[SPEAKER_04]: you try and sample it out of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think bacillus, though, to your point,
Sam, is that they tend to spray that one
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more like a foliar spray for a lot
of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that, like, in products called
Serenade.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that you'll find in the
garden stores, which is a bacillus that
[SPEAKER_04]: you spray on plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, they can be in different places
and sometimes they're vascularized and
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a few cancer patients die in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was last year, I believe, from fungal
infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that aspergillus, do you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was two of them, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were concerned about aspergillus,
mucor, and there's a couple other in that
[SPEAKER_04]: paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Thompson is the one who published
that paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try and see if I can get that thing
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we wanted to test for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not only pesticides and
herbicides, but also for fungus,
[SPEAKER_03]: because remember back in 2006,
when I got an upper respiratory infection,
[SPEAKER_03]: we used all our organic leptic testing to,
you know, from our visual standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still got sick, which means there
was something microbial there that we
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why, you know, and one of the
reasons why it took so long is because it
[SPEAKER_03]: takes 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a plate test, people, that means it
has to, they have to take it, they have to
[SPEAKER_03]: put it on a plate and it's got to sit
there for 72 hours incubating so then it
[SPEAKER_03]: can pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to have a quick 24-hour test.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's not how Kevin does it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kevin does it el cuico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just giving a layman's term for
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're using DNA to try and find
those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was another one in Bakersfield
actually that just came out this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an outbreak for cryptococcal
meningitis in a Bakersfield dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: The patient didn't die, but the patient
got hospitalized with a lung infection
[SPEAKER_04]: that eventually ended up getting to her
brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's one that we probably have to
add to the list because it has been seen
[SPEAKER_04]: in a lot of HIV patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one that is not currently being
tested for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they took nine more samples with
dispensary and found that almost all of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was a patient who was going in
and buying the cheapest blunts that they
[SPEAKER_04]: should, like the pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were more or less, that was their
habit is it always went there probably
[SPEAKER_04]: three joints a day and they're constantly
getting kind of the bottom of the barrel
[SPEAKER_04]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, note to self.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other thing is, is I think
that we're going to be seeing way more
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal infections and way more bacterial
infections of pathogens on both humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing it in soils, you know,
excuse me, the more and more soil tests
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're that we're getting back,
you know, from all of these farms all over
[SPEAKER_00]: is the aluminum rates are going through
the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iron rates are going through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: These heavy metals that we're dealing with
are so vast and all of the vital toxins
[SPEAKER_00]: and chemicals that are happening are
killing our microbiome, not only in our
[SPEAKER_00]: own body, but also on plant life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the in the ecosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's really important that
while we're still looking at and defining
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different pathogens,
we need to also be looking at beneficials
[SPEAKER_00]: and defining beneficials and how they can
be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think that no matter what
kind of science that we can throw at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important thing is that nature is
going to take care of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she has over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that, you know, that's the
real solution and answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there an Al Quico way to do the DNA
testing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that seems to be the most
effective way to discern between
[SPEAKER_09]: pathogenic and non pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with bacillus itself, I mean,
there's a thousand different, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's just a number I'm throwing up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many different strains of bacillus.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that bacillus is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that bacillus is good in our
intestines and lower intestines.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have bacillus in our natural mystic
sprays.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we find it really beneficial,
but it can turn out to be a positive.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in general, I avoided using sprays
because of the false positives that were
[SPEAKER_11]: coming up for beneficials.
[SPEAKER_11]: The last thing I was using was BTI against
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_11]: And luckily I was only breeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't producing medicine for people,
but I wondered was BTI, would it pass the
[SPEAKER_11]: testing that is being done in the various
states now?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: As BTI, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bacillus thermo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that one would probably trigger a
total aerobic count.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't trigger anything in California
because California right now just has
[SPEAKER_04]: coli, seminilla, and four aspergillus
species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those we can do in a very targeted
manner.
[SPEAKER_04]: We target right down to the species level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been cases of aspergillus
failures that are disputed in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a dispute up there between I think
one lab was calling it Braziliensis when
[SPEAKER_04]: it was really aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually aspergillus Braziliensis,
but they failed at thinking it was
[SPEAKER_04]: aspergillus niger because they couldn't
speciate it on a film.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lab that was using DNA techniques
could actually differentiate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get very, very specific with
the DNA test.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hard thing to do with the DNA test is
to go after these categories like total
[SPEAKER_04]: aerobic counts and total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a way to do that, but it's very
hard to get it to be concordant with the
[SPEAKER_04]: platings because the platings don't
necessarily select.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mold plates can grow bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it makes it really hard if you get
a test that comes out with identical CFUs
[SPEAKER_04]: per gram as a plate because the plates
have so many pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, 99% of microbes don't culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know how to culture them yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're missing the vast majority of the
microbiome when we start using those
[SPEAKER_04]: culture systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have made tests that try to address
the AHP.
[SPEAKER_04]: The AHP has these guidelines that are
written in total aerobic counts and total
[SPEAKER_04]: yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those ones are very, very vague
categories that we think actually do more
harm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent conversation, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, really enjoying the in-depth
conversation on testing and bacteria and
[SPEAKER_05]: just the health of cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is definitely a phytoremediative plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can pull things up out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say quickly,
you know, some of the things that were
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up by Dragonfly folks here is,
you know, I think the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we learn more about it, will hopefully
expect higher expectations out of what
[SPEAKER_02]: they purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's hard when people are if they
want cheap, if they want low quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that risk is going to come along with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we understand more about the gut
and the microbiome, how that is so closely
[SPEAKER_02]: intertwined with neurological function,
and we're learning more about the gut and
[SPEAKER_02]: the brain and how it's tied together,
we can start to realize that if we,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if we're using cannabis to
treat something medicinally, that these
[SPEAKER_02]: things aren't, you know, something that
you can separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be able to know that what
you're doing to the things that affect
[SPEAKER_02]: your gut and your body are going to also
impact whatever neurological thing you
[SPEAKER_02]: might be treating, whether it be,
you know, a bipolar or schizophrenic or
[SPEAKER_02]: mental health conditions, chronic
migraine, heaven forbid, seizure
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders, you name them.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things, all these points are
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if people are more educated as
consumers, hopefully that expectation is
[SPEAKER_02]: translated into the behavior of the people
who are trying to get their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, becoming more educated
on better health and well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that, you know, healthy soil
does have all of the answers to a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: mind and body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has all of the components
that it needs to be able to grow something
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy in the same way that we can easily
look at soil and be able to mimic that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bio structure that's happening
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that the more that we look
towards nature and the more that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: an understanding of what health really
looks like because it's been so diminished
[SPEAKER_00]: over such a long period of time,
then we really can gain that intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that we can't even separate our
intelligence from the beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome that's going on within
ourselves as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a lot of work coming on now
showing that your gut flora have a big
[SPEAKER_04]: impact on things like Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's and all these chronic
[SPEAKER_04]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they start doing fecal transplants,
they see very, very striking results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the fecal implants have been really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that, you know, we're really
trying to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always go back and forth from health to
soil and plants to health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that, you know, what they're
doing with fecal implants is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing that we're doing with
remediation of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're adding a massive amount of
beneficial microbiology into a soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: remediate it, it's the same way that these
fecal implants are really gaining a great
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum because, you know, Department of
Agriculture hasn't really given those
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't looked beyond, you know,
necessarily the NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're just learning about
dissecting DNA of fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that, you know, once we're
starting to see it within human health,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to really start to understand
it even more because more money is put
[SPEAKER_00]: towards human health and understanding the
microbiome in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more work and research that we do
in that area, you know, the more that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to gain the intelligence that
we need to be able to overcome all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathogens that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there is a study out from CDC
recently in OSHA getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent and concerned over the cannabis
trimming environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to post it up right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they evaluated the health hazards that
trimmigrants might run into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the results of this,
which is that there's high exposure to,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, powdery mildew, which I think you
were just showing off some mycelium,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also to botrytis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know where that's going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a case here in Massachusetts
where one of the employees sued I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: remember which company it was,
but one of the growers here is getting
[SPEAKER_04]: sued by an employee because they broke out
in rashes in the trimming room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem we have here is some of
the testing labs are using culturing,
[SPEAKER_04]: which doesn't actually culture botrytis or
PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can't really see the problem and
help guide the dispensary or the grower on
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a bit of an issue here.
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the use of isopropyl alcohol
and its buildup on the liver and is there
[SPEAKER_09]: alternatives that people can use besides
isopropyl alcohol?
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume people will be using oils and
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Hazen Camp paper show in olive oil
were probably some of the best things for
[SPEAKER_04]: extracting and keeping all the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipid extraction is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I won't let any of our kids or the
families you work with get anywhere near
[SPEAKER_02]: isopropyl at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see some people doing it once in a
while, but you know, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: when, you know, RSO was first getting sort
of some attention and Naphtha was used all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time, you know, and it just started to
trickle to isopropyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the isopropyl is thankfully dying
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it very much, but...
[SPEAKER_05]: Naphtha, it has rust and lead inhibitor
that's put into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a greenish bluish tinge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you really have to run that through a
still and clean that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I obviously I'm not using many solvents at
all when I'm extracting, but definitely if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to, you should try to try to
get them as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to add in the middle of
this great conversation that I do have
[SPEAKER_05]: Hilary Black stopping by really briefly.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's doing an old woman's panel today at
Lyft, but she's going to stop in just for
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 or 20 minutes and tell us a little bit
about her recent conversation she had with
[SPEAKER_05]: the Senate here in Canada, in Ontario,
in Ottawa, our capital city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so she'll be here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, I won't want to be rude,
but when she gets here, wherever our
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation is, we're just going to
pause, let her say her piece, and then get
[SPEAKER_05]: to what she has to do because of course
she's very busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to add that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it should be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always and what about you,
Micah?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have anything to add today?
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been very quiet, but I see you
there sitting and listening and feeling
[SPEAKER_05]: intrigued.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, the conversation is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was having some computer issues there
for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I missed the front half of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But can you guys hear me all right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things, you know, Eric kind of
touched on a little bit and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that I've noticed a lot over the last
couple of years when it comes to testing
[SPEAKER_07]: and pesticide use and all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things, we've got this
distribution company we've been working on
[SPEAKER_07]: out of Mendocino and we're testing flour
and trend all, you know, all the time,
[SPEAKER_07]: hundreds of test results off of all these
different farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we thought that, you know,
as all these bigger farms came online down
[SPEAKER_07]: in Salinas and that, you know,
maybe it would be a good idea for us to
[SPEAKER_07]: get down in that area and start testing
some of that material.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we found is that most of that
material down there was dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not so much that the farms
themselves, they're not, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: their practices are good, but they've got
these neighbors that are down the road
[SPEAKER_07]: that are contaminating all of their
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it got to the point to where,
you know, I agree with what Eric was
[SPEAKER_07]: saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like there's something to be said for
these farms that are in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_07]: Mendocino, Grass Valley, these like more
out-of-the-way areas where it's easier to
[SPEAKER_07]: keep your product clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's rough having your neighbor
jump in the helicopter and spray a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: of metric gallons of Avid is just like,
my skin was crawling when he was saying
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, that's, that's heinous.
[SPEAKER_10]: In their greenhouses standing around when
the, I guess there was a shipment of the
[SPEAKER_10]: Avid showed up and it went to the growers
address and it was supposed to go to the
[SPEAKER_10]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so all these growers are standing
around going, whose pallet of Avid is
[SPEAKER_10]: this?
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody's like, not me, not me,
not me.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, sure enough, it went to the guy
next door with the helicopter,
[SPEAKER_10]: no less.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then everybody's panicked.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're suffering from Avid shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the concerns that we see in
some of the counties here in California is
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really trying to push it out of
the hills, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to get it more to the flat
agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't, it is some other,
you know, commodity that you can put next
[SPEAKER_02]: to those valley, you know, the central
Valley in California has been sprayed for
[SPEAKER_02]: decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's like we've said,
there's no clean place just with the wind
[SPEAKER_02]: alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this whole push to get it sort of out
of the hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons that the cannabis is so
clean, just like we just said here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada County, up in Humboldt,
Mendocino is that there isn't that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: other agricultural farmland that has just
has a culture of just spraying whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's been, it's been nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that people who are in those
counties, when they start to hear that
[SPEAKER_02]: push, understand how that push to kind of
uproot the culture of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hills of Northern California is also going
to equal to a really difficult time
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing and finding the quality of
cannabis and clean cannabis you need,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's going to take years to clean
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these places before I would touch
what's being grown there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you've got places like Calaveras
County that open up their doors and then
[SPEAKER_03]: shut their doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where, where do these people go?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're literally through prohibition of
local, you know, locality is forcing these
[SPEAKER_03]: people into going into central Valley,
into going into the regular agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: areas because of the, you know,
the fear of prohibition or whatever the
[SPEAKER_03]: hell happened in Calaveras County,
which, you know, it should be a wake up
[SPEAKER_03]: call and a realistic focusing of
everybody, no matter what fucking county
[SPEAKER_03]: you in, you need to stay on top of what's
actually going on and stay in tune and
[SPEAKER_03]: plug yourself in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you, if, you know,
I hear people say, you know, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm so tired of, you know,
I don't really think about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, voting and doing things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what, you know,
you may not think politics involves you,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, your boss is involved in
politics, your landlord is involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: politics, your insurance company,
you're involved in politics and all
[SPEAKER_03]: they're doing is using their political
will to make their lives much more
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't think that you have any
reason to be involved, you better check
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself because all kinds of people
wasted hundreds of thousands, if not
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of dollars investing in Calaveras
County only have their door shut on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the county said, fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think people realize how much
influence they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they, you know, I think there's this
apathy that we just can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is work though, you know,
we were in Nevada County, we were an all
[SPEAKER_02]: out ban.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were put it on the measure just
specifically to make it so that the future
[SPEAKER_02]: board of supervisors couldn't change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how much of a ban they wanted to
implement here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, with a lot of activism and
a lot of work, we were able to defeat it
[SPEAKER_02]: and can, and didn't stop from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're at a point where,
you know, we are having ordinances coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be issuing commercial
licenses, you know, from, from the place
[SPEAKER_02]: with plaster County and all around the
Sierra County where everywhere is in a
[SPEAKER_02]: ban.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but it went from work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would absolutely just be in a ban if we
sat at home and said, Hey, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same on the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started applying that at the state
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in the BCC, we haven't
gotten into this too much, but we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at, and helping develop new
license types.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking to actually shape what
cannabis is going to look like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that's, you know,
what cannabis looks like now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our communities is not what it should
have, or would look like if we hadn't had
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have now is just like,
you know, I like to equate it to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this beautiful, you know, girl who,
or child that was locked in a basement for
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of opened the door and let her
out and she comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, ah, I can't see it's bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think that that's, we're just going
to make that legal now and continue to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we are at a point now where we
can absolutely shape how cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated into our lives and into our
lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we absolutely do have influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been actually pretty shocked about
how much progress we've been able to make
[SPEAKER_02]: just making time to go to Sacramento,
to speak with lawmakers, to go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, are we going to complain about
the way things are, or are we going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the generation that shapes the way it is
in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I know what side I've
picked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful segue into what Hillary
is here to talk to us about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to welcome Hillary black into
the first hash church after 140 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to tell us a little bit about
you, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was thinking about, um, this
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we had an opportunity to speak to the
Senate last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our legalization bill is being reviewed
by the Senate in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of movement around,
um, pushing back on some really key
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the senators wanted to repeal the
home grow aspect of the bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had been talking a lot about
putting a potency caps in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even talking about like limiting the
potency of flowers that were allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute, not even yet really wrapping
their head around, um, resins and other
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were many, many things that I
wanted to speak to them about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you only get seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to like hone it all
down into seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two things that I focused on was a
tax and potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the tax side, our government already
charges a sales tax to medical patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're applying an excise tax
act, which is basically a sin tax to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're proposing to put it on
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was sort of a really big thing
that we're fighting back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause so many patients, as you guys know,
can't afford the amount of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: they need already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should not be putting a sin tax on
a medicine for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the potency conversation was also
really interesting because you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that these senators are kind of
in like kindergarten around their cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really easy to be angry and
frustrated that they don't get certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things or be patient and try to meet them
where they are in terms of their level of
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I think is
always interesting to talk about around
[SPEAKER_01]: potency that so many people don't know,
it's like my favorite fun fact these days
[SPEAKER_01]: is around how we have very few cannabinoid
receptors in our brainstem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our brainstem is responsible for
cardiac and respiratory function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why unlike opiates and alcohol,
cannabis can't actually kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talked to them about how using the
word overdose with cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_01]: actually appropriate because the word
overdose insinuates that death is
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they had had like a lot of the
people that came to testify, it was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like get in your time machine and go
back to 1962 level of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibitionist rhetoric that they were
hearing from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They even had a visit from Sam,
the like America's like super
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative, doesn't even really get any
traction anywhere in America,
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibitionists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a couple of our conservative
senators actually went down and spent the
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon with Jeff Sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this kind of influence on our process
is infuriating to say the least,
[SPEAKER_01]: but so we had a lot of work to do to
address some of the misinformation that
[SPEAKER_01]: they had received.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, I was going to tell you talking
about potency and extracts, talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: the brainstem and also just, you know,
explaining the super basics that you all
[SPEAKER_01]: know that if you're using like the
trichromes by themselves, it can just mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that you consume less plant matter and
what that means for patients and talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the difference between like smoking
a whole joint or if you want to like
[SPEAKER_01]: having one inhalation off like an elegant
vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that we really got the
messages across around potency and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that what they are wanting to achieve
through potency limits, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work that they need to just regulate all
of the products, all the potencies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we can deal with them in a
responsible way in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of felt like I had my like
hash church flag with me when I was out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to hop in and say hi,
I'm glad that you're back on the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, we were just going on about it
for the first half an hour, how great it
[SPEAKER_05]: is to see all the familiar happy faces and
here in D420K, say bong rip was like the
[SPEAKER_05]: opening bell for church.
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched your, what you were talking
about and everything there and you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: touched on levels of being close in age,
like the under 17 and getting the criminal
[SPEAKER_08]: record and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys did an incredible job.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys look so professional up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would pull them all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you guys did a good job.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was it was pretty amazing to see
like team legalization, get our chance up
[SPEAKER_01]: at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got the last word because they
start doing the line by line through the
[SPEAKER_01]: act and proposing their amendments next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of those panels from that day are
super worth watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Q&A is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not that anybody here is really
interested in like Canada's politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you happen to be somebody who is
vaguely interested in that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Q&A is super interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I want us to get it right,
you know, and the way that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing cannabis is really still with a
prohibitionist mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they had to sell it to the
conservative part of our government and
[SPEAKER_01]: people that still are afraid of cannabis
is the whole idea of how they framed
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that we're going to get the all the
organized crime out and we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: restrict access to kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like we're legalizing cannabis
and have changed our mentality around this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a wonderful, beautiful plant that's a
solution to so many of our world's
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just like Forrest said with
locking the little girl in the in the
[SPEAKER_05]: basement and letting her out 40 years
later.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's pale and pasty and she's a
little crooked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like that's what we're trying to
legalize right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of saw your vision there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forrest, when you said if prohibition had
never happened, we would never set this up
[SPEAKER_05]: the way we're setting it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank God for people like yourself and
people like Hillary or who are sort of on
[SPEAKER_05]: the front lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really have to go to these Senate
hearings.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really have to go to these lawmakers
and these politicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Etienne has been doing it for a
long, long time as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it's important work that,
you know, not everyone wants to do,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the people that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because you got to suit up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to suit up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's no joke right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to suit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to where we were talking
about cultural change and the impact that
[SPEAKER_02]: has on the laws we want to see reflected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sam, those group, those
propaganda, awful organizations just
[SPEAKER_02]: spread probably some of the worst
disinformation I've seen here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a panel on teen and drug use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, all the information that
the schools brought for the drug education
[SPEAKER_02]: they're giving our kids came from Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not even true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you if you look at the if you
want to like super nerd out and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the panel that was in the afternoon on the
twenty third, a dear friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosie Mondan, has been doing some amazing
government relations on behalf of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: She spoke and she just gutted Sam's
credibility to the Senate like she just
[SPEAKER_01]: fully tackled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had also organized to have like 30 of
the country's leading researchers to work
[SPEAKER_01]: together to organize a rebuttal document
to their document.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she fully gutted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day they put out a press
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had it to put the link out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put out a press release about like
Rosie Mondan slandering them and they she
[SPEAKER_01]: she produces extraction equipment and they
put a picture of her extraction machine
[SPEAKER_01]: with this big red arrow to these gummy
bears and was like this woman's personally
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for trying to get your kids
high in a press release.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was so it's just high
drama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking on Rosie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I do, I just want to say one quick
thing to that beautiful angel of a woman,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelly, sitting there who has been sent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, can I say without crying?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tear up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelly has been sending me medicine for my
dog and my dog has bone cancer and is
[SPEAKER_01]: really sore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the medicine that Kelly is sending for
my Ringo is like transforming our life and
[SPEAKER_01]: letting me have some quality time with him
towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just nobody's ever really I've never
really needed anybody to step up for me or
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody in my family the way that I do
for Ringo right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those treats that you make,
we need to get them to all of the canine
[SPEAKER_01]: nation everywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like such potent medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely my honor because I feel
like you just touched on really the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why we're all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has incredible healing powers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only does it have incredible
healing powers, but it connects us and it
[SPEAKER_00]: connects us in very deep ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter how much politics that we
talk about or pesticides, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a love flow that goes through this
plant and connects us all and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's watching this show and everybody
who's connected to this plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all hold such an important part of
this puzzle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just want to give you so much
strength and so much love for being on the
[SPEAKER_09]: front lines for us all in that realm and
being able to suit up and do that and use
[SPEAKER_09]: your voice in the way that you do and
being so eloquent with it is tremendously
[SPEAKER_09]: important to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't matter what kind of gardening
we would do at all if it weren't for
[SPEAKER_09]: people like you that were really helping
us to be free with it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my honor to support Ringo who
supports you, who you support everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get them, tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much love and hugs through Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hillary, thank you so much for being a
leader and showing everybody how it's done
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's people like you that have
guided people like me and others along the
[SPEAKER_03]: way that have made us realize that it is
eternal vigilance and that it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't just do it this week and then
walk away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a constant eternal vigilance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for being such a wonderful
leader that you are humbled and honored to
[SPEAKER_03]: know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for crying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, ask her where to find the video with
Rosie Montin where she destroys Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get her to send you the link.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the Senate's and it's all
definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Rosie's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would I want to watch that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hanging out with her a little bit
yesterday and she's just got a real lively
[SPEAKER_05]: fiery passion for cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said earlier, a lot of the people
that I met yesterday, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there are a lot of people who are
passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's good to see and it's good to
be a part of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sometimes I think we get lost
because we've been fighting for so long
[SPEAKER_05]: for this that, you know, for the longest
time we were literally being jailed,
[SPEAKER_05]: imprisoned, having our lives destroyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we fought and fought and
fought and fought.
[SPEAKER_05]: And although that's still happening in
some states and a lot of different
[SPEAKER_05]: countries, and the fight is nowhere near
over, it's over for so many of us who now
[SPEAKER_05]: have federal exemptions and who have
legalization around the corner and huge
[SPEAKER_05]: things in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it happens, you know, obviously we
get comfortable with and quickly forget
[SPEAKER_05]: about that even happening and start
bitching about the next thing on the top
[SPEAKER_05]: of the list.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want everyone to remember that
the next thing on the top of the list is
[SPEAKER_05]: way, way, way down the list from being
imprisoned and having our children take
[SPEAKER_05]: away from us.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, the next most important thing on
the list is is the work that that Forrest
[SPEAKER_05]: and Hillary and Etienne, all these people
are doing in regards to the politics to
[SPEAKER_05]: really like Hillary was not joking when
she said these guys are in kindergarten
[SPEAKER_05]: when it comes to their cannabis knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't really be harsh and
judgmental.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just ignorant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was actually this is a fun one going
to what Forrest is saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had actually I have school
administrators for high schools and middle
[SPEAKER_03]: schools reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually going to give private
seminars on Saturdays and educate these
[SPEAKER_03]: people on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all they have is the knowledge
from Sam and all these other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not real.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk to the experts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they actually reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually in a couple of weeks
going to along with my HR director,
[SPEAKER_03]: take education and research and show these
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as you said, they're all
neophytes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are literally at ground zero of no
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to start with these teachers
and administrators on my day off and
[SPEAKER_03]: educate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that they can go back and then teach
their other teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the health schools in next
year, they're going to be teaching them
[SPEAKER_03]: what's really out there for them for
cannabis because they have no knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state of California is giving them no
bit of understanding about what these kids
[SPEAKER_03]: should be taught besides all that lies and
misinformation that's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, shows you that, you know,
we have to take it upon our shoulders to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it ourselves, to actually educate these
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to educate your teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that they can throw out this dare
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it just shows me that
somebody needs to start a business just to
[SPEAKER_03]: educate these people so that they can just
go around and say, A, this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: B, this is medical chemists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just start off with the simples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as you know, as you've seen,
when you go to Sacramento, you start
[SPEAKER_03]: talking cannabis and you just can see
their eyes just glaze up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we literally have to start at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's great news at 10 starting
with the children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the teachers and getting that
information out, you know, probably people
[SPEAKER_05]: don't realize how much of the propaganda
in, you know, negative cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: how much of it really was promoted,
obviously, through the prohibition and the
[SPEAKER_05]: and the policing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big part because that's very
scary having your door kicked in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the next ones on the list,
in my opinion, were Hollywood constantly
[SPEAKER_05]: making derogatory jokes in movies and TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the the miseducation and
the misinformation of our children at
[SPEAKER_05]: schools with programs like Pride and Dare.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sam, these are these are these are
just straightforward misinformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're just, you know,
trying to teach children on one side about
[SPEAKER_05]: certain truths and you're just filling it
in with lies about other things,
[SPEAKER_05]: this does nothing but confuse confused
children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it's the it's the birth of
brainwashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not only does it confuse them,
but it's it's harmful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think one of the biggest
impacts is that the schools, these dare
[SPEAKER_02]: programs, these SAM programs are doing
what they're blaming cannabis for,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is typically this this false gateway
analogy where cannabis will become a
[SPEAKER_02]: gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe that a lot of these programs
are what really contributes to that
[SPEAKER_02]: misconception, because they teach kids
from a very young age that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between heroin and cannabis and
that there's no difference between cocaine
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis and meth and cannabis and
alcohol and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, kids grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get in high school, typically with a
experiment with what might be around
[SPEAKER_02]: first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times that is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you teach kids that there's no
difference between cannabis and meth and
[SPEAKER_02]: then what they taught was a lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts the door to believe that there was
a lie with these other drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I absolutely believe it contributes to
the abuse of some of these other drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: through the misinformation education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a victimless crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really sad to see some of the
most conservative we want to help the kids
[SPEAKER_02]: folks buy in to a treatment plan that
actually teaches kids to not believe what
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been taught down the road about
dangerous drugs and opens the door to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it easier for them to experiment with
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of been in California culture
for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a little bit different story here
when we go like I was just in
[SPEAKER_10]: Massachusetts at a town hall meeting for
somebody petitioning for a license and a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of people there could barely wrap
their heads around medical or just wrap
[SPEAKER_10]: their heads around medical.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you have to throw the
recreational in now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like a whole different aspect to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like medical was fine for a minute for
most people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then recreational, I was super
surprised to hear how many people that
[SPEAKER_10]: were, you know, for medical out there,
but totally against recreational.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was like reefer madness on the same
plant or the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what are we talking about here?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you know, what's recreational?
[SPEAKER_10]: On Saturdays medical on Monday.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's true or not,
but I mean, it's just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: what is the difference between medical and
recreational besides taxes and money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, there's nothing difference
in the application, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: other than that, it's all grown the same
way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but when people want to smoke weed
and they go buy some flowers, I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: one person might say, I use it for medical
and the guy next to him might say,
[SPEAKER_10]: I use this for recreational.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so people are torn in two different
ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, especially in other States where
cannabis isn't a part of the culture,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's really this defining line of,
you know, is this medical, is this
[SPEAKER_10]: recreational?
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it even right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I just was in the DARE class last
week or whatever, like Forrest was saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: So California is kind of unique into its
own because of the culture, but these
[SPEAKER_10]: other States I've been going to,
it's, it's a serious controversy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on the medical versus recreational
topic alone.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what was surprising to me,
because I'm just used to being,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, cannabis period and every
instant reef from madness.
[SPEAKER_10]: But now the argument for medical and
recreational is like even more absurd in
[SPEAKER_10]: some ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another way to divide.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, you know, this,
it's a, it's this cultural sin that is
[SPEAKER_02]: applied to recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes back to like this whole,
you know, it reminds me of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this whole Christian, you know,
don't masturbate, don't have sex,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that involves some sort of
pleasure of the human body is inherently
[SPEAKER_02]: evil and wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have here with cannabis is just
this inherent, we don't know why we
[SPEAKER_02]: believe it, but it's been ingrained in us
from day one that it's bad or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that changes your state of mind is bad and
evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to grow out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We absolutely have to stop associating,
using things that make us feel different
[SPEAKER_02]: to relieve stress or just because we want
to feel different as inherently bad if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not harmful.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the body and to the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And was that a pun intended when you said
we have to grow out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the division between recreation
and medical, obviously someone mentioned
[SPEAKER_05]: it in chat that the difference,
I guess, could be construed as intense,
[SPEAKER_05]: but aren't they both really also
preventative?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you're using cannabis as a
medicine and you're saturating your
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid system and you're
regulating your biological functions the
[SPEAKER_05]: way they need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't there a form of prevention involved
whether you're using medicinally for one
[SPEAKER_05]: specific element or you're using
recreationally to feel a certain way?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there's also a preventative
aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, I'm not sure that we should be
too worried.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the real division to me between
recreational and medical isn't in the
[SPEAKER_05]: intention of the person, but it's in the
quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when people use radioactive
tobacco as a recreational product and they
[SPEAKER_05]: use poisonous alcohols and all sorts of
different things, and they're adults,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's called adult use, they should be
allowed to do what they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to sort of endanger your own
health, it shouldn't be anyone else's
[SPEAKER_05]: issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when your health is already
endangered, when you have some serious
[SPEAKER_05]: ailment, you need to be knowing that the
medicine that you're purchasing is being
[SPEAKER_05]: produced on a level that may be beyond and
above what could be sold as recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be some distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just because dosage limits alone
make it a challenge when we blur medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: and recreational uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is how we're using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're working with the BCC in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually got them to raise the limit up
to 10,000 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we have, for example,
this perception of recreational use or
[SPEAKER_02]: someone just wants to change their state
of mind as opposed to treating a tumor
[SPEAKER_02]: issue or an endocannabinoid deficiency
disorder, we have, what is it in
[SPEAKER_02]: California?
[SPEAKER_02]: 18, five milligram doses per serving?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it is right now, I think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it 10?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 100 maximum in a packaging,
so most people are doing 10, or you're
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing people also do those micro dosing,
pastules, things like that, micro dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get conditions that need six,
seven, 800, 1,300 milligram a day dosing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're restricted through sort of
that intention, the intention of how it's
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be used, then you put patients
in a really tough position.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really get a lot of
therapeutically dosed products still in
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries because of some of these
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I agree with everything you say,
Marcus, but we at the same time have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to maybe draw some in the
legislature, draw some sort of distinction
[SPEAKER_02]: on how it's used and intended to be used
so that those products can be available
[SPEAKER_02]: for patients that need them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The recreational stripped the medical
abilities in California quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't believe the access people
do not have anymore, and the expense
[SPEAKER_10]: people are paying to try to get the same
medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I was at the high time, I decided to
go to the Sacramento High Times Cup kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of because it was the first legal
whatever, and I'm not that far away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I went down and really popular
gummies that I could buy at a farmer's
[SPEAKER_10]: market last summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And up north or whatever, you know,
we're 100 milligram box, each gummy was 10
[SPEAKER_10]: milligrams, and it was $25 plus all the
tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, I can't imagine somebody that
would have to rely on seven or 800
[SPEAKER_10]: milligrams a day and have to go buy it
legally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I mean, it would bankrupt them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm hearing that from other
people, but I guess I just didn't realize
[SPEAKER_10]: it for myself till I did a little shopping
around, you know, go buy some flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the jar of flowers was like this tax,
that tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, here I was like,
well, this is fun for a second,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it was really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we separate, you know,
the idea of recreational from medical at
[SPEAKER_00]: all?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that like the Industrial
Revolution, like nine to five that all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden said that there's some kind of
difference between our well-being and our
[SPEAKER_00]: health and the way that we recreate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, we already know
scientifically that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be happy boost your immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're recreating, like you were
saying earlier, Marcus, that's only
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention for the diseases that come down
the line for, you know, getting tumors and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything being happy is the most
important thing that we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that means, you know, token on your
cannabis or eating your gummies for a good
[SPEAKER_00]: price and it's a healthy way of living,
then that's just only going to make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: for I just don't see the separation in any
way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's just a lot of political
rhetoric and taxes that just put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it really interesting that,
you know, in the eighteen hundreds and all
[SPEAKER_09]: the apothecaries of the world,
you know, as we stated before,
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis was the main ingredient in all of
what we used from the apothecary that we
[SPEAKER_09]: went for, you know, healing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, here came the
prohibition and the an slinger and all the
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff that came in the monkeys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now all of a sudden we're getting re
brainwashed into being like, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is like this is a drug.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then and then here comes nineteen
ninety six.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, actually, it's a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then so we have all this opening up of
mindsets because it's medical and we all,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, as a culture, we get excited
because, oh, my God, this is the best news
[SPEAKER_09]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, everything that we were working
for, it's medically good for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all these studies come out and then
this big dark cloud of legalization comes
[SPEAKER_09]: and recreational.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all of a sudden it's like,
forget about the whole medical thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a taxable item.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in debt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go corporations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's sell taxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's sell shares.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just feels like it insults our
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I have to say about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they still have differential testing
rights?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I thought I remember, like in
Washington state, they had testing regs
[SPEAKER_04]: for the recreational market and none for
the medical market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the medical market became the dumping
ground for all the stuff that failed the
[SPEAKER_04]: rec market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still going on or do they they
finally like write that chip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in college.
[SPEAKER_12]: They talk about medical medical
completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something more recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're really fighting that here in
California because, you know, so the
[SPEAKER_02]: Gladius Network is a children's agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who don't know, we deal with
pediatrics terminally and catastrophically
[SPEAKER_12]: ill.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they don't have a lot of progressive
loss, and it's because of the merging of
[SPEAKER_02]: the adult use recreational medical
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a big difference between CBD
gummies and what is necessary for treating
[SPEAKER_02]: rare, difficult neurological conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the problem is, is you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could just say that if we if we're
saying cannabis is free and we can do what
[SPEAKER_02]: we want with it, well, then there's no
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, we have the limits that
are being imposed from a recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are limits because people aren't
using cannabis responsibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and this is where I push back a
little bit on the all uses medicinal use,
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, you can go on YouTube
and Google, you know, college kids first
[SPEAKER_02]: dab in some of these videos where you see
kids completely cannabis naive taking huge
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs that cause paralysis in one kid in
the videos online.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes into a full panic attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's freaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can actually be damaging for folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that fear of that happening,
you know, is putting laws in place that
[SPEAKER_02]: make medicinal not the medicinal needs for
therapeutic levels really difficult to to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, I agree, but it's a
complex conversation that whatever is
[SPEAKER_02]: decided to be done, if we have to
differentiate to ensure access,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we differentiate until we get to a
point where we can realize that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: is safe and it can just be open.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is that we're putting limits
on medicinal cannabis to prevent people
[SPEAKER_02]: ending up in the hospital because they ate
too many brownies that are preventing
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer patients and epileptics from
getting what they need to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their life depends on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that and that is a definitely medicine
and necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I feel like, you know,
it really is being caught up in politics
[SPEAKER_00]: and rhetoric and, you know, getting back
on that kid that took the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really the cannabis that did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it the pesticides, you know,
that caused that in that child?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a total side side
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that it is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're starting to separate out a
plant that's just totally good for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it becomes political.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it becomes money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's where we all get messed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're having all of these
conversations where these people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the culture from the very
beginning, bringing it forward or no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer able to be part of a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a pharmaceutical company is taking
it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pharmaceutical company isn't
getting rights and access.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just becomes a whole muddled problem,
which really is representative of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to brush it off on all
politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis now has become a political
discussion.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw a lot of 40s and 50 year olds laid
out on the ground at high times from
[SPEAKER_10]: taking their first two big of a dab or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've seen it in Amsterdam,
people eating too many edibles and just
[SPEAKER_05]: collapsing on the on the cobblestone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sometimes violent and it
sometimes actually involves pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I always love Forrest's perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a very unique perspective in all of
this, having a very sick child and coming
[SPEAKER_05]: to this from Silas's perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a perspective that any of us
could possibly have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always find it very just very
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love his confidence and always like
whether it's creating a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: discomfort and just saying what he has to
say, because it's it's very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, I know I know Kelly and
Josh and I know how they've got these
[SPEAKER_05]: great healthy people in their lives,
healthy son.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have seen him use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they have this other unique
perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just neat to see the two
perspectives interact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And talk about this this importance
because on, you know, from one
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective, you can see like,
oh, why why do we need to differentiate?
[SPEAKER_05]: We shouldn't have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can see from Forrest's
perspective, it's like, well, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have to differentiate.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if that's the way I have to do it to
ensure that my son and other kids like him
[SPEAKER_05]: get clean medicine and access,
then I will jump through whatever hoop I
[SPEAKER_05]: have to jump to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I agree with everything Kelly and
Josh has said.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it goes back to our you know,
this all circles back to the general lack
[SPEAKER_02]: of real education and understanding in our
lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it comes back to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is when when they hear
there's no difference, then they falsely
[SPEAKER_02]: assume, well, that dispensary is open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have all the medicine you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't understand the nuance of what
needs to continue to be allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I agree with everything Kelly
and Josh said.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, as a parent and someone who
works with pediatrics and children,
[SPEAKER_02]: it definitely is highlighted to me where
some of those concepts actually are
[SPEAKER_02]: causing harm because of the lack of
understanding in our lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally agree with you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's it's it's such a it's such
a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so important for the work that's
being done for the children and bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's become so taboo, you know,
with the idea that it's only recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if it's only recreational,
then we can't give it to our kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just isn't isn't the case at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes real muddled in the in the
education of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are we going to bring this
education forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes, you know, all forms of the
medicine as well as all uses of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess it's from a grower at the end,
at the end, when it's all said and done.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really just matters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it grown properly and clean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because whether the recreational or
medical, I think we should just try and
[SPEAKER_09]: make it healthy, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and 40 percent of what it is that
you're getting, you know, is coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty just is really representative of,
you know, what's going on in the toxins of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not something that is
acceptable or OK in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a whole other force of education
that needs to come forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a question for the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone asked it earlier and they were
asking about irradiated cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_05]: that's affecting cannabis and how that
might be affecting patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is something that's happening
in Canada where there's a federally
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so does anyone know much on the part
of the panel about irradiated cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Arno did a study on it and showed
that, you know, it it definitely takes
[SPEAKER_03]: care of the molds and mildews,
but it definitely destroys the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't destroy them all, but it
affected the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It affects them significantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we need to see what is that actual
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you actually smoked it
compared to the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: can you actually taste a flavor
difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there an onset difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that needs to be studied,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just because that one study come
out, that leads to, as you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Kevin would say, more studies need
to take place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we explain what irradiated weed would
be or what the process is?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a good point to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I from what I understand,
it's what we've seen at the Lyft Expo is
[SPEAKER_09]: it's an irradiating machine that has like
a conveyor belt that goes through it and
[SPEAKER_09]: it brings the the buds through and
irradiates it to like take to take away
[SPEAKER_09]: the radiation.
[SPEAKER_09]: The responsibility of the grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just basically say now grow what you
want.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll clean it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like the distillate thing in
a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't a UV light.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pushing it through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what Wikipedia says is it's it's the
process of exposing food and food
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging to ionization radiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ionizing radiation such from gamma rays,
x-rays or electron beams is energy that
[SPEAKER_05]: can be transmitted without direct contact
to the source of the energy radiation
[SPEAKER_05]: capable of freeing electrons from their
atomic bonds in the targeted food.
[SPEAKER_05]: The radiation can be emitted by a
radioactive substance or generated
[SPEAKER_05]: electrically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this treatment is used to improve food
safety by extending product shelf life
[SPEAKER_05]: preservation, reducing the risk of
foodborne illnesses and delaying or
[SPEAKER_05]: eliminating sprouting or ripening by
sterilization of foods and as a means of
[SPEAKER_05]: controlling insects and invasive pests.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's actually technically it's
every potato you eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it radiated?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of foods are actually irradiated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's it's just but like once again,
we could say that putting food in our
[SPEAKER_05]: stomachs might be a little bit different
than inhaling molecules into our lungs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the terpene profile itself is being
affected, then how bad is it being
[SPEAKER_05]: affected if we know that terpenes modulate
the effects of cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are probably fairly important to be
left alone the way they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I just thought it would be an
interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can get someone on here in the
next couple of weeks that knows a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit more about it and could share with us
because I I would like to know more about
[SPEAKER_05]: it myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing I really don't know much
when someone asks me about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: irradiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arno would be the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's really expensive and
whatever like products and stuff that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have out there that we've seen within
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're talking about it in the
pharmaceutical industry big time because
[SPEAKER_00]: they irradiate all different types of
herbs for supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just immediately done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it involves any type of the health
industry in any way, then it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: irradiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of our teas are
irradiated, celestial seasonings,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different types of teas that
we might be drinking every day that
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize herbs as being irradiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically takes away, you know,
the entire life force of of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'd love to learn more from Arno
or anyone like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also I would just question you know,
the residue that it leaves if we know
[SPEAKER_09]: myclobutanol, just for example,
is the easiest one, you know, continues to
[SPEAKER_09]: radiate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why wouldn't that happen in the ganja?
[SPEAKER_09]: And what, you know, cyanobacterias and my,
you know, other smaller bacteria,
[SPEAKER_09]: what kind of those probiotic cultures are
getting irradiated out as well?
[SPEAKER_09]: And once again, you know, that's an input
to our human body.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want like a whole food as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why Whole Foods, not the company,
but what you know, a whole food is so
[SPEAKER_09]: important.
[SPEAKER_09]: And growing your own food is more alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, it's just another example of
kind of processed food.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like it's processed weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, you can get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know the specific science on
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, I don't trust it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't want to have anything to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want to pipe in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me, I've read in the science
that microbiology, particularly bacteria,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I imagine fungus have an ability to
share their DNA and pick up resistance
[SPEAKER_06]: from each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems to me that iridating
microbiology is going to explode all of
[SPEAKER_06]: that DNA into a mad soup, like you were
just talking about, Josh.
[SPEAKER_06]: And meantime, consuming it into the lungs
sounds like a really terrible idea to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this just goes to what I was saying,
and I agree with Josh 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this goes back, and we can do a whole
show on this that all cannabis has the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential for medicinal use, but is not
safe or good for medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it's used is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see it in the deaths of immune
compromised cancer patients, and if the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is clean and prepared properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a complex topic that we could do a
whole show on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that really highlights that
point well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll have to get a little deeper
into that later on in the year here,
[SPEAKER_05]: once we can maybe get some more key
players involved with the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just put Arno's paper up there on the
chat group.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's got some measurement of the
differential effects on the monoterpenes
[SPEAKER_04]: and the sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do gamma irradiate, you do lose
some of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that could probably be compensated for
with spike ends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had read the paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it was a change.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 20% or 30%.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you could probably overcome it with
spike ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bedrocan is considered the quote
unquote standard because they were the
[SPEAKER_03]: first regulated sort of situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But their cannabis is irradiated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just an FYI more than anything
for people to realize that that's where it
[SPEAKER_03]: is considered as an international
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needed to be that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's also, as everybody was saying,
a reflection on the growers themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The growers of that flower, there's a need
for it to be irradiated because it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: free of molds and mildews, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make that sloppily and then just
irradiate it, where are the microtoxins?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it takes away the responsibility
from possibly really large corporations
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just coming in to produce money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not really into producing a
health product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a real differentiation with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of people that are in
North Northern Cali and in Southern Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: and people who have brought this culture
forward, they're producing a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're producing something of importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that can just be put
out onto the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd actually like to do a study looking
at irradiated samples just to know what.
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect the DNA is still there,
although there might be some thymidine
[SPEAKER_04]: cross-linkers going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes irradiation will crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be interesting to see whether
or not we can pick it up because my only
[SPEAKER_04]: concern of using something like that is
that you mask all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that you had tons of mold on the
plant and the fact that you've made it so
[SPEAKER_04]: it's non-viable doesn't mean that you've
necessarily made it safe because those are
[SPEAKER_04]: still allergens.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still get effects like allergies
with powdery mildew and metritis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the few places I've seen using this
have powdery mildew everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even bother to deal with it or
breed around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just basically say, that doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go and irradiate it and
it'll all be fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody got into cannabis because they were
farmers in the first place.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got into cannabis because they wanted
to grow some weeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at the end of the day, when people
don't give a shit or have the skills or
[SPEAKER_10]: the background or the support,
what happens is what happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of places that are legal,
not necessarily in California,
[SPEAKER_10]: but other states, it's not optimal growing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's places in Humboldt and on the
coast where it's the hardest places to
[SPEAKER_10]: grow ever.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not really much choice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's taken some people two to three years
to refine their skills to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_10]: something without PM and without mold
before legalization and all these things
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's just not optimal growing
conditions or optimal greenhouses or
[SPEAKER_10]: spaces to use because of legalization puts
them in all these weird places.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so at the end of the day, irradiation
and these things are going to exist
[SPEAKER_10]: because they have no potential to pump out
good shit in the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's going to have PM and it's
going to run through some problems and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're not going to throw that shit away.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just the way this mentality goes
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Only the craft people have the,
it's got PM, let's throw it away and start
[SPEAKER_10]: over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's test our soil and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the bottom of these things
and figure out the health of the problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when you go to the business trade
shows for the most part, everybody's
[SPEAKER_10]: drinking alcohol and cannabis isn't
allowed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the one thing that you see from booth
to booth to booth is what kind of spray,
[SPEAKER_10]: what kind of UV light, what kind of
technology they have to kill mold,
[SPEAKER_10]: to kill PM, to get rid of all these
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, again, we're almost like big
pharma.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the pill to fix this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the pill to fix that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a side effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take this pill.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the health, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a pill.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, we're not going to grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only a fraction of people that are
going to grow healthy and do this right in
[SPEAKER_10]: the long run.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because again, the places that are legal
have the odds against them, whether it's
[SPEAKER_10]: the weather, it's the soil and the
neighbors spraying shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, I mean, at the end of the day,
the bubble is going to burst, but
[SPEAKER_10]: unfortunately a lot of people have thrown
in the towel and moved away and some
[SPEAKER_10]: things like that up North.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I try to get it past the doom and
the gloom stories all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know there's some cool breakthroughs
and I mean, don't you have one coming up
[SPEAKER_10]: here, Micah?
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you have something opening up or
some cool things for leaf expanding,
[SPEAKER_10]: opening up or doing some new stuff?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know there's a lot of problems
and some things going on, but I know that
[SPEAKER_10]: you had shared some stuff that you were
getting ready to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you threw me off there.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as projects that we have going on,
yeah, we are working on some different
[SPEAKER_07]: projects, but, you know, building some new
facilities and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: But because you guys are organic,
you guys are like what do we talk about?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a craft farmer.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the fans just kicked on in the back,
so they go on for a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're an organic farmer in Northern
and Southern California.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're permitted.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're testing all over the place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you're still, you don't,
I don't know if you have a big investor
[SPEAKER_10]: behind you or anything like that,
but I mean, you've always come from a
[SPEAKER_10]: small crafts style farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all on our own.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't have a big investor.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, our take on it is that you got
to get it right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so your farming techniques have
to be down and don't rely on all these new
[SPEAKER_07]: things that are popping up with,
you know, sprays.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was actually going to ask you guys,
someone brought this up to me the other
[SPEAKER_07]: day.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had heard anything about the
irradiation thing sounds to me like it's
[SPEAKER_07]: some sort of pasteurization process or
something that, you know, is because of
[SPEAKER_07]: you screwed up in the, you know,
in your farming techniques possibly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's a way to not throw away
product that probably should be thrown
[SPEAKER_07]: into the trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone was in our office the other
day asking about, there's something in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado that they're introducing where
it's something similar, but it's a spray.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have any of you guys heard of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where they're talking about spraying down
the flower and the different product as a
[SPEAKER_07]: preservative and actually turning it into
a law?
[SPEAKER_04]: They are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking about doing, putting
tracers on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they want to spike it with some type of
molecule they can trace.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're talking about DNA,
but I know it's not clear to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo has a grant to try and figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems incredibly foolish to do this
because you could actually just track the
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA itself from the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how to do that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you really want a barcode,
just read the native DNA of the plant as
[SPEAKER_04]: opposed to adding some other DNA to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that brings up all types of
concerns when you start doing that,
[SPEAKER_04]: because generally when you spray DNA on
things, it's not going to integrate with
[SPEAKER_04]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can get viruses and other things,
bacteria to package that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there could be perhaps off-target
integration events.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems really foolish what they're
trying to do, because it's one more
[SPEAKER_04]: compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not so much worried about the DNA,
because that's probably fairly native.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more, what are they going to package
it with?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the foliar spray they solubilize it
in?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like the adjuvants are
oftentimes more dangerous than the actual
[SPEAKER_04]: thing you're trying to apply.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they want to do this to get taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seed to sale tracking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now the RFID tags are getting
ripped off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not only for taxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to be able to trace it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to be able to find out,
because we have the same access of
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics as anyone else, as dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to figure out if this is from
the illegal market or if it's from the
[SPEAKER_03]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the problem of prohibition and
the problem of reintegration from
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition now is that these straight
prohibitionists want to figure out any
[SPEAKER_03]: way, shape, or form to fuck with us on a
certain resolve that seems to be the case
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, again, it could be traced,
as you say, by actually doing genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is that we can genetically
access the same genetics on the illegal
[SPEAKER_03]: market through seeds, et cetera,
clones, et cetera, as opposed to what's in
[SPEAKER_03]: the legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they're trying to do is find a
separation between the legal produce
[SPEAKER_03]: market and the illegal market,
which, I mean, they could chase their
[SPEAKER_03]: tails forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, trying to make up this sort of
mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's why they're doing this,
people, because they're just trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out how a police, if they find a
type of cannabis and they test it,
[SPEAKER_03]: they say, OK, this is from the legal
market as opposed to, oh, you bought this
[SPEAKER_03]: illegally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're still trying to use this to
entrap and to put people in jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: God, that just sounds like a terrible
idea, like some sort of spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sounds like paraquad all over
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a terrible idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why you have to be active.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why you have to go out and meet
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who here knows their actual
representative?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who has them on speed dial?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how active you have to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only two of us, a couple of us raised our
hands here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be every single one of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should know who your representative
is, and then you hear stupidity like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: My representative is Hillary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's doing something about it right
now, bless her soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just text her, and I'm like,
you've got to talk to these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you have their number.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Hillary always comes out smelling
like a rose, even when she basically
[SPEAKER_05]: demolishes them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Hillary's done the same thing Rosie's
done over the years, but somehow Rosie
[SPEAKER_05]: gets a rebuttal from Sam on the web page,
bashing her in a public forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty hardcore.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a real honor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be very proud of that if I was
her.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure she is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she loves it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what some of these companies don't
realize and some of these just people that
[SPEAKER_05]: are doing the wrong things out there,
that it seems like this day and age is the
[SPEAKER_05]: day and age of accountability.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you're maybe not going to be
getting away with the same old same old
[SPEAKER_05]: bullshit that you've been getting away for
the longest time because now people are
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhat organized through social media
and they're able to gather in a way that
[SPEAKER_05]: just makes it so easy that suddenly you
realize there's hundreds of thousands or
[SPEAKER_05]: millions of people against this particular
way of thinking, and that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, I got to get going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to take off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good talking to you guys again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to have everyone back here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also actually have to get going.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Lyft conference is over in a couple
hours, and it's the last day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everyone for coming out
and making time and sharing your stories
[SPEAKER_05]: and your information, and I will
absolutely be inviting you all back again
[SPEAKER_05]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully for next Sunday, we'll do
another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, if anyone has any ideas
on specific conversations that they want
[SPEAKER_05]: to discuss, we can do specific shows where
we invite specific panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do both the spur of the moment,
hash church, where whoever can come can
[SPEAKER_05]: come and we'll make that happen,
but also have some times where we actually
[SPEAKER_05]: create and produce a show for a special
Sunday where specific people are coming in
[SPEAKER_05]: to talk about specific things and they
make sure that they have the time and the
[SPEAKER_05]: space to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, yeah, we'll be posting
all the links in the hash church Facebook
[SPEAKER_05]: page in regards to things that we talked
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Kevin is probably already doing it,
but he'll post some things in that
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook page as he often does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep on keeping on everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all doing great jobs, great work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Sean for hanging out and
sitting with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sean's a local organic farmer here who can
be found on Instagram at Lost Gardens and
[SPEAKER_05]: a righteous brother from another mother.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to head off to Lyft and see if
we can't talk some sense into some of
[SPEAKER_05]: these cannabis parasites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about mites or some of
these other real cannabis parasites that
[SPEAKER_05]: are approaching the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean we can't just stop going
to these shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just another way to create
divisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make sure we go to the
shows and educate the way we educate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank the entire audience in the chat room
right now whose dedication to hash church
[SPEAKER_05]: is above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do appreciate you for doing that,
coming in all the time, sharing the links
[SPEAKER_05]: and getting it so we can have 500 or 600
people watching live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, D420K.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Eric and Etienne and Wade and
Kevin and Skunkman Sam who came and went,
