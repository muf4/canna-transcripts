[SPEAKER_09]: Hey welcome to Bubble Man's World
everybody and welcome to Puff Wednesday
[SPEAKER_09]: with Johnny B!
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it's been a while!
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B of course has his own channel
these days over at John Berfello.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it John Berfello on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Johnny B, it's John Berfello.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny Berfello, awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect, well dude, here we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: First time in a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to check out some of the rosin
that I squeezed out on the press.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to discuss today a little
bit of Canadian politics in regards to
[SPEAKER_09]: recently the power change that we had here
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're here on Davie Street at the CCHQ
Vapor Lounge, the upstairs Vapor Lounge.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're just going to film a little
sequence today.
[SPEAKER_09]: The West Coast Concentrate guys are going
to join us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And jeez, I think you should start it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying... You're not saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: You want me to squeeze you one out there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice little piece of rosin that I pressed
out to check out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a little piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me show you this nice little piece of
rosin that I pressed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, it's so nice to have a
rosin in a Vapor Lounge because I can just
[SPEAKER_06]: hear him saying legalize what's just
recently happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think both Bob and Peter,
of course it was Peter Tosh's 70th or 71st
[SPEAKER_09]: Earth Strong the other day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was 70 or 71, or he would have
been had he still been around today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I celebrated that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go, a little rip for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's Turb Rich.
[SPEAKER_09]: Turb Rich.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to cruise around.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go chill with the West
Coast Concentrate guys today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll probably grab a bite to eat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Might even check out the other Cannabis
Culture Vapor Lounge and just have an all
[SPEAKER_09]: around beautiful day at Puff and Bowls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, of course, the background is
the Blue Jays game, which is like the
[SPEAKER_09]: first time in 30 years or some ridiculous
thing that they made it to close to the
[SPEAKER_09]: World Series.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they have this one more game.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, World Series.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big deal for people that care about
this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: in the alternative group.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew the folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew they were going in and I knew they
were talking about the Cannabis and I know
[SPEAKER_06]: what's happening in the Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the realm of what's happening in
baseball, not as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless he was puffing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's to a nice Puff Wednesday rip
with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, I decided to bring my
beautiful ball rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to probably use this
somewhere else because of course,
[SPEAKER_06]: we've got a dual D-nail set up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mark was telling me how he has a
cyclamen set up because he's getting into
[SPEAKER_06]: the ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it was kind of interesting how you
were explaining it to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm asking him a question while he
does this great big ball talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what friends do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so they know that when they're
finished, they've got to start talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, basically, I unplug it at 620.
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw it into the base unit.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's turned on to just over a
thousand degrees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll heat up the ball, clean it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing we're missing right now is
a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been using Q-tips and I don't have
one on me.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have one, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's always just with the Q-tip tech,
of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see how clean that washes out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's just a matter of really
giving it that last little pump of air.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll probably be less than five minutes
and we'll be able to... A lot of people,
[SPEAKER_09]: when I was using the Q-tip, they freaked
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like... Cleaning out the residuals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cleaning out the residuals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting rid of that carpet and it's not
lighting on fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting how this isn't this cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does the job, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the nail itself has only really
turned up to about 600 degrees.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I even kind of cleaned it up out of a
bowl that was close to 800 degrees.
[SPEAKER_09]: I still haven't had it set up.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Q-tips, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Q-tip definitely works.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to call it a tech because really
all it is is taking a Q-tip and cleaning a
[SPEAKER_09]: bowl with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to give everything a name with
tech now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does the good job and especially...
This is a tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: Huffing certain ways in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of that new paper
instead of parchment?
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen this before.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, the thing I like about
this is that it has no special coating
[SPEAKER_09]: unlike parchment which is silicone coated
and the parchment coating comes off in the
[SPEAKER_09]: heat pressing of the rosin as well as the
constant opening and closing it on the
[SPEAKER_09]: oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you get is you get that coating
starting to release and people can see it
[SPEAKER_09]: in how they start noticing that the rosin
isn't coming off nice anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's starting to stick to the parchment,
almost seep into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That generally means that your coating is
gone and I don't really understand exactly
[SPEAKER_09]: what's happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know enough that if the coating is
coming off in the hash or oil,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to be smoking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, pretty much if it's coming off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going into the hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way I feel about it for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have another couple of little rips
of some West Coast Concentrate maybe here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here he is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Curious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to turn the nail down
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like it that you drop me off these new
rosin bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have the regular.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just filming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I join?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, come on in and join.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you're not trying to hit
solvent based extracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the solventless.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw the look on the face.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what everyone has.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome to come puff some bulls
with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have plenty.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll show you what I got.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, have a hit of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that rosin or what?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is some bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, we've got to just give you a cool
down on the nail here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was your name, bro?
Adam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam, I'm Adam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam works downstairs.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to come down and check him
out, he's down at the, I guess it's the
[SPEAKER_09]: CCHQ Davy Street.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been so many names over the years
that I have to think of.
[SPEAKER_09]: ECMP, CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sister, what was her name?
[SPEAKER_09]: That she bought it from Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before that it was Hemp BC, but even Hemp
BC had all sorts of different creations.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been around since 96 or 95,
but it kind of all started.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a few incarnations,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Props to Mark Henry for keeping it alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just for me, from my perspective,
I'm at the point where I just,
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the flowers even though you
need to pay for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: West Coast Concentrate crew in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm coming to sit down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got to eat something real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to pitch a few more
bowls and then we're going to welcome the
[SPEAKER_09]: West Coast Concentrate crew in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in the building.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, guys, we're back with the West
Coast Concentrate partial crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got Adam and Brett in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you both.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on, guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having us, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you get to be on our first Puff
Wednesday in a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It happened so naturally and then it just
sort of petered out as we gained more
[SPEAKER_09]: interest in our own channels and producing
different shows and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Life got busy, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: People have asked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so busy, it's unreal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're crazy busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm crazy busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Busy's always good.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys are crazy busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are crazy busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just make it ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because of this crazy country we live
in.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we have three different
perspectives here, and I'll say three
[SPEAKER_09]: different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm unique in the sense that I have all
three perspectives.
[SPEAKER_09]: But say I come from the perspective of the
idea of consulting for a licensed
[SPEAKER_09]: producer.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys are producing hash on a
dispensary level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: is a patient.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have a discussion about Justin
Trudeau and the federal government and how
[SPEAKER_09]: that's going to affect all three of those
platforms.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: Patient, local grassroots dispensary
industry, and of course, large scale
[SPEAKER_09]: licensed production facilities for
Canadian citizens.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the three things that,
of course, I think I speak for all of us
[SPEAKER_09]: when I say I welcome them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say as a patient,
that's exactly what I want to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see access.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see access from the local.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to shop within a hundred miles of
my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I support local economy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to support my farmer or my
friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want access to run a health
hospital like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I go to a pharmacy and have access
granted in that way, or some way or a
[SPEAKER_06]: form, where I have the same standardized
cost over and over?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do I choose like I choose?
[SPEAKER_06]: I grow my own.
[SPEAKER_06]: I make my own medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's grown medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's grown game medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you yourself know how much time and
energy that takes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not working.
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about the other patients out there
in the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need to be able to have your own
license.
[SPEAKER_09]: From a patient's perspective, there's
John's perspective right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no license.
[SPEAKER_09]: He absolutely requires to be able to grow
his own, but on the side note,
[SPEAKER_09]: he loves the idea of having it available
both through dispensaries as well as
[SPEAKER_09]: through licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or no license.
[SPEAKER_05]: If every way to start growing thyme or
basil in your backyard, you want to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: it, by all means.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's going to be some kind of
playing ground or some kind of maximum
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like everything that we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: People grow tomatoes in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: People grow tomatoes in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can also buy them from King's
Market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can get them from the big buying
company where they have big warehouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's going to have all different
types of platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the best thing about it is,
hey, he said he's going to give a
[SPEAKER_06]: legalized campus in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's going to do that for the
recreational, the medicinal, for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Preventative, industrial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's how the job can be readily
available to the communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are they going to be accessed?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then how are we going to be able to
stay in this industry that we all love and
[SPEAKER_06]: are passionate about every day?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an exciting time, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's so many people that,
I mean, I don't know how recently we did
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a lot of people that aren't
coming back here for that reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, we're going to see every end of
it now, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also see the churches to be
certainly there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big money involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's big money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's my one worry when Adam says,
or maybe no license, in a perfect world.
[SPEAKER_09]: There would be no licensing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can tell that the profits that
will be produced will be on scale with the
[SPEAKER_09]: smartphone revolution.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no way that in some way,
shape, or form, big business, government,
[SPEAKER_09]: grassroots business, everyone's going to
want to get their hands into that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd really like to see patients being able
to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see LPs being able to sell
resin that's extracted.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd really like, I'm for all of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want it to all be a goal.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want everybody to be able to grow their
own, to extract their own resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't want to do that,
you can come to a store.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or an LP and buy your extracted resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the best part about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We as in, like myself, wherever we get
able to go and no one can ever access it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't access it while we're sitting
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't exist in any of the clubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, in the street, there is just
no access to this type of medication.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we understand that we need the
access.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the access is more branched.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the big LPs, how much production?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe because people are so, you know the
yields we get from our extractions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea personally of being able
to see the positive effects of the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis industry in life.
[SPEAKER_09]: What Bruce Lipton said in the CBC this
morning, I read a quote from him saying
[SPEAKER_09]: that when we see the airports that this
tax builds and when we see the bridges and
[SPEAKER_09]: the infrastructure that comes out,
that will be the most powerful thing that
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis legalization in Canada will show,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just stopped making criminals out of
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel like a criminal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really felt like a criminal.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to catch up with you guys in a
bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just bumped into Chris Bennett here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to just stop real quick on
this puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to have a puff up there,
but we'll just film it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I got it, I kind of was like,
what is this weird plastic grinder thing?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when I saw, because here's the
thing about Storrs and Bickel.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the mighty vaporizer here.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys kind of don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to like efficiency,
they're German, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, I saw the little plastic
grinder.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, I'm not really sure I'd ever
use this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when I saw how it fit into the
unit, I was like, that's some smart shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you don't open it upside down.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I've done a stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I did it the first time,
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to ask you quickly about your
feelings in regards to Harper being gone
[SPEAKER_09]: and Trudeau being in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think I'm so stoked to see Harper
gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was a possibility he still
might hold in, because he has such a solid
[SPEAKER_04]: base.
[SPEAKER_04]: But pretty clear that all the new voters
out there picked up the torch and got him
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trudeau, I had been pretty staunch Trudeau
supporter up until he supported Bill C-51.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was hard for me to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would have been better with
maybe a little bit more NDP influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Justin's a bad guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he made a mistake on C-51.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got bad advice, pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a hard call on the Canadian
public.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reality is, when you're a politician
at that level, if you don't make some
[SPEAKER_04]: personal compromises in your worldview,
then you're probably not going to get to
[SPEAKER_04]: be prime minister of this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was disappointed in the C-51 talk and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think he's a decent human being.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even see him in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: He seemed like he had a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's spent a lot of time here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he's honest about
legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm worried that under the libs it might
be a little bit too corporate for most
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would have liked to have seen the
NDP there for that, to make sure of a
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller business and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_09]: He seemed to be supportive of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said the personal growing comments,
compared to brewing your own beer when he
[SPEAKER_04]: was talking about medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that pulls through for things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we have some sort of model close to
what we have for liquor with restaurants
[SPEAKER_04]: and things like that, having some liquor
licenses and craft beer and cottage wine
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, as well as the big things,
then that would probably keep most people
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you what, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at Oregon, when I was just down
there on the weekend in Portland,
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization just looked so fabulous.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: To see billboards with cannabis gummy
bears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Opening of new dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then picking up newspapers,
the Georgia Straits style newspapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more than half the advertising is all
cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to think about how this affects
the economy overall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking pizza sales.
[SPEAKER_09]: It always has affected the economy
overall.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just in this sort of underground
that it was squeezing into the economy in
[SPEAKER_09]: places that people couldn't really see
clearly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think now that it's lifted up out of
those sort of shadows, that we'll be able
[SPEAKER_09]: to see that very thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was talking about it earlier when
airports and infrastructure and all these
[SPEAKER_09]: things start actually getting produced
here in Canada from taxes that were paid
[SPEAKER_09]: on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be a huge boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado's already making a hundred
million bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mighty is such a good vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That tasted delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up putting my volcano in the
closet and now I'm just using the Mighty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much cleaner, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of flavor you got there?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Rene-esque, almost has some berry
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hash plant 13, huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I just wanted to stop and have a
quick talk with Chris Bennett.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to continue on our way to the
next place for Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Skate again one of these days,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never stop asking us, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt Fryk is in the range.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's good.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we've made it to a nice
little park here in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this, English Bay?
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: English Bay right here to the side of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stanley Park West.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ocean galore and we're probably going to
make our way a little closer but we just
[SPEAKER_09]: figured we would stop in a bunch of cool
spots and have a rib.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is basically the entrance to
Stanley Park.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're right behind the fish house if
you've ever want to come check out this
[SPEAKER_09]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows, we might check it out later
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you take that rib.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got about 25 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what, just so you guys know,
yes, I forgot something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We forgot the OFC.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make it work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making it work.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, there it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's working right there, John.
[SPEAKER_09]: A solid 30 second wait on the dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Walking through the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: With this new platform and the new ice
field.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this smile.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Heading down here to the water.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is called Second Beach.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, this has to be like the
smallest beach ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great little spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about to have a nice little session
right here on this big tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this one over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just cheating by living here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go have a couple of seats up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, guys, so we are at Second Beach
here in Vancouver, sitting by all these
[SPEAKER_09]: ships that are just sitting in the port or
waiting to maybe gain access to the port.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys know the area better than me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where the fireworks happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that much.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we just figured we'd set up a
little session here on the beach.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure if you guys can see, but there
are a couple of cops on horses way in the
[SPEAKER_09]: background on the beach.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're hoping that they're going to
just continue along their way and come
[SPEAKER_09]: right by us here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be able to maybe ask them a
couple of questions on how they see the
[SPEAKER_09]: changing of the government's affecting the
policy that Canada has on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: Versus the prohibition of it should be a
good question to ask them if they come
[SPEAKER_09]: around.
[SPEAKER_09]: See what they think of Trudeau.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, let's smoke ourselves
silly on a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nothing like being able to come into
Vancouver on such a lovely day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the beautiful boathouse in the
background, I've eaten there so much with
[SPEAKER_06]: you, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it's a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we puffed over there and now we're
puffing over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And soon we'll be puffing over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puffs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puffs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Telling you straight up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, glad John brought the ball rig
out with the torch and the quartz honey
[SPEAKER_09]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice to be able to be out here and
just ripping dabs with the amigos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cracking dabs off of that rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: No turps added.
[SPEAKER_05]: No turps added.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very stable, might I add.
[SPEAKER_05]: No turps added.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful casing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extremely stable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they are now on the sidewalk and I'd
say they'll probably be here within three
[SPEAKER_09]: or four minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we made it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to, at one point in time,
put the pipe away and just kind of see if
[SPEAKER_09]: they want to do a quick little interview
when they come up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more rip?
[SPEAKER_09]: One more ripper for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take a rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll trade you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take a ripper.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just open the case and put the rosin back
inside the lid where I had it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Timer here for you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to be careful with the timer,
too, when you're outside by the water and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's blowing a nice wind.
[SPEAKER_09]: You might not want to wait the full 45
seconds that you're used to waiting,
[SPEAKER_09]: but wait a little bit less because it does
cool it down a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we doing for proximity?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always quite nice to be able to just
sit back in and talk more about what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all really lucky to be where we are
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect to be able to sit here and really
feel no worries.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's see what the police have to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny, you got off and rolled that baby
back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Off Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it looks like we didn't get to ask
the police our question.
[SPEAKER_10]: They seem to be in hot pursuit of... Oh,
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next time, I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: They always go up my street.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: Must just be the track.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I guess it's time for us to find
another spot to puff, and that's what
[SPEAKER_09]: we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're taking us to our next puff spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Brett's leading the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is fall in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spring is gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Summer is gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Winter is soon to return.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are deep in the throes of fall.
[SPEAKER_10]: Little squirrel dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, little dude?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's small.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so we have made it here to the
apartment overlooking Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess this is the West End.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got Stanley Park right in the back
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice beautiful trees as far as the eye can
see.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got another little bit of shot of
Stanley Park through here, the little lake
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then some beautiful fall colors.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_02]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: These fall colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, he just pulled this out,
and I was like, you gotta get in on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some, that's some, that's some,
that's some southern style right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to have two screens though,
those holes are too big.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can get you some screens that are much
tighter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I had to.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the mothership?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just coming up on 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make her an eight reddit rip there,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gonna be a long one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let her melt quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little shaky
[SPEAKER_00]: shimmering.
[SPEAKER_10]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so we just got to Cardero's.
[SPEAKER_09]: After a lot of Puff Wednesdaying,
we like to eat some delicious food.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is one of the great places in
downtown Vancouver, and we're gonna take
[SPEAKER_09]: you in right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right in the marina here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really sweet.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm, uh, you know what, I'm good
wherever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we are at Cardero's.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we doing, boys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just ordered up some goodness,
didn't we?
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting some walk goodness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little bread, little bread, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Little carbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the yachts outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is gonna be good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's the remnants of our salad.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we have left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys still haven't eaten,
can you tell?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hangry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hypoglycemic?
Hangry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you hangry?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hangry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that camera out of my face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, food has arrived, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got going on there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the Harbor Burger with some bacon on
it and all the good- Johnny B.'s looks
[SPEAKER_07]: like he's going healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a halibut.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of halibut?
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you got going on there?
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the Cedar Plank.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the Cedar Plank, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks friggin' good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got the steak?
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got the salmon burger.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Shamal Burger.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are going to eat, and then we will
puff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just whistling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_09]: So where to now, guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking we might need a bit of sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost a few.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need no stinking sun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the sun is gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gone already.
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, careful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeez, don't get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, go over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow her.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been down here before.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have, but I just can't remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here we are now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Puff Wednesday, and we're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're always trying to- I always say we
have to do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always need to make it different.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing we don't do is walk along the
seawall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the first.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done it on, just with Chris Bennett
on his Boosted Boards, but never actually
[SPEAKER_09]: just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Seven Sails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at the birds.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice and deep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going down that little epic spot right
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a nice place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too shabby, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Port of Vancouver lookout.
[SPEAKER_09]: Celebrating the centennial of Stanley
Park.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice little spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got a nice 270 degree under the seawall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yearning up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a mothership you have there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I happen to have a mothership.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_09]: This sounds good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a dabber?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this little dabbing tool from
somebody, and I keep it in my box.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read here all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in memory of Violet RG, her favorite
walk in all seasons, from the Golden Bowl
[SPEAKER_06]: to the Pointeville, 1994 and 1919.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: In memory of Violet, I'm going to Puff
Bullfair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, gentlemen, we've made it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We finished Carderos.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did some puffing at the apartment.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did some puffing by the ocean.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did some puffing in the park under the
trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puffed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did some puffing at the vapor lounge.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we are at Stanley Park.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are very close to the infamous
lighthouse where a lot of people come and
[SPEAKER_09]: pull up their cars and have a puff while
staring at West and North Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Seagull?
[SPEAKER_09]: Got you, boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, we've got the city in the
background.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven sails.
[SPEAKER_09]: The fluorescent lights of Vancouver are
starting to light up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shawtown.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: One big dab each, and we're going to call
this a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then these guys are going to head down
to the CCHQ on Davie, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: hold their West Coast Concentrate Full
Melt Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_09]: West Coast Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_09]: West Coast Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can check these guys out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: West Coast Melts.
[SPEAKER_05]: West Coast Connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can follow the West Coast
Collective for any dropouts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're making or new products coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: No E on the end of Collective,
though.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Johnny B is Weedmaster420,
and of course, IMBCBubbleman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check us all out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the meantime, we're just going to
finish up these last few dabs of the
[SPEAKER_09]: evening.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a wonderful, beautiful evening.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of ocean, nice and calm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Helicopters and planes leaving every five
or ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Sea Fairy is going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful out here at night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of wish I was coming to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I came into town because there was talk of
hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I needed to get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't done a Puff Wednesday,
and it's always a good reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what the reason was?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just because for you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's neat that these people running by
right now, they're joggers.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were looking at us like, what the
hell are they doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was looking at them with the same
look.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_06]: They were changing dopamine so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole different TAC house.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just working a little harder.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that heating up?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually heating.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you need a dab on there?
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference is we talk about the body's
own TAC.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to talk louder.
[SPEAKER_06]: They won't hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The body's own TAC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Runners high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're running, you have to use
grease.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get one?
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody over here on the seawall who
are running or puffing are all doing the
[SPEAKER_06]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to get here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, here you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosin wrapped it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bubble wrapped in rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bubble flag.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just had a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I'm the guy that gets to get the fist
hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: No water in the ball ring.
[SPEAKER_06]: No water in the ball ring?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're surrounded by water.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's finish it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got about two minutes of video time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see that my battery has turned red
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just in case this does cut out.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Happy Puff Wednesday, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you were doing there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you were doing there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were in a white of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was still too hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: He hit that hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a legit hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so legit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was too legit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not too legit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like some 1990 shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the too-legit-to-quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, the dry pipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Such a nice piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I probably should have gone
and put a little salt water in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there was a weird water not
suitable for swimming sign.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I figured if it's not suitable for
swimming, we probably shouldn't filter
[SPEAKER_09]: things through our lungs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: See all those big tankerships and the
major port?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Vancouver's right there, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got one more dab coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, is it you or Marcus?
[SPEAKER_09]: He's having them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm aware.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this your time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you avoid the no water way too hot in?
[SPEAKER_11]: No water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you also heating it up to red?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it red when you heated it up?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hash and we're right now orange.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell us.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sure got to be careful carving this
bowl with this fucking card.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't suggest you do that at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a wrap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, we bring another one to you
guys very soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can already hear the Bubble Man theme
music going on in the background.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see the person on the side of the ship
where the opening is?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a person on the ramp at the bottom
in red.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that guy, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's literally climbing out of that ship
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trippy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like right out of Mad Max.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, if you were on a boat,
you would even feel a more humility,
[SPEAKER_08]: a more humble sort of like.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 10 stories tall, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the least, it's trippy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially because think of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of how close you are to here where
your bed is.
[SPEAKER_09]: That thing is bigger than the building you
live in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, can you imagine what it would look
like going underneath the bridge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there is a bridge.
