[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to... Toronto?
[SPEAKER_06]: Toronto Pearson International Airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're sorry we didn't film a little
session early this morning at 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: out in front of the Vancouver Airport,
but it got so busy and things got hectic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what we decided to do was start our
session outside here at the airport,
[SPEAKER_06]: which we've done before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, three years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Champs, maybe?
[SPEAKER_06]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_06]: Treating yourself one of those... T.Y.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beaker bong bong rims.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we've got a couple of people picking
us up, but they might not be camera
[SPEAKER_06]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what we figured we would do is just go
out and have our own little session as we
[SPEAKER_06]: get to the outside of the airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I mean, I bought some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Johnny brought some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought some rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought a little bit of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've got a torch waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a... Hey, let's take the caution
and attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: This should be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoelace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Life is good in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually warmer here than it was in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, make sure the jacket doesn't get
caught up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess we're just going to walk
through the airport, so we'll see you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: when we see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we go right out this exit?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get searched at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no searching.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just...
[SPEAKER_03]: puffing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puffing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just puffing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's self-contained.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the streets.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did a hundred alarms on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you got the good security.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so I guess it's time to have a
little session here in the smoking area.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure how receptive people are
going to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the police right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, at an airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at the airport, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the mother ship.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what I got, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the cops right behind you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw how bad I was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get John a nice big rip
here while we're at the Pearson
[SPEAKER_06]: International Airport, Toronto.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puffing on some beautiful rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some terpenes, so let's get this show
on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are definitely getting the show on the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so you got the terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take off the cap here and put
that right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Stardog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very happy about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a little bit of rosin here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stardog?
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love how you have the setup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've puffed here in the past,
like we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much, you know what, this is what
we call legal recreational cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't make sure that we were in the
smoking section.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we go over to the farthest end of
where they smoke the cigarettes and try
[SPEAKER_06]: not to bug anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just doing our own thing and doing a
little terp dip with the Stardog here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a dabber for you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are taking waterless bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the dry hit because you get the
full flavour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the airport, I really don't want to
use water from the bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to time it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's better when I time it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to time your banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've already wrecked mine when we
talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to chazz your banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't want to chazz your banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't chazz your banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get excited sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So timing it, getting your Q-tip on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding that epic dab that you need
for the terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cleaning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget you need the cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need the cleaning solution,
which we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's in my bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did it get put?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the cleaning solution?
[SPEAKER_06]: You said I put it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in a bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that in that bag?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, oh, that was in this bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not in that bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to have a quick check real
quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I have it because we can't hit off
this banger without that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all my cleaning solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's hope we find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell me when to hit the start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit start.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be great if this wasn't all there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best part about this, guys,
is really is the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving it that second to make sure
everything is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a look at how everything's going to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure he's got... Now you got to
check out this bag that they gave him at
[SPEAKER_00]: the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they gave me this bag for my
liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave you this little bag to put your
terpenes in at the airport so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: carry them on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my terp sack.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's placed liquids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have my cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought the bond cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to make sure we brought the bond
cleaner with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is major important.
[SPEAKER_06]: This might be getting a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dip it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't move it around too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put it in and hold it just because
you can tuck up the base of the pipe
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little bit of a carving in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabs at the airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite things to do for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Toasted it up nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how that cleaner works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so amazed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so amazed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might not help with a brother by holding a
little extra support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I torched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to clean that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, good job,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an amazing flavor, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the rosin in my pocket, so I'll have
to actually heat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, no, it's in my inside pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not digging into the inside pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm sitting here watching security
staring at us right there, I give them a
[SPEAKER_00]: thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can so much tell you how much better my
back feels from that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not allowed to dab on the plane,
so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we were thinking about the granola
bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were going to eat 100 milligrams of
granola bar each.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_06]: That did pass our minds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for whatever reason, we just decided
against it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We figured tomorrow would be a better day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do it still, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're definitely going to eat that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tab it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that rosin out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to put that right there for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely going to move this over a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the cap is really well and
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting ready to do some amazing
things.
Cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, one second here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to get this dab happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did those turps go, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_06]: Turps go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's no turps on the table
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I put them in my pocket or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have much time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: 38 turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get dipped.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going sun shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to double dip them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm going Sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this is what a brother does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets the cap ready to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a job well done.
[SPEAKER_06]: A job well done, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: We managed to have a nice session.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a little bit of security behind
it, really, really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: You feel safe?
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important to feel safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's call it a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to head to our hotel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is Puff Wednesday, so we are Puff
Wednesday-ing all day long, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait till you see me.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's clean this banger real
quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So John and I are fairly baked now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm well medicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised we ended up back in the
airport, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall we walk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing was, if we get to Toronto,
what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going on a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys ever thought we would just be
coming here and jumping on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Transit?
[SPEAKER_06]: The ride that was picking us up ended up
at the wrong terminal.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a huge airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say the wrong terminal,
I mean like he's several kilometers away,
[SPEAKER_06]: or like a mile away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Far enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're actually going to get on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a really cool little system here
with a monorail.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get on this little train.
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs every like eight minutes or
something, and it's going to take us there
[SPEAKER_06]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the train.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so now we're on the train.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heading to the next terminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the train?
[SPEAKER_06]: The train was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gave me an idea, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gave me an idea, John, for us to
potentially invite some people to meet us
[SPEAKER_06]: tomorrow for late night session at the
Vape Lounge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we get this video up early
enough tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd like to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be a good opportunity for us,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're outside again, and it's loud
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're still waiting for our friend to
arrive in his vehicle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep you posted.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we are getting closer to our
ride.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is 33.
[SPEAKER_06]: But is he downstairs or upstairs?
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be downstairs, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can promise you.
[SPEAKER_06]: 150.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we're back in the airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going down another escalator.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we went to, I guess, departures.
[SPEAKER_06]: 33 departures.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bet you when we come down here,
John, it'll be like, three will be the
[SPEAKER_06]: number on the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll have to walk to 33.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think our friend's here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to find out if he wants to be
filmed, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may or may not get to see him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's going to be OK with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We made it to the airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kirk's in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good to see you finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first very, very, very virgin first
time to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess who's driving?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: I already knew that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I already knew that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And listen, I wanted to bring the
California Hawaiian with me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You bought some California Hawaiian?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_06]: John's like, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot warmer than Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vancouver, well, look at me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wearing like a winter coat,
thinking it was going to be freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to go check into a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been po-poing some goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: More excitement coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to it, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, did we get lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got to the hotel here at the West
End.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing our thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the car here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a couple of po-pos here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably heard that we're going to be
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys like to follow us around
everywhere we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you want to have a session,
Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big, fat cop car session?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good that they're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if the door's open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cop car session.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't mind it, Kirk?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: John and I are just going to go have a
session inside that cop car.
[SPEAKER_08]: Inside of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: The doors are open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's grab our stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B and I are here at the West End,
the SPG Gold and Platinum member.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jay's helping us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jay's huffing us.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on Puff Wednesday and doesn't even
know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your first Puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the thing we do for our YouTube
channel.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all checked in here at the West End.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B's just checking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll get checked in and meet me up at my
room in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a little session.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of little camera clips of
the travels, but it's always fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I figured I'd share some of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: In we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the elevator.
[SPEAKER_02]: On to the 14th floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Staying on the 14th floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Elevator doors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Move well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got really nicely medicated at the airport
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was inspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I forgot all my stuff basically
the whole time we were walking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like feeling for my phone,
trying to remember what I did with the
[SPEAKER_06]: mothership.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everything I thought was lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys can re-watch that,
you might notice that I looked a little
[SPEAKER_06]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1407.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right near the elevator.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like pretty much the worst place you could
put me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they'll figure that out soon enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little one bedroom here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much not even like a little office suite.
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much to look at outside, but that's
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well show you guys anyway,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they got the clothes on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't even let you open your door.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a special thing that closes
the balcony off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to make for difficult
puffing, but not impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're heading back down to Johnny B's.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is on the 12th floor, two floors below.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have a little session with
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another cool elevator door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sandals, shoes, and a hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool if one was like a fat mother
ship with like a blinged out bucket on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some beautiful rosin dry-septum bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Johnny B, I believe he said 1214.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go check it out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, you know, I was just like holding some
sift and grabbing my pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, sift and grabbing your pipe?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is bigger than my room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I came up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got one extra chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra chairs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that couple of these beautiful sifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when I opened up the sifts,
I was like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I figured if we were going
to come to Toronto, and because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: carry a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a terrible light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to just try to open this a bit.
Where's Kurt?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just messaged him that he's in the 9th
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so we got some sifties.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, you know, I did some screening
this morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just cleaned.
[SPEAKER_08]: No static clean or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a nice cleaning on the screens for
about an hour and a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like an eight-hour clean,
but it's melty, and it's quick sift.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick sift, it took an hour and 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we unveiling the pipe?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you haven't seen the pipe,
have you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unveiling the pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unveiling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and then what you noticed there last
time was, of course, I brought the
[SPEAKER_08]: mothership bowl to put it all in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wouldn't be the same if it didn't
bring clean screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean screen, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice, Johnny, very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait for you to hit this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, I can't wait to hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to try to squeeze out of your
balcony here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a funny moment there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just pulled this out of the base of
John's door here, and now we can go
[SPEAKER_06]: outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we can go outside, go outside,
go outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: But why?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're adults, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yours was out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was stoker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yours was open.
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me smile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just made me laugh so hard that I got
things locked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your room is the room we're hanging out
the whole time, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got the spot, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is proper Johnny B spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a little bit of rain going on out
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for a sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: So John's trying to send his partner Kirk
a message to tell him that we've got a
[SPEAKER_06]: restaurant in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he does his voice dictation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're booking a place for eating at 530.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a restaurant in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's full of all kinds of good sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said wagyu beef.
[SPEAKER_06]: It turned into all kinds of good sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: The wagyu beef apparently is all kinds of
good sex.
[SPEAKER_08]: For those that, yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: To Google.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got a couple of Flaves of Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B's got some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got his new piece here, which we are
about to maybe do some dipping in.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean maybe?
[SPEAKER_06]: As Johnny B would do after a good rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty much going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love how they have two beds in here
and one chair.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could bring mine down.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I could sit on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, you take this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the back thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the back thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got no back thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start eating well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the way we have to start that,
oh yeah, my laptop's in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to remember as I was about to throw
my bag on the floor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we got a banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know one thing I didn't bring?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't bring a banger because I
didn't have a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got no banger?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you got a banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the first thing you do when you
come into the hotel room?
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a door between mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B's going to cover the... OK,
so here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's see if we can fit this banger on
Johnny B's pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tight little banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got that lemon drop on Johnny B's pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_08]: That does look pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually matches.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the perfect new home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll sell it to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll gladly buy that off you.
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 grams?
[SPEAKER_06]: 2,500 US.
[SPEAKER_06]: US?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be willing to trade you with a
little bit of sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Half a gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't feel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the trades that we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see how I got a little bit lazier
with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that one looks a little lazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just here at the Westin hotel
room, Johnny B's room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been chatting up a whole storm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to kind of hit the record button.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK, because we've been laughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've been laughing for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been some funny shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got my turp dip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try Johnny B's new pipe that
I have yet to try.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll trade you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a recycler, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just learned about the reverse.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitting your piece, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so stoked to hit your piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's such a beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how much you would admire it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm even going to blow my rip out your
door, just so we don't set off the alarm
[SPEAKER_06]: and get kicked out of the hotel within
being here for an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably couldn't really wrap your
head around how many times that's
[SPEAKER_06]: happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can tell you it has happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a continental hotel, we've asked your
dad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever do Barcelona at that one
place?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got kicked out of a place in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in the hospitalette.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got kickied right out.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we're here almost at the 55
second mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never to hit it too early, or you will get
that crispy banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell you, I don't want to chas my
banger as Brett Maverick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Johnny B's chas'd out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not completely chas'd.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get excited sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I'm really excited about is,
I love that carpet cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm admiring it because I've been
only hitting it, but to actually watch a
[SPEAKER_08]: nice rip come out of that pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I liked about it was that it was
fulfilling in the sense that I finished
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never finish rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: They always like smoke and kind of
continue to go on and on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that really was... It's a beautiful
hanging there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a perfect one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see it when you put the cap on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it just filled right up with white
smoke and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, poof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like really full of seed,
which you guys got to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really got a chance to really
get to see the pipe getting hit,
[SPEAKER_08]: because of course, I've only done a few
hits on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like my... It's your special
pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my very special pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your special pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more special than any other pipes
I've had.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a special.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Dan hooked it up in Helena.
[SPEAKER_07]: She made everything happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an awesome, awesome gift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the chazzed out banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go a full minute on that
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because we heated this up real good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a turp dip.
[SPEAKER_07]: What turp dip are we dipping?
[SPEAKER_06]: A Starduck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's real nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cured out and it has created this
whole other thing that was not going on
[SPEAKER_06]: when I first got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, like honestly... See how
that hits you though?
[SPEAKER_08]: When people understand what a turp is,
like when that hit my nostrils.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of like an ease through the
eyes through here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm just... I got this stuff
going on over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I have to say hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... One minute?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say you're good to go, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just push that in there and hold it down
and it'll all fall off that nail and then
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll carve you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it did do exactly what John said,
exactly what it does when you carve a
[SPEAKER_06]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, which was interesting because
when I carved the pipe hitting it just
[SPEAKER_06]: with, you know, making it percolate
without an actual rip, it really felt like
[SPEAKER_06]: there was no change whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of freaked me out a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: There wasn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: There wasn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no change after putting the
carve on, like you said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, just kind of went right in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a Puff Wednesday and it's a Puff
Wednesday Toronto style.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though we're kind of... Have you
shown them the view?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're kind of outside of Toronto right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like, it's right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this is still considered Toronto.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the city at?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to think... On the other side?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's behind us.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's behind us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so there it's on the other side of
the building is the city, but... And this
[SPEAKER_06]: camera does a pretty good job in low
light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, it's dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: 14-4.
[SPEAKER_06]: 14-4 with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: 14-4.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until the next session, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll film some of the food.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Johnny B and I are still going
here hard with Zach.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so how was that dry sip,
dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty amazing, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's pretty melty too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's pretty good, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blowing it out so we don't get kicked out
of the hotel and arrested or... Is that
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're trying to avoid, John?
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the smart thing to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just vapor.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when are we smart?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we medicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think I'm gonna have one of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it this one over here?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's this one right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw a little hoot in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just carving it out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said how much you hate parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, don't put your dry sift in parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: It crackles and pops and sends dry sift
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does, but I was like in a panic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: The parchment and dry sift ratio used to
do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to drive me nuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this like a new screen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll take the old screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll hit the old screen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I think I'm like hooking up
a brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were just discussing how sift
became such a big part of my life
[SPEAKER_08]: because...
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, see, I love it how this stays on the
card.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was the first time he gave me the
wicked sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see if we can kind of get
into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a little too tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we good?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, hitting with a lighter.
[SPEAKER_06]: No beeline, no match.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do this.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like your new pipe, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably something like, you know,
it's an epic handy piece that I love
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's, well, A for one,
you know, it's a glass blower with a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of years behind its belt and he
knows what he's doing and he's producing
[SPEAKER_08]: some pretty epic art.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what that is, glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little bit of art too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right out the window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puff Wednesday, I'm still going strong
with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Zach.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so it's almost midnight here on
a puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B and I, we haven't skipped a
fucking beat.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're onto the New York style.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheesecake with the cherry compote.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like a fork and a spoon or a
spoon and a fork?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is going to be pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to have one more good
session before we call it a day here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been great hanging out with you guys
in Toronto and it's time to eat some
[SPEAKER_06]: cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_06]: You eat that Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Johnny B over there eating his
cheesecake and I guess it's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: nearing the end of a puff Wednesday here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been at it all day long and we're
just going to finish it off with one last
[SPEAKER_05]: little puff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much puffed that rosin pack out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That rosin's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice base for the turp dipping,
I really find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite nice indeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well let's make that happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jean B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jean B.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some turpines, eh?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want some turpines?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some star dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: A little turpine for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
Yummy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you glad I woke you up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I wasn't really sleeping yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just kind of like... Are you glad I
got you out of bed?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it's not like really that late
because I'm like not on their time this
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like eight o'clock for us right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is definitely... All right,
well we got a nice turp dip of the MK
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultra dipped into the star dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got that shit going down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got it going down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh is this one yours or mine?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just timing the phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard a lot of the Johnny B going on
here and they just turp dipping for me and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff like that so I thought I should
maybe stand up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering you're so much more of a
taller guy, I was quite surprised on how
[SPEAKER_04]: high the seat was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm like slouched into the sucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like really low down, like eight
inches below where your seat is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your torso is about six inches taller
than mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you've had the vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could be... Potentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to go on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't heat it up like normal if you
want to hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll carve you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll carve you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just blew it into the corner there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: How was that JB?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get our precision Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some like sideways thing going on
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like these right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get way in nicer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't have the cheesecake without
you, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just feeling like, well,
just give him a call.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ring the local number right by the bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is literally how the conversation
went.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B, you can't go to bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's cheesecake for us to consume.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, let me get you in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I was slouching.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm getting down too now to kind of
get slouchy with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the last Puff and Puff Wednesday
today, this particular day of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool being at the airport,
making a little flight, coming to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be able to maybe talk about this
trip a little more in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an exciting trip for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having good experiences,
meeting good people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey, what more can you really ask for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B's off to Mexico in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm off to Jamaica, so I'm sure you'll get
some videos from both those places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although maybe not from Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on vacation.
[SPEAKER_06]: He might not be making many videos while
he's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got to make a video in Tulum though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be some adventures coming soon
from an ongoing vacation that might
[SPEAKER_07]: happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, keeping that thing clean is
important.
[SPEAKER_06]: It surely is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to hit that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already got this going.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned in order to get this done
properly, this is what you have to do,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Time it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't count.
[SPEAKER_07]: You forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the walks in, something happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this, you can't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, unless you overheat the nail compared
to what your timer is used to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's just like, if in doubt,
wait three more seconds.
[SPEAKER_08]: The worst you can do is not wreck your
banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, the simple test, which is what
people have been using since people
[SPEAKER_06]: started doing this, is the hand,
the wrist, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretty good method.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wrist especially feels the sensitivity
of the heat very strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sizzle on the wrist anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I don't think I'll hit this at 55
seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'll still be too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go for like a minute,
15 seconds or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: See?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's always a different kind of elbow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on how much you torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you torch the nail for long,
like lately I've been torching it,
