[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up guys morning here with the
great gardener about to do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: a I guess a morning sesh, but a not quite
wake and bake sesh We've already had food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already baked a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 230.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the ceramic insert Cleaned very
nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found out that the torch definitely
does Clean the ceramic better than trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to scrape it with a skillet tool Afghani
You can go closer with that one,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll actually focus That one's the
Barbara Bud 73 Such a nice color and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor on that Barbara Heyoma 120
Beautiful what's to start with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Heyoma you just said Heyoma Oh,
I can't yeah, man, but this is oh this
[SPEAKER_01]: one's an Afghani Heyoma dry sift We made
yesterday That's the one That's a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it Let's drop that on the
ceramic Give them the view
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice taste
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna hit You going for I think I'm
gonna hit the bar 45 bar nice difference
[SPEAKER_01]: in the colors I just want to show them
real quick the bar you can tell that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a difference in terpenes right
there one is Almost a reddish color this
[SPEAKER_01]: one Here this one has much more of a
blonde color to it And this is the 45 the
[SPEAKER_01]: reddish darker one and the more I wouldn't
say reddish But almost the orange is tinge
[SPEAKER_01]: to it compared to the more blonde For sure
there you go Pretty stoked on this little
[SPEAKER_01]: ceramic insert that D Nell sent me now
that we've actually figured out torching
[SPEAKER_01]: it and getting it Getting it properly
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a pretty pretty neat little unit
Just paint the melt right onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just Bubbles quite lovely Nice safe
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as tippy as you think hey I Find
it was the right angle you hit it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: side Exactly I find when I touch it I I'm
more inclined to touch it in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: almost than on the edge on the edge It
tends to do its little I'm sure the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: will figure it out This was originally
designed to insert into the titanium nail
[SPEAKER_01]: my titanium nail that I have was a special
nail that they ground down and the walls
[SPEAKER_01]: were a little thicker So it didn't fit
into it So I figured if it sits on the tie
[SPEAKER_01]: now like that it could sit on the quartz
nail like that So they were surprised they
[SPEAKER_01]: had no intentions of using it with a
quartz nail, but I'll tell you I have
[SPEAKER_01]: every intention of using it with a quartz
now Anybody else
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do one more on camera When you gonna
hit I think I'm gonna hit this Barbara 120
[SPEAKER_01]: The light have you seen the lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can just paint that on
there Lost it they're heated up first
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's best to heat the dabber up
just a tiny little bit on the nail or on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ceramic Literally pick up a nice big
rock Paint that on there
[SPEAKER_01]: That was delicious We're gonna continue to
do much of this and we'll get back to some
[SPEAKER_01]: hash making probably in the near future
More importantly some some interviews with
[SPEAKER_01]: the great gardener about just how he runs
the garden A little bit of the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: help them and just sort of an all-around
You know, I know a lot of you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get to some of those questions as
well All right You You You You You
