[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny HB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Marcus Marcus G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Williger or bubble man, whatever you want
to call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My last name is not really Williger So
today John you have brought beautiful most
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome treats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that this is somewhat of a full
circle particularly with this You know
[SPEAKER_02]: from going to visit Ron before that from
Ron getting the cut here at my house from
[SPEAKER_02]: higher end taking it to the Kootenays
having it there for multiple years before
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out filmed the episode with Ron
where I got the Astro Boy Watermelon Fino
[SPEAKER_02]: clones about four of them and then came
home on the plane gave them to John.
[SPEAKER_02]: John rooted them cut them gave me some
which I'm blooming right now we'll go see
[SPEAKER_02]: those later and John has finished some.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've already seen us run fresh frozen
and turn it into unbelievable quality
[SPEAKER_02]: melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude how do you even describe this
guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a bloody treat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was telling Mark in the past of
what he was doing to my room so understand
[SPEAKER_05]: we did the fresh frozen on Mark's birthday
so I took it down a week well that the day
[SPEAKER_05]: before on the 30th now this went for
another two and a half weeks and so this
[SPEAKER_05]: this has just turned on amazing this
literally has got to be some of the nicest
[SPEAKER_05]: tastiest we that I've ever grown as in not
being a kush from exotic it is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I can tell you from my perspective it
almost looks grapefruit esque this looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like what the grapefruit used to look like
back in the day and when I used to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis broker when I used to actually
broker cannabis this was the dream you
[SPEAKER_02]: could flip any amount of this in any
amount of time it was just it's perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: herb it's light colored very lime green
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh look at that bag this is this is 146
grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And did you not bounce some as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I did of course because when I cut this
and trimmed it up we got the first bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course John did it over the screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I always do.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I for what I do I did a rep then I
brought it over here because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: share what you shared with me my respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I'm ready to share.
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad high render wasn't here because I
mean that would be some serious respect
[SPEAKER_05]: giving him the first little rip of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well let's give you the first little rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well you know what I've tried it but not
on the D-nail so I'm really excited right
[SPEAKER_05]: now like that's what I was looking forward
to can't wait to get my D-nail can't wait
[SPEAKER_05]: to get it coming soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some gummy shit right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melts away into a beautiful liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I doubted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys want to maybe check out the
watermelon the Astro Boy both John and I
[SPEAKER_02]: are gonna be at the champs show in Toronto
next month May 23rd to 25th I believe and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna bring this bag yeah you're gonna
have that bag I'm gonna bring this bag
[SPEAKER_02]: might be short a few bucks but we'll have
all sorts of treats and it would be cool
[SPEAKER_02]: to invite you guys to the booth I think
we're in what is it 406 and 507 or what
[SPEAKER_02]: were the numbers?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll write it in the comments of what
booth number we are but definitely come
[SPEAKER_02]: check out our booths we're gonna be
sharing a rather large one and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping on doing a Puff Wednesday while
we're there and getting some of you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: on the show and definitely sharing sharing
some bowls of niceness with you so oh it's
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be definitely a nice event that
would be a nice treat last year we had a
[SPEAKER_02]: blast I didn't even give you one look at
me I'm just sitting here talking away
[SPEAKER_05]: enjoying this rip that I just did and
didn't offer my buddy a nice rip and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna show you some macro photos of
this because it really the first bounce
[SPEAKER_05]: like I always say the holy grail of hash
it's right there and it's not that much
[SPEAKER_05]: you know there's only about four or five
rips each out of the whole thing that I
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm not I'm not raping and I'm
just I'm just trimming it so of course the
[SPEAKER_02]: exhale and did you bounce this over your
140 or did you do the two screen trick
[SPEAKER_02]: with the 250 and the 180?
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually just did the regular no two
screen trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell because of the little black
dots in there yeah no it's just what you
[SPEAKER_02]: know how I do it it's still very pure
though I'll tell you that melts like crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: you should next time do your first bounce
on those two screens that's why I gave
[SPEAKER_05]: them to you just to do a light light
bounce but definitely we saw it at Matt's
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality of the resin that came out
just for that small small small it was 99%
[SPEAKER_02]: heads which I'd say this can't be too far
away oh my god does it ever grab you in
[SPEAKER_05]: the throat too it definitely melts very
nicely we're gonna be able to see that
[SPEAKER_05]: underneath those photos but by looking at
it little grains of sand yeah super blonde
[SPEAKER_05]: and beautiful that's the when I see that I
see grains of sand I know I'm happy
[SPEAKER_02]: because as you can see not that much yeah
it's not much but it's beautiful I'll give
[SPEAKER_02]: you a little close-up of it with the
camera it's yeah it's beautiful it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: first real full melt dry sift that I've
seen from the Astro Boy we've of course
[SPEAKER_02]: seen lots of full melt bubble fresh-frozen
was surreal like white and now the dry
[SPEAKER_05]: sift and another well I had to go you know
that was the whole idea is we want to take
[SPEAKER_02]: a really cool look at this whole plant the
Medi Kush is definitely no slouch this is
[SPEAKER_02]: some triple a right there I guess the kids
today would call it quads just completely
[SPEAKER_02]: coated in resin I'll also show you guys
this up close with the camera that's my
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine I have her in every every every
every month there's a few medis coming
[SPEAKER_05]: down this is really nice yeah I've been
really cushioned many to its limits lately
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been taking it like you know day 85
day 90 that's just just going crazy with
[SPEAKER_05]: it because it's doing it well because
there are no limits and that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of trying to show in when I'm doing
my grows that you don't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be super hung up on the flowering
periods just grow your plants for resin
[SPEAKER_02]: you grew resin so many people would have
cut that down way before months like it
[SPEAKER_02]: just keeps growing resin certain strains
will just keep producing trichomes and
[SPEAKER_02]: those are the strains you want to find and
those are the strains you want to grow I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean at least they are the ones I want to
find and I want to grow I guess I should
[SPEAKER_05]: repeat myself these two are definitely
full melt killer quality 100% we
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely have the two full melt
certified strains here which is well I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have any full melt of the of the
Medi Kush of the first balance because
[SPEAKER_02]: well it's my medicine so it's at home yeah
perfect awesome well maybe we'll take you
[SPEAKER_02]: down and show you a little bit of what's
going on in the other garden the little
[SPEAKER_02]: garden behind me of course is the Barb and
the Afghani from the great gardener as
[SPEAKER_05]: well as the sweet skunk and this one's
grown like I mean honestly this one's only
[SPEAKER_02]: grown literally maybe two to four inches
these ones are a couple inches these ones
[SPEAKER_02]: are maybe like three to four but these
Barb's have literally grown like a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: chunk and just giving them the Medi one
foliar spraying water on them they seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: really like that they've got one light fan
that blows across them it's a very simple
[SPEAKER_02]: little grow temperature 76 right now with
19% humidity I love cannabis why don't we
[SPEAKER_05]: go downstairs and check out those other
plants I would love to see your watermelon
[SPEAKER_05]: because I know it's looking like this but
it's still got a month ago all right let's
[SPEAKER_05]: go check it out I'm editing it so I can
just go this way
[SPEAKER_05]: you know I do all right guys we are down
in the garage and we're gonna go check out
[SPEAKER_02]: inside this tent so you want to open that
end John open this end nice motion John
[SPEAKER_02]: with a step back there we don't want to
get someone attacking you on your oh wow
[SPEAKER_02]: that smells amazing this guy was laying on
his side tipped over whoo man that does
[SPEAKER_02]: smell amazing right away why don't we
bring the camera we're gonna show you
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on in here all right so we're
coming in and so we've got bubba you see
[SPEAKER_04]: how it's rock-solid oh there we go there
we go I'm pretty sure that's lime green
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's nice resin producer so it's a
little stunted plant this particular one
[SPEAKER_02]: seemed to have gotten a little stunted
this one the Medi Kush which I mistakenly
[SPEAKER_02]: photographed yesterday as the bubba cam
I'll change that on Facebook this one has
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible trichome structure real kush
kush kushy it's the nugget that John has
[SPEAKER_02]: upstairs as well as this right next to it
is the other nugget that John has upstairs
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of cool hey the two of them
right next to each other these two buds
[SPEAKER_05]: here it was really cool as I did an
Instagram photo this morning of these two
[SPEAKER_05]: buds side-by-side I saw my face I liked it
and now we're seeing them together growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in your garden that is cool yeah this this
this astro boy is just stacking I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: impressed with the density and the smell
and the structure in general of this
[SPEAKER_02]: plants my little pony's getting a little
bit fatter I just took that strain till I
[SPEAKER_05]: flipped it to January 2nd couple more
astro boys over here they've been getting
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing but water for oh I'd say a week
plus now maybe even ten days yeah just the
[SPEAKER_02]: tips of the leaves are certainly oh oh
that's nice little little nugget right
[SPEAKER_03]: there identical to what I have upstairs
but why that's what's so nice of the
[SPEAKER_03]: structure when this bug dried it looked
the same as what it was growing look at
[SPEAKER_02]: that so there's that little garden it's
really you know that these plants look
[SPEAKER_02]: sparse in here because they were really
grown in a in a two by four foot tent in
[SPEAKER_02]: my office and now we're getting to a point
where these are gonna get refilled up in
[SPEAKER_02]: the next month or so with some fresh cuts
and every single plant is gonna be as
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful as that still got a freezer is
that not the best thing ever pizza lasagna
[SPEAKER_04]: and fresh frozen oh yeah so the many push
that's upstairs is right here frozen bless
[SPEAKER_06]: and sanctify almost I just keep on divine
order I made the words of iron I'm both
[SPEAKER_06]: and the meditation of iron I had be
acceptable in my sight I am I strength and
[SPEAKER_00]: Redeemer highly I'd say sure with this
colleague on my brain steaming sense in me
[SPEAKER_00]: most potent native straight absorption of
the essence freeze most every minute
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate then dehydrate then load it up
again and get taken up taken up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: celestial sweetest high that you could
never find vapor soaking me of the holy
[SPEAKER_00]: green tap into the potential of your mind
now I warned it to the weak fence make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you're on the defense before you let
the chains fall cuz when you hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: first cuff illusion start to burst off
composure is the protocol steaming on the
[SPEAKER_00]: high grade can sometimes leave you
sideways depending on the content of your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart your children will reach the most
while the wicked and the evil fall apart
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're taken up taken up into the
celestial sweetest high that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: never find vapor soaking me of the holy
green tap into the potential of your mind
[SPEAKER_00]: now let's focus on the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: from city pardon my behavior while I talk
about the greed but there's a moment in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first draw when you exhale then you
inhale then you hold it then you taste it
[SPEAKER_00]: then you exhale then you feel it then you
see what I mean oh then you're taken up
[SPEAKER_00]: taken up into the celestial sweetest high
that you could never find vapor soaking me
[SPEAKER_00]: of the holy green tap into the potential
of your mind when you're taken up taken up
[SPEAKER_00]: into the celestial sweetest high that you
could never find vapor soaking me of the
[SPEAKER_00]: holy green tap into the potential of your
mind when you're taken up taken up taken
[SPEAKER_00]: up taken up taken up
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah you
