[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, the melts have just arrived.
[SPEAKER_03]: Melts in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jibs and Kevin and who's this fucking guy
over here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Buddha Buddha.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Glitrix glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're just gonna call it the
Glitrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty stoked on this entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Two of our two of our good
buddies from Colorado Grew this Buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: Dread smokes weed Dread?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dread grew this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dread grew the Gorilla glue and then our
buddy growing Kushamile High Robert grew
[SPEAKER_01]: the Citrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just decided that'd be like a really
great combination of strains and resin I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna represent some Colorado growers and
make a nice collaborative cup entry
[SPEAKER_01]: between their growing techniques and what
we're doing with our water ash techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Citrix was actually flowered outside
Full Sun Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Gorilla glue was grown inside
so there's a really nice rounded profile
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking A man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna have to get you guys on Hash
Church one of these Sundays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are really digging it and there's a
lot of people listening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably even settled the webcam in the
lab one of these Sundays.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stay really busy but we do keep a
computer in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but making hash during Hash Church
is definitely commendable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll do one this Sunday so I'm
gonna invite a whack of people down for
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash Church this Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get I don't know if we'll do
it here in the room or somewhere else but
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll get a good venue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have maybe two or three computers
open simultaneously with two to three
[SPEAKER_03]: people on each computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you saying, T?
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab session coming down soon or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Last minute crumble check.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last minute crumble check.
[SPEAKER_01]: That teeny little piece that didn't quite
perfectly make it through the micro place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will affect your long-term cure and
just how like an individual gram jar might
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually end up whiting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the things that really make sure
your hash stays perfectly granular when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working with fresh frozen material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfectly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are chunks that might not end up
perfectly dry but it's your job as a hash
[SPEAKER_01]: maker to make sure you can identify those
chunks that are not properly dry so you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't compromise the quality of the rest
of your hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will always be the one little piece
that does not fit perfectly through the
[SPEAKER_01]: sieve or perfectly through the micro
planer that you need to remove from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty quiet in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, is that loud over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so loud over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus H.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're trying to keep it quiet
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too loud over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on out here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No screen tech?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a titanium too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smokey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't think we were going to use
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way to look at some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should have a dab somewhere
soon here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so what do we got here,
Tony?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some strawberry lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was really good actually the
way you had it up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've time and time again just washed 20%
off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry lemon G.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that notable in flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water hash, turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad there wasn't a smell factor on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we dab that up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be close to the Legends
entry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys just rolled in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramon and True Cannablus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some friends from online and some friends
that are just killing it in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're from OCD Labs and True
Cannagenetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So dudes, you guys making some headway for
Legends this year or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramon's been working hard, trolling
through information, trying out a few
[SPEAKER_05]: different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing we've really learned is
material makes the world of difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having some real good material around to
play with and really experiment is the
[SPEAKER_05]: key.
[SPEAKER_05]: And time and dedication because Ramon's
been doing more investigating than he has
[SPEAKER_05]: sleeping recently to try and get our
system ready for the Legends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got all sorts of treats on the
table here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you got there, Jibs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some jelly lemon ale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some wet wash, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a similar kind of color to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you take a dab of this sweet
skunk dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just blow it out the window behind
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're in the non-smoking room with
the fire extinguisher right behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that one's not open.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll open it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, I'll just hold it until it
doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a wonderful lung capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that tasty?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in a rush to get it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I gently let it roll over the tongue
and absorb the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when it's that smooth as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not rushing to get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are clearly professionals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've set up too many alarms and caused too
many problems to not do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the dabs, you think it's cool and
you'll get away with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gets to the point where the session
just sits up all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to get out.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Tert Mounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the Tert Mounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Betty Ross, no?
[SPEAKER_03]: Betty Ross, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is Betty Ross?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Betty Ross was Bruce Banner's girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are our guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want you to catch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been dabbing pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chibs is like, I don't even fucking know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: heading over to SOMA's?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, I'm waiting for those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's not out the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do that every time too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope that one doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be one of the biggest ones for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it on camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: When flavor shocks you so much,
you blow it out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We discussed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not done with a cold check?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done with the same starting material
we use for wet washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the return?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of these vials, he only used
the equivalent of what would be about two
[SPEAKER_01]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got to open it before you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about how it hadn't been
hung or trimmed at all, the cost on it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot less too because not near as many
people have had to handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't had to occupy any space getting
hung dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually getting a pretty good
return as far as just pure terpings off of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that a little bit goes a
really long way too as far as infusing it
[SPEAKER_05]: back to water hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's up next?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a few different ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: One we put sweet skunk dry sift and that
terp melt together.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the terp melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like a Sensi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I've got that smells like
it's from across the SFV chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from an old Sensi store.
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 year old pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's got the same kind of hazy musky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just aggressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Sativa hazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's smell exotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you guys got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they just pulled out some absolutely
fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like here's a cookies cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can get that up a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Girl Scout cookies hit with the
SFV chem melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much everything I've got here was
the same melt that I've used and then
[SPEAKER_05]: popped a whole pack of each one and
selected out the best ones from my cup
[SPEAKER_05]: entries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are some of the other ones that
didn't quite make the cut for the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make a point on shooting these
with the macro lens for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's the Sagan star, which I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the purple cheddar cross SFV chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Granddaddy Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice crystal on that man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the resin is visible from a great
distance.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you guys got your entries over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some of the Granddaddy Terps
entries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a sniff of it because that's got like
a different kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: OCD representing.
[SPEAKER_03]: With cannabis, not red lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another Granddaddy Terps,
but a different plant because we've had to
[SPEAKER_05]: stick a couple different plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've basically, it works out three of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had to divide up for our intro 40
grams because it's the strain,
[SPEAKER_05]: not a cut in or a regrown one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they checked and they said,
yep, that's cool to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it's the same strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's legit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I figure that's a true representation of
what a seed company is capable of.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's an interesting way to enter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of forced upon us, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smell that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one's this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Terp Life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that tangy, jilly bean,
Calio awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's Terp what?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Terp.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Terp Life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Terpzilla.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit with the SFV chem male.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let Jim smell that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name got me excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, yeah, it's very reminiscent of
like tangy, the marmalade, jilly bean,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a creamy orange sherbet
behind like the orange zest, like rotting
[SPEAKER_01]: orange, like that you kind of associate
tangy with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shopping bag full of dank weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one here is the, this is more Terp
Life?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Terp Life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live the Terp Life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that one's lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, that is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one had a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as strong as the orangey one,
but a very nice profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gentle, but complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure is a little bit better with the
light, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is just.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an orangey, but it's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue cheddar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that all looks very impressive,
boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys are contenders as always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll watch for you guys on the stage at
the, at the end of the, event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And did you check out this vushu?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stunning.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of my favorite things about
cup time is that everyone brings out the
[SPEAKER_05]: heavy glass and Europe's just kind of
getting introduced to that whole scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, Flav's coming in like a
day and he's bringing like, listen,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, we'll be hitting some pieces,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be hitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was over at my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, so yeah, I'm going to bring
this one and this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of these three?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can't fit into a photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sheer magnitude of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you see a little selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, wow, I've shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just like a little corner of the.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never been ideal dream collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been photographed in its
entirety as one piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to stand far back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to the dampening gallery and
literally just stand there, walking around
[SPEAKER_05]: in silence, just a door in the glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, you guys are contenders.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep an eye on these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: OCD labs, true can of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming by guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff Wednesday with Tony V.
[SPEAKER_03]: Living it up in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you got there, buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little piece of some cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear that sound?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the right sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that on the bottom?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little greasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more press out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, well, well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that amazing how fast electricity
works here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like just like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really just turn it off right
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unplugged.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like getting gains power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been hitting flavors like they've
been going out of style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can you even try to name off some of
like all the flavors we've been hitting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything from a yogurt, custard,
sour fruit, purple, sweet, sweet,
[SPEAKER_04]: buttery, haze, hazy, skunky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just citrus, lemons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the fabuloso.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue suede shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the blue suede shoes over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was another one that he put
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was the Betty Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Betty Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Betty Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a little Googling on Betty Ross,
you guys, and you'll find out who she is.
[SPEAKER_03]: She may or may not be related.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some form or another to a Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bruce Banner monitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get that last little bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're pressing resin, you require
two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You require heat and or pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more pressure, the more heat is
created.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more heat you use, the less pressure
is required.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two things you require to
press hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've shown quite a few methods over the
years from the old wine bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottle technique and the steaming of
the hash on the stove on low to heat up
[SPEAKER_03]: the resin indirectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is another great way with the oil
slick product there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe you can heat that up to
500 degrees and it doesn't... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're way below that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would suspect we're in the 100
range or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like Christmas when you go to
open it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it should have a nice ring tone to it,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the next thing to do is for us
to dab it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's the Jarela.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jarela.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be Arnie's entry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be Arnie's entry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to do the Lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you open it up a little off that
piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hold it up in the light like I just
did to the Jarela.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Jarela is?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Jarela is Lemon G 13 push banner 5.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is Lemon G Lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I suppose we're going to hit that ASAP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Donkey fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, if you're... Here's a little
ball for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so what are we starting out
with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you got a huge ball on here for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is... Oh my god, it's as hard as a
rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impressive right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to try it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is of course Tony's creation of
the turp melts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis terpenes added back to cannabis
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We of course have a non-smoking room here
at the Kraus Napolsky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still quite a bit here if you want
to hit it.
There you
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a lot of pressing up little
bits of resin, some with turps,
[SPEAKER_03]: some without turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one of course is the Jarela that I
was holding up earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is just greasy and ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely, you know, hard like glass
shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really nice resins.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all just been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the little spoon with the anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to get a picture of like the
spoon filled with the anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a nice shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought you guys would want to join us
anyway for a few rips.
I'll see you guys next time.
