[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a question for Assam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a passionate audience here at
Hash Church that's paying attention right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's one piece of advice you'd give to
cultivators, big or small, who want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients to elevate their game inspired
by what Canara is doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've kind of answered this
question, but I want it to be specific
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want to make a nice clip of it
after the show is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so as I mentioned, you hear me guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, as I mentioned earlier,
I think the main two criteria when talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about nutrients and its correlation with
plants is to look at the gaining weight as
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to the human nutrition and the
quality and quantity of excrement,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, in cannabis, we can't look
at the gain in weight because that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we wait to look at that,
probably it's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main criteria is the quality and
quantity of runoff we generate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes the in the substrate,
the main aspect to assess if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding well our plants or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of quantity, I think we better
we have to target a 10 to 20 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff during the vegetative watering and
no more than 15 percent in the generative.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of EC, and this is the according
to my experience, I mean, it's it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in the book, but it's my own
experience, my own point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unlike other substrates like soil and
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing a rock wall, I recommend
monitoring the EC at the root zone and not
[SPEAKER_00]: at the the runoff level for better
accuracy because it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the the rock wall, it doesn't have the
same criteria as the cocoa or the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why this may maybe have an
additional cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to invest in sensors that
are able to give you real time readings of
[SPEAKER_00]: the EC at the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guarantee that the ROI is evident in
there and especially for large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other point is the weekly leaf
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a I mean, it's a good
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recommend not making drastic change
based on the results of these analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is that the standard nutrient
branch that labs, the labs are using as a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference are very general and they are
not genetic specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they need it needs for their
studies to be specific to group of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars because you get your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a report for you sent samples,
leaf samples, you get a report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you have you're overfeeding on
nitrogen or calcium magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is the reference?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your standard curve in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's are we taking a general one for all
the genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know they don't behave all the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I would take just the
general when it turns to red
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to intervene and reduce your your
nutrient concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't we shouldn't go into the details
and do drastic changes just based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good advice doing it at the
root zone and not the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your levels are high at runoff,
then it's going to be much worse right on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
You.
You.
You.
You.
