[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and welcome to a special special occasion
[SPEAKER_04]: here today on bubble man's world I've
obviously I'm over with Horatio Delbert
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's invited us into the inner sanctum
It's kind of a fairly reclusive cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean we've been friends for a year
and I One way or another everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't invite anyone over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, there's just that space that
Creates I create from and I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, sometimes it proprietary or
secret but One of the homey over we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been friends for a year and share some
things one of the first things I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: share is some turp champagne to celebrate
turp champagne This is actually I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: excited about this so let's check this out
so of course the turps are in the freezer
[SPEAKER_04]: because you know don't need to be leaving
them on the table for any Long stories
[SPEAKER_04]: before we start filming Nice to keep those
turps nice and cold Carbonated so what
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of turps you got there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting It's not that great one is it
no Look at this Right into the carbonated
[SPEAKER_04]: water make your own carbonated water That
was that screeching sound when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: upstairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't even notice Just a soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just figured you would be the kind of
guy that made your own Carbonated water
[SPEAKER_01]: machine one day, but yes, I did carbonate
this water right before So what kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: turpines are we dealing with here turp
champagne It's got a lot of balancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a turp report on it,
but I do have my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we sip it I'll pull that out How
classy is this guy you guys come on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually really looking forward to
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is super cool Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's quite nice isn't it The carbonation
seems essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Delivery mechanism in of it itself
to actually give you I mean you saw how
[SPEAKER_04]: little I was able to put in Really nice to
try and give you guys an explanation it's
[SPEAKER_04]: um You've got this really nice cold
carbonated water and you have This uber
[SPEAKER_04]: subtle yet fairly pronounced in its
aftertaste flavor profile of turpines
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely not a single turpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a profile of turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's check this out at 11% we
got bite balancing for the bud and Selena
[SPEAKER_04]: did you go to the same place that the
great garden Was getting these done it
[SPEAKER_04]: this might be the part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Double Cheers to Matt Double Cheers to
Matt for the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't I wouldn't have noticed it It
doesn't have a really strong shishkeberry
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because it would only be what the
bubble water takes predominantly so to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is more the nose of It's the part I
like like if I still have some warlock
[SPEAKER_01]: Left its warlocks a different string,
but if there's a common fruity Low fruity
[SPEAKER_01]: subtle goodness to it that is skunky like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognize that document though right
away because I have it at my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah The hard copy file on the other side.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Matt's test for the bar and
It's 16% turpinoline, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah a turpinoline a turpinoline I guess
there's a variety of a B's and C's of many
[SPEAKER_04]: of the terpenes that I guess have been
like sub categorized because they've had
[SPEAKER_01]: less There are so many it's literally like
day and night sometimes when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: describing the terpenes in what will you
know possibly be looking into as we go
[SPEAKER_01]: into the lab, but It's funny when I look
at the barb online, they describe it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: citrusy fruity aroma where when I Try
Matt's barb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like no this Is this skunky berry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get into this it's deep and it's
rich, but when I read the description,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let's say from LPs it mainly
comes off as a description of valencine as
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the limonene type of citrus,
but valencine would be from valencine
[SPEAKER_04]: oranges if you if you understand the
difference between a valencine orange and
[SPEAKER_04]: your regular Florida orange that valencine
terpene is the strong component in there
[SPEAKER_01]: that's giving it that Citrus but not
citrus because the last turk which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't get any other description
other than citrus aroma is even higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than the valency and it's the It's selena
dash three comma seven and when I googled
[SPEAKER_01]: where is it selena right under balance Oh
13, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just below above the only description
for the molecule is it's another one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those citruses selena 3 7 and 11 dying
Yeah, it's even higher than the valency so
[SPEAKER_01]: That barb is quite unique how it makes
citrus not citrus Because it's you read
[SPEAKER_01]: these numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh this must be a tangent and
the barb is the Afghani crossed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: shish kebari and I like I just never
considered it citrus like I probably
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't consider balancing it depends on
Where you come from because I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously me being the limonene guy people
would assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that's clearly the smell of
citrus, but it's not You know what I think
[SPEAKER_04]: of you as the limonene guy, but you're
also making a name for yourself in the dry
[SPEAKER_04]: sift world I know you play around with
water extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a jack-of-all-trades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a terpene champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean champagne you do terpene
extraction my real interest is finding out
[SPEAKER_01]: the truth from all how many messages does
the plant have and how many aspects
[SPEAKER_01]: because We're not smoking We're dead sober
and if we were smoking this turp champagne
[SPEAKER_01]: would do something different and I would
These terpene packages in no chef's hands
[SPEAKER_01]: the chef is the bar for this recipe in
this drink And if you want even sparkling
[SPEAKER_01]: water in this profile, you've got to grow
that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true It's a beautiful recipe so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, you know, oftentimes you
try new things It's not really I mean I
[SPEAKER_04]: had seen they were doing these infusements
with wine and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were doing pairings and stuff I
didn't really see it with alcohol,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's nice carbonated water with a turp
profile, I mean It really is that sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: feeling of you know sitting around with a
glass of wine in your hand But I'm not a
[SPEAKER_01]: drinker of alcohol I'm getting the
carbonation plus the terpenes I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: oh dude over my eyes I can tell you from
the session we had right before we sat
[SPEAKER_04]: down here Yeah, and the fact that I
haven't eaten anything all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely Giving me effects nice
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree Compared to drinking the straight
water The carbonation seems to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: delivery mechanism for for that back
membrane, you know to just push those
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes right and whatever it is I mean,
I haven't had champagne in 10 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I remember the bubblies whatever the
bubblies are well, you know, I love the
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbles Absolutely and this is bubblies
for all of us non drinkers who've chosen
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as our modality, so we're gonna
finish up our cup and Probably get into a
[SPEAKER_04]: few different exciting things this
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm really stoked for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you guys soon Cheers All right,
so we are here in the inner sanctum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us more.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well people This is a jug of lemonade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemonade?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Horatio, I didn't know her lemonade
was clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well a lot of people Don't know a lot
about lemonade because it typically comes
[SPEAKER_04]: in a can Like this when you get it And
what does it look like in this form?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it looking more like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that over the course of purchasing
lemonade they come in different cans They
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to come at different ages and I found
some come with the off-color yellow and
[SPEAKER_01]: are already beginning to show signs of
what we're going to go in and talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: but Every nonpolar has mystery oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about gas It's about the objects
that surround it and at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be my weak spot in my entire
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The meaning will take this out That's why
I want this out of the can as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible or else I have more work to do
Make sense Give them a quick little
[SPEAKER_04]: briefing to that bottle is about 95%
delimited and then 5% which he would call
[SPEAKER_04]: the mystery which is Everything it can be
citrus oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be plastic gasket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be all the contaminants that are
not That are damaged just these are terms
[SPEAKER_01]: so they can be damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be just as much damage name
that's converted over so um Now we go into
[SPEAKER_01]: why let's say everyone doesn't just run
out and try to produce an inhalable
[SPEAKER_01]: product When we're talking about food
grade, we're talking about tested for
[SPEAKER_01]: ingestion So if you try to make a limiting
extract for oral use that is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fine But if you grab a can of this,
sorry say can but it's a jazz jug You do
[SPEAKER_01]: not have the technology to isolate What do
we have here does it nice and clear yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: well without going into too much detail
The craze detail that represents that
[SPEAKER_01]: first give the audience I guess a
depiction of the smells of canned limonene
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the purified though no,
this is just straight bigger jug is where
[SPEAKER_01]: I store I'm purified so this one came
right out of the can Yeah, it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in this jug waiting to be
processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so and did it come out of there
looking like that Yeah, this is the finest
[SPEAKER_01]: freshest meaning I've ever gotten out of a
can okay, so it's definitely the best I
[SPEAKER_01]: wish it all smelled like this for people
getting it It's quite light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the smell of that citrus hmm Nice
and clear you can see So out of that With
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've been developing over course of a
very long two years is What I consider the
[SPEAKER_01]: not limiting so give this radical the
smell the 5% that 5% That's no good not a
[SPEAKER_04]: really good smell in that one kind of
bitter Not burnt orange or yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like molding orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to say Because it's so
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to smell it lighter I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna say burnt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna say it's a bit more of a burnt
burnt orange Definitely not It turned my
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach a little bit Well because in the
case of Let's say and that is not from
[SPEAKER_01]: choice material that same product
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go up close to the camera it's got
it quite a nice there we go yields a quite
[SPEAKER_04]: unnatural paraffin waxy result That's what
you is that basically this stuff on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically been allowed to evaporate
and gum up the process to isolate it
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's coming over or staying behind
is Currently because I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential is for the final product it is
private Understandings we don't live in a
[SPEAKER_01]: region in which we have access to the
Addison's and the analytical 360s of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world to define these answers instantly
for an industry, but I do know when you
[SPEAKER_01]: can go from clear and remove this and go
back to clear you cannot just let your
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes your nose and your basic senses be
your guide just like Well if it must be
[SPEAKER_01]: purged, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a it's not a sufficient concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: So did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_04]: He started with clear he got this 5% out
of here, which is clearly not clear and
[SPEAKER_04]: then got back to clear This is chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is medicine making this is sometimes
even alchemy, but it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward even when we're talking
about something as safe as DB mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally messing with our solvents
live in a non-toxic way even when dealing
[SPEAKER_04]: with the solvents refuse Well,
I'll tell you the difference in the smells
[SPEAKER_04]: of the unprocessed the with the 5% It's
got that very tangy rind smell and this is
[SPEAKER_04]: much much much different it you lose the
citrusy smell a lot of it and it's almost
[SPEAKER_04]: this overwhelming plant smell like when
you first cut your plant and I notice it
[SPEAKER_04]: always in the first couple of days of
plants hanging it smells Like this like
[SPEAKER_04]: this beautiful floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't believe that that's But
this is the meaning that it's this is
[SPEAKER_01]: where I live in a world of what I know
what I do and it's it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain and it's why we've gotten to the
point where I've invited mark here to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to shed some light it will mainly produce
many Google searches That's okay get
[SPEAKER_01]: people thinking it's how do you think I
got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's every night doing the last hour on
understanding this deeper limiting taught
[SPEAKER_01]: me everything in chemistry by
understanding it and all the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: would need to do for it it ends up giving
me everything back to the technology you
[SPEAKER_01]: see today to the safety to work in an
indoor environment so I can creatively
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's not like a job where I'm in a
shop or it's my home and as a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: patient who has Industrial behaviors you
saw my kitchen those were grinders of a
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different nature and they're
all stainless steel so sure I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate I Wouldn't even be able to know
chemistry in any kind of decent amateur
[SPEAKER_01]: type way if it wasn't for a safe substance
to actually explore so I'm only This is
[SPEAKER_01]: what this looks exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the forefront of exploration in a
year's time there may be another layer
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out of the clear that I Don't
know about it, and that's what I'm open to
[SPEAKER_01]: finding out so right Let's move on to the
next section will explain kind of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: get limonene and how the generic
principles of how to get it out All right,
[SPEAKER_04]: well we're back here with some new glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just gonna go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I got some old gear in the
retired section of floral aromatics that
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's on the big chase for let's
steam some turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a surplus of plant material good
growers or you know somebody who's already
[SPEAKER_01]: in the essential oil industry and excited
like Matt was and you want to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: steaming and You see a couple different
things on eBay, and you don't really know
[SPEAKER_01]: where to start so um Let's grab some basic
gear and show some basic equipment with
[SPEAKER_01]: steam distillation you've got a basic heat
source your plant material whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: simpler flask like a Smaller just going
from here to here in this scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is steam injection
[SPEAKER_01]: so The point material would spend its life
in there The point of the steam injection
[SPEAKER_01]: port is to essentially be delivering it to
the base so that it rises through the mask
[SPEAKER_01]: is You would fill that up to
three-quarters full of something that
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously will come back out You allow
your condenser to be your condensers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this By feeding the steam energy
through you can actually heat the water at
[SPEAKER_01]: the energy you need to produce tons and
tons of steam efficiently But you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be exposing your plant material to
literally that 212 heat direct heat you
[SPEAKER_01]: just want the steam which is Although it
is direct heat it is not elemental heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't contain any radiant charge
So by allowing for the steam injection
[SPEAKER_01]: port we have it flow upwards You add water
here so that It keeps boiling you add back
[SPEAKER_01]: in here This is the modification so that
you could do it with a lower temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: always chasing a lower temperature the key
when working with turps not even just that
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh lower temperature saves turps it the
more vacuum you use the more the same
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature is bang for your buck so as
long as you have a vacuum sufficient I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: a condenser sufficient to cool those
volatile turps tap water would not cut it
[SPEAKER_01]: for the types of turps you know basically
with water distillation you're gonna end
[SPEAKER_01]: up with a The harder water fraction you're
gonna get way way way more But you won't
[SPEAKER_01]: have that light fluorescence that we've
been getting into with the seven star But
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a richer and sometimes even more
loud of a terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what I consider
one-dimensional I'm looking I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for what I can't identify not for the one
note.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a limited access but it obviously
goes back thousands of years and Pre you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you could see the supertorpe era This
is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the shit to be able to extract on
you could say the bulk essence out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant this is totally shit and when you
add a vacuum port in here and You're
[SPEAKER_01]: cocking this and reintroducing water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're perpetually moving so it would
almost be a simplified
[SPEAKER_01]: That is only really to maintain the
temperature of the glass against your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment so that this doesn't become a
temp condenser right so There's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: chance on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably already gonna be too hot
so you would have whatever Basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you guys running out and
burning things But I want you to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about how if you can get this to just be
55 Celsius something that is still you can
[SPEAKER_01]: expose your wrist too, you can now get
away with a very simple back and so if you
[SPEAKER_04]: were doing the steam injected would the
Heater be only under this one Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we end up in two scenarios if you add
vacuum now water doesn't have the normal
[SPEAKER_01]: vectors to boil There's actually no air.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no air to escape to mm-hmm It will
bump and it will explode and boil so you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to add a magnetic stirring plate Is
there important factors to know when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're googling well if you don't It will
only take a few seconds for you to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: the worst glass banging sound as Water
explodes in here this rocks back and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll come back to the this is what I
came back to ready to go It's it's a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of experience when There's nobody to hit
up on Facebook to say tell me how tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: how give me your tech My tech is I have to
explain to my wife if my theory was
[SPEAKER_01]: incorrect so with the magnetic stir bar
Now you have the capacity to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: water actually blended and actually create
a subtle explosion condition versus it not
[SPEAKER_01]: having anything to tip it off and it just
sits it sits it waits and then it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadful kaboom so Tonight's googling
tonight see being has to have a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more of an expanded profile make sure
You're looking for a heater with a
[SPEAKER_01]: magnetic stirrer if you're trying to get
into something like this classic product
[SPEAKER_01]: from fluorogenics Florigenics yeah,
we make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought this in 2005 does this company
still exist though?
[SPEAKER_01]: They exist the picture that I purchased
looks like the unit still on the front
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't updated anything on these
things don't change but for 800 bucks The
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing I did was chop up every tree
every essential oil every oregano And I
[SPEAKER_01]: was in it for that so cannabis if you've
got the plant material You've got to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a hard on for that kind of essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more everything Well you can give
these guys for genetics a call at one
[SPEAKER_04]: eight seven seven four four six three five
six seven yeah, this is the classic kit
[SPEAKER_01]: and the only other piece of advice that I
think I like is everyone's gonna go why
[SPEAKER_01]: you get it back on this what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I take my age back?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I don't have a back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a aspirator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simple little tea in which the
water runs in one direction and Whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using a tap whether you're using a
garden hose whatever your pressurized
[SPEAKER_01]: source of water is it's 20 bucks It's
plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made just type in Nalgene aspirator
the energy flows by with water and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Venturi that suction that comes off of it
will do nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore essentially I'm giving you
the next level in steam distillation
[SPEAKER_01]: because now you're boiling water at the
temperature your pulse so That opens it up
[SPEAKER_01]: to we're getting into it's as burnt as it
is if you held it in your hand So that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah when it comes to a cold you can
almost say a cold steam distillation And
[SPEAKER_04]: then the alternative I guess the next step
from something like a steam distillation
[SPEAKER_01]: is getting into The hydro diffusion well
when you're looking at hydro diffusion
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're looking at is really a more
efficient delivery of the relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: between the steam and The bud material so
if I was in hydro diffusion delivering it
[SPEAKER_01]: by this method You would with that funnel
you kind of know there's no way the steam
[SPEAKER_01]: is leaving without passing The last of my
nugs before we're in this method you could
[SPEAKER_01]: sit there all day and go I wonder if it's
really steaming to the right I've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: But right here that doesn't look like it's
getting the full brunt of the heat That's
[SPEAKER_01]: why I use this as long as there's a
radiant heat source, and it's damp It will
[SPEAKER_01]: begin the water will begin removing it,
but how your diffusion is now when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into production and Every minute
counts and everything is by the fluid
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce what you produce so long the home
unit person can start here some of you
[SPEAKER_01]: ballers are gonna go for the full
production set and everywhere in between
[SPEAKER_01]: there's room for people where If the
Romans were doing it a thousand years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no excuse not to try if you are
lucky enough to produce plant material for
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself Absolutely, and I think the more
people that try it will be the more minds
[SPEAKER_04]: that are doing it The more breakthroughs
that will have you're gonna get inspired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the first thing if you call for
genetics They're gonna go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not met for vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a custom piece I went to the wine
shops and give me a rubber bum so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: drill it and I made a hot drill piece and
it allowed me to add a second Cork on so
[SPEAKER_01]: that I could pull vacuum at that aspirator
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't gonna back level It's not gonna
implode that was the biggest thing if I
[SPEAKER_01]: used one of my beastie back pumps It's
gonna implode I can almost guarantee it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just not the glass wall
thickness, but Through the body
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature negative twenty eight point
five a twenty dollar aspirator Give the
[SPEAKER_01]: for genetics website at checkout whether
it's for your food whether it's for
[SPEAKER_01]: healing essential oils are all around us
and they're a part of our natural history
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're obviously in Gaga over weed
because of its essential low production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely I mean, this is how the last
thing to kind of put forward is this is
[SPEAKER_01]: how I remove limiting under vacuum if this
was the Olio resin as represented by this
[SPEAKER_01]: Nug I'm using limiting as my solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm introducing water whether by Porter
not it's a matter of efficiency that
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction of water Allows that same
steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just re-steam distilling the limiting
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mystery of how it does not take
everything from the bud is a part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: natural balance just like between dry sift
and bubble hash but Why it allows the
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting that is naturally persistent in
the wheat to persist but the solvent lean
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out is one of the biggest mysteries
to me because when I run a lemon strain I
[SPEAKER_01]: get a true lemon and I couldn't simulate
that true lemon in Leaving all the meaning
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world poured on a batch of well,
so so the deeper in you go the bigger it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets As always and sometimes it gets
sloppy and you gotta back out and check
[SPEAKER_04]: your budget It's great that you've gone
down this road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many years you've been on
this mission of exploring the I'm so
[SPEAKER_01]: proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned this steam distillation set.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of bought on a whim and I'm like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're gonna get Oils and things and
oh, I gotta get back to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Monday And it was just another stupid
$800 but when it when I read those
[SPEAKER_01]: documents that was Talking about the
meaning and everyone's like you can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do it man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the boiling point It's over and
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no
[SPEAKER_01]: something's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Couldn't if you don't try you have to
try you can't just message people online
[SPEAKER_01]: and will this work and they do a mental I
get those messages all the time and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I don't know because you never
figure out things by how they work you
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out things by how they don't work
the combined stack of Well, if this burns
[SPEAKER_01]: because I just before I didn't have that I
literally made my first lecho at a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: Celsius It was already so right out of the
gate and then it was like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are these guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we try the vacuum and on wait a
minute this puppy holds vacuum and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: way faster than a magnetic stir bar And I
don't have with this apparatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using this for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else does it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one of our last segments we'll talk
about the clear and What activated oil
[SPEAKER_01]: that is perfectly been refined actually
looks like and It's even simple enough
[SPEAKER_01]: that this device is paid for itself ten
times over in the fact I couldn't try if I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have it and even if it's not the
most appropriate tool for the job Like
[SPEAKER_01]: this wasn't back then without that
momentum experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put any money where your
thoughts are It's a nice machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the simplest of machines the right Oh
for Mary patient, you don't just go
[SPEAKER_01]: getting rotos that you don't know whether
they're gonna work or not But if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: had some experience on a lesser investment
You can be a little bit more bold and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the things from how the back rooms created
to all the mistakes They help you down
[SPEAKER_01]: this line and this tool will help me one
day when I move up to the next level in
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting by the gallons per hour for
days on end and It'll be automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be coded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be programmed to do all the little
things that I do and That's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: future is looking like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if from this generation of this was a
year and a half We'll see what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: next in the next three years exciting
times man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to seeing what happens
Well, I mean Jamaica's changing the face
[SPEAKER_01]: of things all these new states are coming
along with their legality this year and
[SPEAKER_01]: their markets Speak in their own ways So
true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Jamaica even Gazetted their law
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it goes into effect tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in Jamaica Get active prepare
your land and look for licensing because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a lot of oranges in Jamaica,
too It's half of I'm a very end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will I be able to do kind of guy and
I have property in the citrus district of
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica So knowing that that whole
limiting subject was coming in for the
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial application of removing
Dangerous solvents from the cleaning of
[SPEAKER_01]: machines and equipment degreasing I was
like, oh my god This thing is one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: world changers and what about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about this and in the subtle form?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's replacing these dangerous aspects
Jamaica will be back I'm in the district
[SPEAKER_01]: in which with my steam distillation set
with chopped up orange peels I can produce
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene till the end of time and apply it
back to my cannabis and refine it till the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of time and if they run out basically
I only stop when you society can't So
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna be here for a while as the
Non-polar solution that will outlast
[SPEAKER_01]: governments and a lot last wars as long as
we have the tropics will have a citrus
[SPEAKER_01]: based solvent Petrochemicals just like the
price of gas it's spiking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's shifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's falling and it's It's it's not even a
hundred years old and it's really on its
[SPEAKER_01]: way It's got a limited time track electric
cars are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's it's just a matter of working
on it I'm one man On one course and as
[SPEAKER_01]: time develops We're going to be linking
with many bigger people who are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to say yes to that idea You should
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know I know CRD in Jamaica is
quite excited at the at the aspects of
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting you on board and getting the deal
I'm not as big of a fan of the
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have trust in them I prefer
obviously a solid list sort of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Process I like I like the idea
that you're not using this sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical solvent like hexane or naphtha or
propane I Because I can I'm you know
[SPEAKER_01]: people like stand up and defend chemistry
I'm like which chemistry because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like what my car is doing to the
environment Okay, so if I don't like all
[SPEAKER_01]: the exudates from that and I see what it's
doing even by the colors in the water how
[SPEAKER_01]: can I Cannabis has had a really rough go
and the medicinal hope Is not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the recreational side the drug
experience side and I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing what are the options because the
medicine is what your grandmother's crying
[SPEAKER_01]: for it's ideal we deal in the recreational
where we deal in the macho world,
[SPEAKER_01]: but When we're shitting our pants and
we're looking for help You're hoping for
[SPEAKER_01]: the absolute best and I've seen everyone
change their recreational tongue to look
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for my nan and I do my best with
what I do and I'm the best of my time but
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could put if there's a one chance
in a million that this makes a different
[SPEAKER_01]: difference I want to choose to trust
nature before trusting the best of man's
[SPEAKER_01]: current thinking because man's always
giving us the best of their current
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking and We think really hard and we
make amazing things in a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like who can't believe we built it
out of that That's fucking crazy from a
[SPEAKER_01]: concept or an idea, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I heard I'm like there's one
nonpolar because nonpolar is It's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different way to grab when you go through
the grocery store and For those orals for
[SPEAKER_01]: those ingestion for the prana line that
there's all these different ways of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at it We're without the beefing
over the smoke that I'm I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I trust hexane or butane
or propane to give me the appropriate cash
[SPEAKER_01]: grab non-polars are grabbing all kinds of
shit and or not and We'll take a look at
[SPEAKER_01]: some lipid fractions, but what we've I've
found is leaving is choosing or not to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things and it's more polar than I
typically would have imagined and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: saying yes to more of the the aspect that
I guess I always thought the semi the
[SPEAKER_01]: semis in the polars and I was like Really
really limiting semi polar house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like having all the benefits of
being able to soak the weed for 12 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: and it not turn green But I'm getting the
actual medicinal grab of the alcohol polar
[SPEAKER_01]: side your planet profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get this tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be data we can if this is
something that we can show the future
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a whole lot brighter than just
thinking it's a way to stay safe in your
[SPEAKER_01]: basement because Look, there's always
gonna be guys that want to drive fast and
[SPEAKER_01]: have hot rods and they have skills to keep
them safe Yes, and they're in our industry
[SPEAKER_01]: welding machines together to keep you safe
Yeah, and I support them in that aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: because people are gonna do what they're
gonna do a whole different level from real
[SPEAKER_04]: There's there's a multitude of levels when
you talk about the EHL or the chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: solvent extraction community Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a different level You've got the
best thinking of the fucking era and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got the worst of I just want to
make a buck out of this crap and in the
[SPEAKER_04]: same in the same era and the best Thinking
is a very small percentage and that I just
[SPEAKER_04]: make want to make a buck is a very large
percentage It's unfortunate that it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: success of it seems to be rooted in that
prohibition based dollar that really high
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar It is I mean some people go well,
what's your LHO gonna cost and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well It's gonna be it's gonna be something
that is gonna be insurable That's the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference with your insurance when
cannabis starts getting its respect and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's growing I saw there's one little
place in Canada that will your company
[SPEAKER_01]: supports it will support your little LP on
what you need and I'm like well when
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceuticals of no one that personally
buys them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's half you half insurance sure and if
you Want to experiment with randomness?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the gray market the black market
when we get to a point where there's proof
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's evidence This is safe for you
beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made from this The red stuff is out
because yeah, I believe that red stuff may
[SPEAKER_01]: kill somebody even though it's limiting
base It's natural what if and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think So markets gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be able to do things on a
level that let's see what meaning extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: it wrong It pulls different things and
maybe what it pulls is good for topicals
[SPEAKER_01]: like game-changing good for topicals You
never know that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm opening up my wall so that
Googling is hot for Janice doesn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck happened with all those
calls and You guys are inspired to
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially develop a career in chemistry
if you're looking at a guy who?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just had some shit in his closet and
worked a computer job at his desk say I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't fucking go through another fucking
PDF Before I try to blow some meaning when
[SPEAKER_01]: I go home turn into what you see now it's
It's totally something you shouldn't you
[SPEAKER_01]: should do whether you use chemicals or not
is a matter of the times You all love
[SPEAKER_01]: Turks because we all love weed and that's
mutual ground we all meet on and water
[SPEAKER_01]: loves extracting and It's a mutual ground
we all meet on and now everyone's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting it here with Hydro diffusion steam
distillation vacuum no vacuum It's get the
[SPEAKER_01]: ball rolling you see it and it's simple
and you can get a price So don't be
[SPEAKER_04]: intimidated and as Jesse from Breaking Bad
would say science bitch Peace ratio got
[SPEAKER_04]: him to his house burnt him up in a
limiting fire Back for another segment.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you gonna?
[SPEAKER_04]: Take us through this time ratio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean we went through the last
segment and it was kind of a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: too forward everyone Yeah, yeah,
I hear you remove it with water and steam,
[SPEAKER_01]: but where's the extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do if I want to try something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight tonight, so I grabbed a little
green material so that we could do a
[SPEAKER_01]: little basic extraction the kind of
situation you're gonna get yourself into
[SPEAKER_01]: in your kitchen or I don't know this is
the Old-school way on you pretty much end
[SPEAKER_01]: up at the bond shop Looking for a butane
tube, but instead of using it mouth open
[SPEAKER_01]: with the butane going in through the top
You'll be turning it upside down and
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing it and not using butane at all
pretty much and not using pressure I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll be using vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just gonna pack a basic tube with
The kind of material that if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver if you're someone helping
someone who's sick You're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: getting on the nuts the nuts the nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna be trying this with something
in between so So it's pretty frosty trim
[SPEAKER_01]: and popcorn, but yeah, I mean really I'm
just kind of this is crude enough that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's this is gonna be what most people in
the Bad situation want to try this we're
[SPEAKER_01]: sick of the only option being isopropyl
alcohol, which is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-considerable like if that's what
happens when you finally go I can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: any help and is reach for isopropanol
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna do it it won't do it for me
or other people so that especially people
[SPEAKER_01]: with Crohn's because polars Solvents tend
to pull the chlorophyllic elements that
[SPEAKER_01]: upset people's immune system like in
Crohn's disease their whole digestive
[SPEAKER_01]: tract gets thrown off by So if you're one
of those patients this may help you so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: literally Not going to put a lot of heart
and effort into the packing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just gonna Pack it up nice dry
material now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that you look for when
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of where polarity if this was
alcohol absolutely because the water
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship is going to totally go for
that in the case of No I've done it live
[SPEAKER_01]: Your removal of water is something that
your skill in the road debate is where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to come down to it's not really
going to come down to The starting
[SPEAKER_01]: material, but what it will affect is how
the leaning travels over the surface and
[SPEAKER_01]: how much leaning you use How much you get
back and how much you can pre grind if
[SPEAKER_01]: this was sticky gooey nonsense?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would be the two would actually be
packed in balance you would have air spots
[SPEAKER_01]: where the leaning would just go to the
left and Where when it's broken down you
[SPEAKER_01]: get something more realistic, so I'm just
going to hit it with one of my old
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite tools I Forgot it did that with
the weed when you don't You got a you got
[SPEAKER_01]: your loads keeping all over from below
yeah sure is all right
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you pack it to Life in the lab
yeah little rubber to make it gentle
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when it comes to extracting for sport
the sport of extracting the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: extract and the pressure of extracting
that is a completely different subject and
[SPEAKER_01]: One of high competition like any other
field of endeavor where men get
[SPEAKER_01]: testosterone at the last second It usually
does so we're just going to apply a little
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuum assist Just point to it where the
energy is pulling yeah, and let's get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of this table
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So you got your vacuum on yeah Nice
brutal tilt you got your purified
[SPEAKER_01]: delimiting yes, sir You like to do the
honors of the solvent extraction well sure
[SPEAKER_03]: What I pour it all through I think that's
enough for that level of truth You haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: broken down to just having done quite a
quite a few runs that you know how much
[SPEAKER_01]: you would pour through per tube Well,
I mean when I'm going into my you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: could say the home sport edition That
process would have been done at small
[SPEAKER_01]: renewables to create a stack of extremely
packed material sure so the leaning would
[SPEAKER_01]: travel through a lot slower, but This
being a nice loose pack you get a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: You really do it was like a quick wash
boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going through a little slower
now Yeah, so now you kind of do you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring the camera close in for the folks
are you can see that drip down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just give them the fill line So
[SPEAKER_01]: now actually as you can you kind of get a
sense of the pressures building now So now
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not flowing through as quickly
because on the plant materials become
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated So it's actually starting to
swell And become a slightly slower
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction So that might go for 20-25
minutes depending on That rate of pull So
[SPEAKER_01]: as you can even see just me letting go of
the vacuum And pulling it again the light
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of water in the main class
Vaporizes up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, try that again So if you ever
Wondering am I even getting back you that
[SPEAKER_01]: is your great way to tell great way to
tell quick interaction and Now this is
[SPEAKER_01]: like okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want every drop that is kind of why we
brought it into it first went through
[SPEAKER_01]: quick It saturates, and then this would be
a slow extraction in the case of on Like
[SPEAKER_01]: an extraction method with one of these
don't cut all the parts nearby,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the tube would be of a different
diameter and We'd be using vacuum and
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure in at the top so this funnel just
becomes this funnel at the micro
[SPEAKER_01]: industrialization scale but Everything
matches and everything is toe-to-toes so
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future with faster perch times and
safer setups like this we can introduce a
[SPEAKER_01]: different type of extraction artist into
the game um it won't just be women on the
[SPEAKER_01]: hair straighteners making rosin,
but every mother can participate in
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction like this that's safe and We
can take a quick look in at what I would
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend be the next step for someone
who's not in the little big category Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well show us what we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back so We took out a little bit of
isolate I noticed that in me and marks
[SPEAKER_01]: reference I didn't actually filter it so
there's a little bit of plant material in
[SPEAKER_01]: this, but this is not the normal style But
um so you've got a little bit of a gold
[SPEAKER_01]: squeeze What I'm advising people at home
to do because you're going to be trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the limiting back to an oral ingestion
level on You won't be able to remove this
[SPEAKER_01]: at any level that makes it a smokeable
product Even without that secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting that I've presented, but um this
is food-grade meaning it's qualified for
[SPEAKER_01]: food and it's non-toxic so You would take
in thin films You just want to pour out
[SPEAKER_01]: the papyrus of thin films just enough to
cover the surface and Then what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be introducing it to is not
vacuum distillation, and we're not even
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be adding water But and this is
why it won't work in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be using ionic breeze to
actually evaporate the limonene The same
[SPEAKER_01]: way it will eventually leave the surface
of the table This will allow you to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to something that is about five
percent limiting if you smoke it and try
[SPEAKER_01]: to have fun with your buddies You're going
to get a harsh experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you've seen us all with our
dabbing with these turps But if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to make an oral product you would
introduce that into the food dehydrator
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would leave it to purge and You
would use as many layers as you need to to
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate these in thin film runs so every
24 hours you would check it and You would
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially examine the surface for any
form of on tilt and you're literally
[SPEAKER_01]: looking But when you get the final product
you should End up with that same paste of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sludge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be red like this, but that
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not pouring limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's liquid and What you'll be able to do
from there when that comes up the other
[SPEAKER_01]: end is you'll be able to scrape it up and
In a dish or your standard method you can
[SPEAKER_01]: then introduce that into your coconut oil
for your decarboxylation process if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to just decarboxylate on its
own during that process if you were to
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say You're really in a pinch you
could cook this down straight You could
[SPEAKER_01]: just go straight through bypass this and
just cook this down at its true boiling
[SPEAKER_01]: point of 177 Celsius and you would be
decarboxylating it at the same time I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like those temperatures meaning is
still flammable So I don't prefer to heat
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I don't want to alter it in any
unknown way Until the majority of its
[SPEAKER_01]: removed because it's the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to decarboxylate not cook the
meaning in front of them So I still prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone find your local food
dehydrator if you have a cylindrical one
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to bust out a rack in order
to give yourself room, but All right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the temperature 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I said it at Anything past the
flash point is in potential auto ignition
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, so Your home is going to be
filled with limonene vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to suffuse your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any Heating elements that
kicks on to start this up to it Even
[SPEAKER_01]: lightly far towards your meaning so set it
up 41 Celsius 105 Fahrenheit And leave
[SPEAKER_01]: that for 24 to 48 hours depending on how
thin of a film as soon as you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that exhibits no tilt You can move
into the phase of heating that for your
[SPEAKER_01]: final process So whether you want to go
crude and put this on a stove and
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerously heat it
[SPEAKER_01]: But I prefer this method and I prefer many
shelves because you only need a very thin
[SPEAKER_01]: amount to operate For any one day this is
not an industrial process But I found and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot of parents that get into
that CBD donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do with this plant material?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got to make Oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're told you Google and you
try and what are my options you hear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isopropanol ethanol butane Coconut oil and
your instincts of I want for the buck You
[SPEAKER_01]: wish you you don't trust that coconut oil
is a nonpolar and able to do the job you
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine You just go what are the guys
doing and if?
[SPEAKER_01]: Worse you just go can you just get a guy
to do it for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a scenario in which you know
where the health food stories and even if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't source Limiting from New
Direction Aromatics in the US or Canada or
[SPEAKER_01]: green terpene calm Everyone can open up a
few Pills of limiting and everyone can
[SPEAKER_01]: extract a few resin heads and pour over a
small amount and get a small extract that
[SPEAKER_01]: Will heat down to something you can make
an oil into so I only prefer it for the
[SPEAKER_01]: larger scale there are many solutions for
the individual but when trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, whatever it is that's not
tested with why nonpolars do Grab that
[SPEAKER_01]: other portion of head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hardest to study because it's
hardest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally like a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's It's nothing there, but it's All of
the it's a major part of the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a major part of whatever makes the
taste different makes the high different
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're part of the profile and if in
the oil that treats stops the seizure in
[SPEAKER_01]: five minutes versus five hours It makes a
difference huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather people use something like this
because um this amount of Sold in a bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: to you in capsules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have to say I just took a few dabs
of it earlier right before we filmed this
[SPEAKER_04]: sequence and I feel quite nice it was uh,
there was very little of the The the
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor of the the strains seem to come
through more than in the past like which
[SPEAKER_01]: is Quite a while ago now in a learning
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been um, I Don't have a background in
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm self-taught out of a deep spiritual
sense that There was a void not being
[SPEAKER_01]: addressed in a natural way pretty much and
it was in the nonpolar realm It was the
[SPEAKER_01]: one space where I was like everything else
has a holistic solution You can access the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your bubble hash You've got
heating it in coconut oil whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant material or an isolate Yeah,
everyone can get rolling but um in this
[SPEAKER_01]: one mysterious category where everything
is metallic Everything is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no room for anybody to enter and
now Most of you have one of these you may
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go to your bond shop to try at
grinding your hands on a tube But you can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce a tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an oversized tube and it's overkill
for the task But most of this is still
[SPEAKER_01]: eBay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just looking for a vacuum assisted
flask and these two worlds meet and You
[SPEAKER_01]: could be in a food dehydrator producing
something that is ready to decarboxylate
[SPEAKER_01]: and is as strong as any other nonpolar
product without the risk Awesome,
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well gotta thank you for taking us through
all of this This is definitely I'm sure an
[SPEAKER_04]: eye-opener for a lot of the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it's got you guys thinking Yeah,
and he's giving you guys at least 20 plus
[SPEAKER_04]: terms that if you Rope them down as you
were watching this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a lot of good googling ahead of
you Well, we're gonna go for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: stage when we meet up on the couch and
we're gonna check out how I decarboxylate
[SPEAKER_01]: my LH To produce a product that I believe
is working for everything and it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: closest thing I can do to produce
something like the Prono line until that
[SPEAKER_01]: technology is Licensable and we're in a
position in Canada where I could even be a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of producing it for the masses So
this is what I'm doing and we'll check
[SPEAKER_01]: this out next more dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah All right back All right,
we're finishing up here and um,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about decarboxylating and
that whole science What I presented on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is a product that travels around
the US under the name the clear raw Many
[SPEAKER_01]: of you know it who are in the circles that
You know pretty much produce on extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the general public what the clear
raw represents is a product that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: dab You can use topically and you can use
orally but mainly the process guarantees a
[SPEAKER_01]: full decarboxylation Because the product
has been vaporized and literally just like
[SPEAKER_01]: we looked at in the vials from one to the
next You know, it hit its critical boiling
[SPEAKER_01]: point for activation where?
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole spectrum of active inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I pressure cook for five hours?
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it turn to CBN?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody no one's down to a science on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind on the cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So From a perfected standardizable
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very pro the technology what's
happened is with Clear raw like this
[SPEAKER_01]: people were tempted to add artificial
terpene so that they could enter into the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational market and that's where the
negative association to things that bear
[SPEAKER_01]: that name tend that's where it comes from
the adding of artificial terpenes like
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene and then naming the product with
traditional marijuana name, but the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: product decarboxylated is fantastic it is
all the Just like our so but because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that factor of not being dirty the
recreational activated smoke is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Now give this a smell just for its own
sake Let me grab you very light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Make up more smell now
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I pull off a fraction that is
pretty much to me almost straight mercy In
[SPEAKER_01]: order to actually just make it I'm pushing
the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to push the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this smell is one of the fractions I
call them the burnt terpenes But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is um, pretty much the final smell no
matter what the result This is almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversion of all the terpenes are
making the product into The product that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what the oil used to smell like yeah Well,
not the oil that you all typically just
[SPEAKER_01]: not like, you know the LHL of the day,
but this Sorry, you meant this you meant
[SPEAKER_04]: this no I just mean from a long time ago
the first LHL that I saw smelled strong
[SPEAKER_04]: and more like that and this stuff Doesn't
have that strong orangey smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's just seemed like I don't know if
it's The process of you cleaning out the
[SPEAKER_04]: red coloring from the clear delimiting,
but it's just well something you've done
[SPEAKER_01]: has made it Cleaner this is the thing
about this everyone goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've seen your shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the big deal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they don't know that the the
impurities within the product then turn
[SPEAKER_01]: black So when you're on the open market,
you could say looking for help what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get is Something I saved from you
know what you call a bad example um,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the black trash and you're supposed
to heat that up and this is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: activated and hope for the best and When
you're fighting cancer when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting something serious, you're not
just trying to get high for the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um This difference is everything because
within this stuff was even you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could say respectably dark But when
it's black and when it's cream when it's
[SPEAKER_04]: green that looks so much nastier as I'm
playing with this It's just remember I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just remembering what people actually
swallow when they get their vials because
[SPEAKER_01]: when you get it in this form You don't
really see it So let's put this up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the old Rick Simpson You take
it and you smear it and if you see yellow,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you see green you throw it back but
What
[SPEAKER_01]: we have here is Future of standardized
medicine in inactivated form it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have now it's ready to be combined with
other things the essential plant nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: the Plant fats the other terpenes even the
original terpenes from the material That's
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm hoping to do is be able to
combine something like this with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: other components that represent on the
prana line Tony has the unique capacity to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce both active and inactive product
but for the active side of things for the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC intense therapy things and I'm gonna
move into seeing how it extracts CBD I
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't ask for more Well, I guess I should
Hit this
[SPEAKER_01]: Now hitting decarbed oil almost like back
when people used to cook what's
[SPEAKER_01]: experientially the hit like compared to
even rosin or even the regular
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of Everyone says a decarb hit
is different just like people used to cook
[SPEAKER_01]: their hash or try to pre-burn it and I'm
like How can it be different if it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: same decarb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxalation when I inhale but it's something
different I have a very high tolerance and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not typically able to circum to a high
enough to go to sleep, but um when I find
[SPEAKER_01]: that because I don't know I don't have my
phone but I burnt this finger pretty bad a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days ago and Instead of running
for the standard cold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like you just made this just do that
Just coat it and I coated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never blistered and it never I'll show
you the pictures later But um,
[SPEAKER_01]: my skin was like bacon the when bacon
turns white It's not supposed to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: watch out for that white bacon Well when
your hands are black and it starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: sizzle up like the white part and bacon
you've been burnt we all know my my rig
[SPEAKER_01]: fell off the desk and I grabbed the email
to save it and clutched it with the fiery
[SPEAKER_01]: heat put it back before taking back my
hand Without the we don't know what is a
[SPEAKER_01]: skin cell like what actually stuff the
dark stuff versus the light stuff did
[SPEAKER_01]: purified by heat evaporation leaving I
Actually will show you really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is left behind?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can stay put it was quite a nice Quite
a nice dab there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really some very very clear golden
Eliminating extract Wow This is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't get to come along for your ride and
your experience and this is using a
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene extract that is already clean But
this is all that represents.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's not medicine in even my best work
so um, this was about 60 grams and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's not acceptable to me and It's what
makes you irritated if it's what locks a
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor from getting what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wanted out and I want to focus on
all the potential topically orally and
[SPEAKER_01]: even inhalation wise because
Psychoactively it does seem to benefit me
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bedtime style that my overactive mind
Doesn't typically succumb to when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I Just hope in the near future This is
the standard when you go into a compassion
[SPEAKER_01]: club looking for help instead of the
standard being a questionable black mass
[SPEAKER_01]: given to you in a needle and You're lucky
enough to get it when you get it a Little
[SPEAKER_01]: dab sure might go a bit further than just
yeah, that would be a very little I might
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce the needle sauce the top So this is
kind of where you end up going like this
[SPEAKER_01]: and then taking your dose for the day and
Whatever wounds ail you topically usually
[SPEAKER_01]: at this value right now with people who
actually Need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of backed off topical until I
can produce enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no Even I could handle being
burnt if that same dose could be given to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who's literally in pain and
suffering so that's my focus right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Hopefully we've got a compassionate
network in Canada that opens up a market
[SPEAKER_01]: where We can get something like this I
just I can't deal with the mysterious
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and when you get to cannabis You're
on your last hope you didn't just I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to use cannabis because I just got a
sniffle You've already been through the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy pharmaceutical ringer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've had every side effect from what
has been Government told you the
[SPEAKER_01]: government says it's good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is safe and you can do it and guess
what you did that for six weeks and now
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else is falling off railing you
so if you get to the point we're like I
[SPEAKER_01]: want cannabis I need cannabis and I'm
hoping for a natural solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Hope you don't end up with something
like this when you Finally get it because
[SPEAKER_01]: you got it on the cheap in a way you could
afford But do you research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well right now a lot of different grades
out there Unfortunately, I'm the only
[SPEAKER_01]: person who can produce this in Canada out
of the same man cave lab comes many
[SPEAKER_01]: desperate I needed to create this I had
somebody that Had a type of cancer that
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't going to tolerate high doses of
questionable amounts, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: children that need THC therapy So I needed
to be Exact as my knowledge would allow me
[SPEAKER_01]: to be at this age So that's what came out
and hopefully in a week or so We're
[SPEAKER_01]: posting test results that at least show
fully decar with a high percentage of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: because Everything that would register to
lower your values has been left behind So
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get to that and Cheers to all the
artists in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping in making clear raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a couple of artists with I
forget it was something for kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was definitely cannabis related in
the person was producing large much larger
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts than I was and Directly focusing
it on the child demographic with their CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: product So I'm very proud to see that
versus seeing another person brag that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've added turps And they've made a
fake flavor to try to create a market for
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves So let's do this Very good What
an awesome day super stoked to have been
[SPEAKER_04]: invited into the inner sanctum here with
Horatio He's shown all these wonderful
[SPEAKER_04]: things that you guys have also been seeing
we've been you know everything that he's
[SPEAKER_04]: showing me is Is getting shown to you
guys, so it's a really cool thing I know
[SPEAKER_04]: it's been a long time coming and a long
journey for you to get here where you
[SPEAKER_01]: could get to a point where you could share
Well, you know I'm Each breakthrough is
[SPEAKER_01]: not complete just because it's something
that you want to announce to inspire But
[SPEAKER_01]: um there's a difference between knowledge
and information and information can be
[SPEAKER_01]: very dangerous And used it responsibly
consider all the people who I initially
[SPEAKER_01]: taught to make LHL But we're impatient and
not interested in what I said about
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something in this that I want to
dress before we go feeding it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: masses Well, they went and fed it to the
masses so that really put A hampering on
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, yeah, so I heard about LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of presented the home use I'm
still working just like we've made this
[SPEAKER_01]: breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is new and everyone's gonna be asking
about this They're not even gonna remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the LHL right now because even for me this
takes priority over Any recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: product I want to make for myself to smoke
I need this because I need tea cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I love about this is previously
This is a blend of coconut oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: cinnamon to make a sublingual Okay,
but I was literally eating cashews and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just had that instinct and went in on one
cashew and it went in my mouth and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: gone and because that fat protein within
an hour and a half I had that I Don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: time to get Orally high typically as a
workaholic, but it is the absolutely the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine I need and I found with this that
it I could be put in a state in which I
[SPEAKER_01]: could still function and I have no Concept
or sense if that's even because Tony's big
[SPEAKER_01]: on keeping the turps That's why he bottles
it seals it and when he activates there
[SPEAKER_01]: with the product where this is without and
I scratch my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I'm missing the turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if if this was in this even though
they're burnt?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key who knows so um it that's
why I'm not so quick to the gun because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the people who let's say Get
investments to follow the inspiration that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out of my small lab will do much
More damage if they do it in the wrong way
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of why I exercise
professional caution where everyone's like
[SPEAKER_01]: hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is weed share it up once you got it
and Open up So it's been an amazing day
[SPEAKER_04]: man, and yeah, I'm really once I gotta
say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, dude for the nice LHO rips What
are you calling that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This currently I just take the name that
everyone currently understands which is
[SPEAKER_01]: the clear rock Obviously, it's Rob because
it's not had the terpene adulteration that
[SPEAKER_01]: is the standard, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not raw because it's raw cannabis or
I managed to decarboxylate in space It's
[SPEAKER_01]: raw because the standard concept when you
hear the word clear is adulterated with
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes Mystery science and but when you
hear the name clear do you assume that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was extracted in a particular way it used
to be that the clear was branded as It's
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent free down to the parts per billion
because of this destructive distillation
[SPEAKER_01]: method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces a pretty tasteless on product
Yeah, it's gonna get stuck to you in this
[SPEAKER_01]: team, but I'm cool activated cannabis
Doesn't really have like whether I brand
[SPEAKER_01]: it or not The key is I activate it all but
the extraction process the extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: process for this whole this would be no
This would be short path distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay of of limonene extract Or of BHO is
what it's typically done with in the
[SPEAKER_01]: states No, I'm sensitive even to the off
gassing from trying to stack up piles so
[SPEAKER_01]: although it is scientifically testable as
Solvent free because the process yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it does cook the shit out of everything It
doesn't mean when we hit the proton NMR
[SPEAKER_01]: stage that radicals don't defuse over and
recondense because I'll tell you when you
[SPEAKER_01]: there is oil I cannot make clear out of
and it's oil that Contains sulfur in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant because sulfur burns at a similar
temperature and it recondenses back into
[SPEAKER_02]: the product Throwaway product anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is if you eat Well,
the thing is you don't know if is this
[SPEAKER_01]: been burnt or is this have sulfur?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all it all let's say comes in dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am I took on Oh, yeah, let's try
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if everyone can I make water
into wine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we pull it out of this and during the
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like something is not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not like regular Dark stuff on so
this is a distillate a distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah of LHO The LHO was in this flask and
out of the other end of the equation comes
[SPEAKER_01]: that I am only focused on the medicinal
aspects Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's once that's that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's I finally kind of caught on I mean,
I guess I've been a little dabbed out guys
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new to me, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do a lot of these type of
experiments Extraction so I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: learning a lot along with you guys I know
some of the chemistry and some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: tools that are used but I obviously have
no knowledge of delimiting extract so it
[SPEAKER_04]: was very Educational for myself for sure
when I saw what was left behind I was
[SPEAKER_01]: finally proud of myself that I've done
something I was sure would be strong
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine in the traditional sense that
goes back centuries this is more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: healing product than anything I've ever
done and I'm happy I was able to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: with LHO so that I can guarantee the
continuity of that natural harmony to the
[SPEAKER_01]: final end so one day This are so this
90-day program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be a smorgasbord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be randomness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and You're seeing the first stages of
it here first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks for watching bubble man's
world guys and Thanks Horatio for having
[SPEAKER_04]: us over
