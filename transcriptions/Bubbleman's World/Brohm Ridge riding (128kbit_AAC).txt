[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and welcome To epic nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have jumped on my I guess anti-nature
machine dirt bikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people find them obnoxious I grew
up on them since I was seven years old So
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a different affinity for them as
most but I try to be as polite as I can
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm driving on trails and whatnot
Maintaining the nature of the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: without going off the trail That being
said I am up here in the Garibaldi Brome
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridge absolutely surrounded by Nature and
nothing but you can see there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of snow up here I've actually
gotten about as far as I can get I usually
[SPEAKER_00]: go up to the peak of that mountain up
there I'm trying to see if I can get up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left side here My buddies are just up
on the other side of the mountain about to
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot some guns and I figured I would do a
little Vapor session with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my uptech here so I got to give a
shout out to Gary and Sam from uptech and
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give those guys monster props for
hooking me up with some wonderful quality
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizers Beautiful To give you an idea
where I am this is north in the background
[SPEAKER_00]: if you see that little peak of mountain
that's called That's the black tusk and
[SPEAKER_00]: the black tusk can be seen of course very
well from here in Brome But it can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: seen quite well from Whistler Mountain if
you've ever been on the peak of Whistler
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain You can absolutely see the black
tusk peak pretty beautifully from there.
