[SPEAKER_22]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and Happy 420 to all of you.
[SPEAKER_22]: It is of course April 20th today
celebrations going on all around the world
[SPEAKER_22]: for those of us who Live this plant day in
and day out who have love for this plant
[SPEAKER_22]: and who are forwarding the education and
the pushing of a legalization of being
[SPEAKER_22]: allowed to use this plant whether
medicinally recreationally preventative or
[SPEAKER_22]: even industrial like clothes and other
Industrial applications that cannabis
[SPEAKER_22]: obviously has Pretty exciting day today.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've got to d4 20 K's in the house.
[SPEAKER_22]: Johnny B's got a booth down at the Art
gallery where cannabis culture will be
[SPEAKER_22]: setting up with many many booths.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's usually bands and comedians and
speakers Activists and of course a lot of
[SPEAKER_22]: cannabis a lot of edibles a lot of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I figured we'd start off the day.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've got a Little blue satellite bubble
hash from the interior from a good friend
[SPEAKER_22]: of mine I've got a little bit of d4 20 K
dry sift last of the gift og Kush.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's always a pleasure And then of
course, I've got a little of Horatio's
[SPEAKER_22]: distilled delimiting.
[SPEAKER_22]: So his newest product the raw raw and I
figure what we'll do is we'll maybe Well,
[SPEAKER_22]: we'll have a little dab a little variety
of all of them I've got the Swiss perk as
[SPEAKER_22]: well as the straight fab both with bangers
on them and Yeah, why don't we have a dab?
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, so I've got my dabbers right here
Got the hive and the skillet tool I figure
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably a good start will be to Put a
little of the D limonene onto the hive
[SPEAKER_22]: Ripper Dip that into the d4 20 K dry sift
and that's just great There we go And then
[SPEAKER_22]: what do I wake and bake with we got Swiss
perk we got straight fab I say we go Swiss
[SPEAKER_22]: perk it sort of seems to me like the og
unit Well, this isn't good There we go All
[SPEAKER_22]: right, so yeah, we're gonna hit the og the
Swiss perk My torch be might be on the its
[SPEAKER_22]: last legs And this actual little banger is
from the Dabinator Dabinator sent this
[SPEAKER_22]: little banger out with the unit when he
sent it and That's quite a nice little
[SPEAKER_22]: unit German quartz Not as thick as my DC
glass, but I find the DC glass ones are so
[SPEAKER_22]: thick That it is a bit of a challenge to
heat up with my little creme brulee torch
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not one of these huge torch guys that
has the big power shot or whatever else I
[SPEAKER_22]: just got the little baby ones and I find
that the sometimes the smaller quartz
[SPEAKER_22]: bowls a little easier to light up Happy
420 everybody
[SPEAKER_22]: Very nice Beautiful little combination
there.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the next one what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go for a dunk We'll go
[SPEAKER_22]: straight fab right to dunk this actually
nice little pile of bubble hash right here
[SPEAKER_22]: be bringing this down to 420 today and See
if I can't share some bowls with some
[SPEAKER_21]: people So, yeah this bowl right off the
bat is much thicker gonna take a little
[SPEAKER_21]: bit longer To heat up and that's okay
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll get it working pretty excited today
that I'm gonna try and get up to John's
[SPEAKER_22]: Hotel room that he rented and set up my
camera on the tripod and I want to get
[SPEAKER_22]: from 417 to about 425 and show you guys
what it looks like in Vancouver when
[SPEAKER_22]: 20,000 plus people spark a spliff or a
bowl or a dab also Simultaneously,
[SPEAKER_22]: it is really quite something to be a part
of if if you've never done it I urge you
[SPEAKER_22]: to go down and hang out in your city's 420
gallery You don't have to be the biggest
[SPEAKER_22]: supporter of cannabis to go down and show
your support and it always is helpful
[SPEAKER_22]: because The face of cannabis is the many
faces.
[SPEAKER_22]: There is no stereotype of a cannabis user
There's many many many faces of cannabis
[SPEAKER_22]: and so it's important that all the faces
get out and represent Here we go
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow really nice taste on that Particular
hash Blue satellite and I believe there
[SPEAKER_22]: might even be some sweet tooth in there as
well a couple of breeder Steve strains
[SPEAKER_22]: Something that I haven't seen come across
my desk in some time I've seen the
[SPEAKER_22]: grapefruit and I've seen the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_22]: Obviously it's in my garden But I have not
seen blue satellite or sweet tooth for
[SPEAKER_22]: some time.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've got about 50 55 grams of it here
and I'll I'll go down today and do my best
[SPEAKER_22]: to see how many people I can Blaze out
with it And of course, we'll make some

[SPEAKER_22]: we're about to get this little session
going on I just got this from D nail the
[SPEAKER_22]: triple threat ninja nail it's got the red
gold and green we're gonna turn these bad
[SPEAKER_22]: boys on first time they've been turned on
all together all those are on except that
[SPEAKER_22]: perfect we'll see what temperature they've
got it set to I'm guessing it's around six
[SPEAKER_22]: or seven hundred degrees as it usually is
and yeah we've got these set up to this
[SPEAKER_22]: Marcel piece here with the drop down we've
got the nectar collector here set up first
[SPEAKER_22]: time I've ever tried one and then we've
got the Marcel depi mothership fab egg
[SPEAKER_22]: with the drop down and the new D nail
titanium new titanium nail and then it's
[SPEAKER_22]: also they sent us their ceramic inserts so
if there's a bunch of ceramic inserts for
[SPEAKER_22]: the titanium nail and then they sent us
one sapphire so I'm guessing we're gonna
[SPEAKER_22]: bust out the sapphire because sapphire
super nice and should be exciting these
[SPEAKER_22]: guys are climbing up they're at two three
hundred now we'll see see how it goes all
[SPEAKER_22]: right catch you guys in a bit all right
guys here we are at the towards the end of
[SPEAKER_22]: 420 we just bumped into Horatio good to
see you buddy all right yeah you had a
[SPEAKER_02]: good time down there I'm sure yeah and it
was a hot popping day a good April 420
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah well I've been with Flav pretty much
the whole day I was with Ro for a little
[SPEAKER_22]: bit as well and we were earlier we were at
lunch and my manager actually one of my
[SPEAKER_22]: employees not my manager she called me and
said she would bring some stuff down for
[SPEAKER_22]: 420 and I asked her was there a package
from D nail and of course this triple
[SPEAKER_22]: threat D nail showed up the ninja nail
with the red gold and green D nail all
[SPEAKER_22]: three of them in the one case so we
thought we would light them all up we have
[SPEAKER_22]: three whips and they also sent me from D
nail one of the new nectar collectors with
[SPEAKER_22]: the D nail whip addition which anyone
that's ever used a nectar collector can
[SPEAKER_22]: definitely confirm that having it always
be hot is ideal so I'm not sure if you
[SPEAKER_22]: guys have seen this unit before but it's
the unit that you just literally dip right
[SPEAKER_22]: down into your product either in a glass
dish or I guess I've heard people doing it
[SPEAKER_22]: on oil slicks and stuff and then we have
the new titanium nail with the sapphire
[SPEAKER_22]: insert so why don't we just drop that in
there boom the nail is unseasoned but the
[SPEAKER_22]: sapphire is good to go and we're gonna be
hitting off the sapphire so I guess we've
[SPEAKER_22]: got some some limonene here and some this
was it rosin that I pressed out it was
[SPEAKER_22]: from here this is from 120 and that's from
45 all right that right and then we've got
[SPEAKER_22]: more of the LHO right here we've got some
of the Terps from that's from from Chi
[SPEAKER_22]: concentrates Chi concentrates exactly
didn't want to make a mistake on that well
[SPEAKER_22]: what should we start out with boys should
we do should we all do an LHO yes I was
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna say LHO with the nectar collector
I've never used a nectar collector I've
[SPEAKER_03]: always been sort of interested in one
would you mind breaking mine in dude it
[SPEAKER_06]: would be an honor thank you let's pick it
up for you there you go
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah he did the whole line he did the
whole line he did I didn't know it was
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna go in lines that was awesome that
was awesome worked very well you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: beast you're a machine I didn't know I was
like are we doing I'm like compared to a
[SPEAKER_02]: dab what's happening here do we do partial
lines is it called lines now is that wait
[SPEAKER_02]: a minute yeah that's what you drew out
maybe it's the way the nectar collector so
[SPEAKER_22]: is this how they felt in the 70s when
someone passed you the plate well I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: in a 420 special scenario well I said I'd
never be doing lines but I guess here I am
[SPEAKER_22]: LHO lines through the new D now nectar
collector collab yeah I'll hit it up
[SPEAKER_02]: all right got off that track about 75% of
the way there I was like don't go for the
[SPEAKER_22]: line that's really nice dude I have to say
that is a real nice experience he
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates in the house with us he's not
on camera but I think he'll have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: trying this too as soon as the camera
turns off absolutely you see it there
[SPEAKER_22]: mm-hmm excellent well that is quite a
little unit I like it there it is there it
[SPEAKER_22]: is and it lights up nice hey that's a nice
industrial stand like how gnarly is that
[SPEAKER_03]: right these are very similar to the kind
of stands that Brandon Martin puts a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of his pieces on the doll that I have is
very cool look at that it's all bearings
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really nice now I see how you did
the line that's really smooth does that
[SPEAKER_22]: come with this is this part of the actual
hole listen this not coming with a stand
[SPEAKER_22]: would be a nail in the coffin that's what
I'm saying fuck he's going back for more
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just checking it's one of those weird
things where I'm like what do I do do I
[SPEAKER_02]: work right to the you could like take a
glob put it right on your on your on your
[SPEAKER_02]: because if it was doing it inefficiently
we would see reclaim just firing up this
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's strange because I know my dab
limits when it comes to doing the lines
[SPEAKER_02]: but then I started doing swirls and
dancing with it and that's too much for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure well what's weird is I didn't cough
well you really whipped it up yeah and
[SPEAKER_22]: it's thick at the front so if you come in
there because I'm not trying to do exactly
[SPEAKER_22]: if you do half that line you'll be happy
happy camper half a line you know it's 420
[SPEAKER_22]: just do half a line Horatio well gotta say
that's my first hit off a nectar collector
[SPEAKER_22]: really stoked that I didn't have to deal
with the torch and that you know three
[SPEAKER_22]: unique beautiful pieces all hooked up to a
D nail showing the you know the sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: versatility the versatility yeah no it's
really good and I gotta say like I'm very
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed with the nectar collector let's
just turn that around so that cable stays
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah I think the D nail attachment is what
would make the unit as opposed to trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to like heat it up and get your
temperatures right I couldn't do that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't have gone for the second hit it
that was that I mean I'm actually
[SPEAKER_02]: impressed for never mind the line getting
me really high now and this will not talk
[SPEAKER_22]: of lines but you about to put some rosin
to work well I figure yeah we've got three
[SPEAKER_22]: rips here three rips of the rosin and yeah
I think if Dave just puts his hit on one
[SPEAKER_22]: side of the sapphire and I put mine on
another side and you'll will all three
[SPEAKER_22]: have a nice fresh sapphire rip fantastic
idea you've got the carb caps there so
[SPEAKER_22]: both of those will come in handy beautiful
Scott Deppie Marcel Braun mothership fab
[SPEAKER_22]: egg the radicello air trapping work really
one of my favorite motherships and then
[SPEAKER_22]: the Marcel air trapping Phoenix octopus
bubbler completely insane the Cory
[SPEAKER_22]: Cottenham down stem drop down sorry yeah
well the sapphire always no matter what
[SPEAKER_22]: you get off the sapphire it seems to hit
the nicest that's okay best to talk you
[SPEAKER_22]: know you got yourself a nice hotel room
and the last thing we want to do is find
[SPEAKER_22]: ourselves getting kicked out of it seven
sales Convention Center right there where
[SPEAKER_22]: the cruise ships come in we're literally
in the middle of downtown Vancouver
[SPEAKER_22]: probably in one of the most desirable
areas that you could spend a night or two
[SPEAKER_22]: if you come to the city to visit you know
beautiful North Shore Mountains in West
[SPEAKER_22]: Vancouver right behind us Lionsgate with
Stanley Park a view of the harbor and man
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you this is a good zone yeah
this is a really nice spot to be yeah it's
[SPEAKER_03]: been a really nice spot to enjoy our 420
actually absolutely I have appreciated it
[SPEAKER_22]: quite a bit go all right musical chairs I
think this won't we just come to yeah no
[SPEAKER_22]: problem Wow the sapphire is nice all right
here we go sapphire here we go sapphire
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah it's well it reminds me of a very
small piece only time I hit those really
[SPEAKER_22]: small pieces if you cut out most of the
oxygen and don't take too big of a rep
[SPEAKER_03]: mm-hmm like that many Carlson are those
little Marcel's that I have absolutely it
[SPEAKER_03]: off burns a bit just because the sapphire
disk is so fresh it
[SPEAKER_22]: sure is nice though
[SPEAKER_18]: well just cut my line a bit short well
I'll let you go there

Marcel octopus Phoenix Ratticello
[SPEAKER_22]: air-trapped ridiculousness with a drop
down in the D now which is truly something
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never even even when you said it
earlier I was like that'll be interesting

[SPEAKER_03]: there was easy 20,000 that felt like well
look I was on the other side yeah and we

was like yeah on a weekday I'm like yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 for 40,000 cuz it was no one was moving
your back up and it was where it was both
[SPEAKER_03]: the north and the south side of the
gallery because it was around oh both I
[SPEAKER_03]: still remember the first one 20 years ago
when I was 16 years old yeah I was there
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah 95 crazy yeah I do remember it I must
be a whole different thing a Renee it is a
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 bag rosin nothing crazy special but

you you want to get over here a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah let's give this full light let's give
this full right here this is yeah don't
[SPEAKER_22]: worry Dave's done this before awesome guys
awesome look at that that's how you finish
[SPEAKER_22]: 420 in Vancouver right there smoking out
of the icy Phoenix by Marcel Braun had
[SPEAKER_22]: some crazy adventures with this pipe you
know yeah we've taken we've been around
[SPEAKER_22]: with it's been around in the water it
comes around yes Whistler you mostly and I
[SPEAKER_22]: just happen to be there we tend to be we
tend to be traveling together so yeah if
[SPEAKER_22]: you want to come grab this spot she's a
pretty beast I have beautiful pictures of
[SPEAKER_22]: this pipe on Bowen Island dock that's
right man those photos well one of my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite photos ever is that one just with
me sitting on there on your boat oh yeah
[SPEAKER_22]: dude we're mad a cabin shot yeah a man in
his glass that's my personal title for
[SPEAKER_22]: that photo just in my own mind just Dave
sitting there so chill on the back of the
[SPEAKER_22]: boat with that pipe kind of like on his
side in his lap just like sure to the back
[SPEAKER_22]: of the boat
[SPEAKER_22]: I got one over here with our nature's
really nice I must say that's really is
[SPEAKER_03]: that what you did put my nature's in here
so this is some turps turp rosin it's um
[SPEAKER_03]: pink push rosin from my garden and then
Renee turps that she comes did you just
[SPEAKER_03]: dip it in yeah just dip it in yeah she
concentrates made the turps from Renee
[SPEAKER_03]: from my garden so everything is is pretty
much from my garden except the turps I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't make ah the turps we're going to
hit the turps
[SPEAKER_03]: big like I know there's a big push for
small glass like convenient I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever but big chuggy bubbler pieces do
this fuck school too for sure but they hit
[SPEAKER_22]: so fucking good of course there's like a
liter of water in here that's another
[SPEAKER_22]: people things people don't really realize
how much water is in a pipe like this a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge volume of water stabilizing it like
is it more sturdy of a pipe when water is
[SPEAKER_02]: in it then when it's dry like is that a
part of the natural balance that every big
[SPEAKER_02]: chuggy pipe like there's a liter liter and
a half type pipe fee but so for example
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah these two also this one has no water
in it but this is leather and lace by
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcel Braun and Jason Lee we've had it on
on Mark's show before she's a beauty still
[SPEAKER_03]: like such a wonderful chuggy pipe yeah old
school as well yeah but not you know still
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's there's still a decent amount
of water in there but not here it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful base on this thing like this one
which is a dykro and ready line Marcel and
[SPEAKER_03]: Dale Somers this one it takes you know you
put in the water to there it's not much
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like 10 ounces or 12 ounces or
something like that and it's not even
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe five ounces but and the hit on them
are just so good there's just something
[SPEAKER_03]: for me and it's you know maybe it's just
my preference you know Marcel straight up
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah that's Marcel Dale Somers Marcel and
Dale yeah isn't that a beauty I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: bring that one out very much it's been
sitting around you know all most of these
[SPEAKER_03]: just are sort of in the vault yeah that's
wild 18 yeah it's an older it's an older
[SPEAKER_22]: one anyway well that was a great hit
