bubble man's world I am here again with
[SPEAKER_03]: mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris Bennett, and today is today the
specialty of skateboarding skateboarding
[SPEAKER_03]: day Yeah, it's like have a few puffs,
but we're not really gonna be going on
[SPEAKER_03]: about a lot of different things We're
really gonna sit here have a few dabs with
[SPEAKER_03]: you and then we're gonna head out Chris
got a really nice New electric skateboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the evolved GT All-terrain I got the
all-terrain set up today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a street set up, too And then
we've got I brought my other two evolves
[SPEAKER_01]: the evolve with a bust and deck Street and
the evolve bamboo with the all-terrain so
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at Seymour Trailways demonstration
for us my favorite place to ride An eight
[SPEAKER_01]: mile paved road through the forest and
mountains best air on the lower mainland
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I agree and we're gonna hit some
Absolutely phenomenal quality rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah before we go out and do it and then
we come back from the street We'll do some
[SPEAKER_01]: all-terrain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah session the car and then do some
all-terrain I'm definitely down with
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing the camera and you know filming
whatever we end up doing This rosin is
[SPEAKER_03]: just so nice Found myself a wooden dabber
for today.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can imagine I'm hitting with a
wooden dabber, but I think we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to pull it off Give thanks to Dougie
for the baby cake Just don't hit it too
[SPEAKER_03]: hard you'll be sucking water, okay,
that's the gig Well, I'm definitely stoked
[SPEAKER_03]: that you are getting into this
skateboarding thing while getting into it
[SPEAKER_03]: You're deep in both feet like you are deep
into it And it kind of holds me with a
[SPEAKER_03]: foot in this world because I don't have
any other friends inviting me to go
[SPEAKER_01]: electric skateboarding Well, it's hard
hard in my age group to find people you go
[SPEAKER_01]: skateboarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate coming along dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always down It's kind of a long long
way to go it by yourself, you know Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: for sure for those of you that don't know
we are in North Vancouver Like Chris just
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned at the Mart's Mount Seymour
Parkway and these are pretty special
[SPEAKER_03]: trails It's like this beautiful paved
little road that just goes right through
[SPEAKER_03]: the middle of the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like eight miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never made it right to the end Wow,
and it's it's a good ride and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: turns and curves and the pavements really
nice and smooth That's awesome hills and
[SPEAKER_01]: gullies and all that type of stuff man,
then there's some really good off-road
[SPEAKER_03]: trails as well Just getting the dabber
here or the carb cap
[SPEAKER_03]: She may be a small little piece but I'll
tell you she hits like an absolute
[SPEAKER_03]: champion I am going to give you a more
reasonable hit this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I gave you a little bit too big of
one last time Yeah, I'm not lightweight
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not even about lightweight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about being comfortable with the hit
that you're comfortable with having and I
[SPEAKER_03]: myself who smoke pretty large dabs if a
friend loads me a dab I'll often get like
[SPEAKER_03]: higher than I would get if I loaded the
same dab So let's load you one up Chris is
[SPEAKER_03]: just like me when we get into this
situation the talking the puffing it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: good and fun, but let's get to the riding.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, man That's so great people
really enjoy these skateboard videos too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So You know, there's not I mean last one
obviously there was an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: good cannabis knowledge dropped But today
I don't think we're gonna be dropping
[SPEAKER_03]: quite as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna be dropping carves Maybe
dropping Since it got run over by a car it
[SPEAKER_03]: only lights at a certain amount The gas
has to be on a certain amount before it
[SPEAKER_03]: lights I lost it dirt bike riding on the
way up to Brom Ridge and I went by two
[SPEAKER_03]: trials And they both said they never saw
it and then when I finally found it I
[SPEAKER_03]: could see why they never saw it Because
they clearly had both driven over it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's still working pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see a little bit of marks here
Nice too shabby Chris is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: all right Good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay That little guy whoops parchment
paper don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the empty one Let it cool down a
little bit the beautiful thing about this
[SPEAKER_03]: tiny name Is that it cools down so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You certainly don't need a 45 second
cooldown or you will be getting the
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimate in in Low temp hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah The challenge is to not touch the
wood to the actual nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a hillbilly dabbing 101 Beautiful
be beautiful Well, I think a dab each is
[SPEAKER_03]: more than enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're both eager to go I'm gonna take the
camera with us on this ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy the ride guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Like the orange and the orange it's nice
Chris is rocking the brand-new evolve So
[SPEAKER_03]: there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there it is It's a beautiful piece of
machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie man for design,
you know, like just an industrial design
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing because it's such a sleep looking
machine Fast too, you know lives up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you turn it on at the bottom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one here you turn on the
bottom.

[SPEAKER_03]: Well it's hard to say much bad about these
electric skateboards They're really
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible They still get a little bit of
a workout You feel it in your back leg You
[SPEAKER_03]: can feel it in the ability or the way you
have to pay so much attention You really
[SPEAKER_03]: can't just stop paying attention on these
things They're fast, they're furious and
[SPEAKER_03]: you will bail hard if you don't pay
attention They are super, super fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: convenient and easy to use, to learn This
one works completely Look at Chris about
[SPEAKER_03]: to go over the gravel That's awesome So
this one that I'm on right now for
[SPEAKER_03]: instance is very different from the
boosted board Yet I'm feeling that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much acquired the sweet spot of it
Learning how to carve on it, learning how
[SPEAKER_04]: to go nice and fast It's truly a kind of
real cloud like I said Cause I bring back
[SPEAKER_04]: this music like this Man calls this royal

[SPEAKER_01]: Dibble dabble do Alright this This little
trick You think it's not like a hose and
[SPEAKER_01]: you point it in your face to show us
What's wrong with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude I'm already afraid of these torches
man Yeah, yeah Burnt me up You should have
[SPEAKER_01]: to have like some sort of a ticket for
being a dab Torch use and dabbing Now I
[SPEAKER_03]: got my dab ticket I got my dab ticket Oh
really how many dabs did you Like what,
[SPEAKER_03]: what, it's a 25 dab ticket I can basically
sit and operate a torch after 24 dabs and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still solid It's like damn bro,
it's impressive I like it, I like my
[SPEAKER_03]: electric nail myself Oh you rolled off
What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your stick rolled off Oh jeez I was
wondering what was going on there Look I
[SPEAKER_03]: caught it Without even touching the dab it
was sitting on my pants like that When you
[SPEAKER_03]: did that at first I was like I'm not gonna
even pay attention I just put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: hot things down I hope nothing's burning
Here you go
[SPEAKER_03]: Champion Champion So unbelievable ride by
the way Didn't even really mention that
[SPEAKER_03]: when we started filming again But that was
smooth and beautiful Really nice Looking
[SPEAKER_03]: forward to trying the GT I'm not gonna lie
I had one in the checker out a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: days ago on my computer I was like I
wonder if this is the one that Chris was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about I wasn't 100% sure I held
off Yeah I haven't even had the street set
[SPEAKER_01]: up on it yet I imagine the street set up
would be pretty sweet on this spot Oh my
[SPEAKER_03]: god dude It looks really nice I watched
the video I just like cruising through the
[SPEAKER_03]: city Does this one also have the lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: No it doesn't have any lights on it No
lights I've got a light at home I can put
[SPEAKER_03]: on it Good for a night time ride and I
guess you probably don't do much of it
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be kind of a night It can be fun
though Last year I was doing night shifts
[SPEAKER_01]: on Davie Street and then I'd ride the
seawall back at night and it was always a
[SPEAKER_03]: blast What about during the fireworks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah you know for sure That might be a
good time to bring the board into the city
[SPEAKER_03]: The city is gridlocked like 50,000 people
come to these fireworks from all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different areas around Vancouver and yeah
if you get caught in it it's a nightmarish
[SPEAKER_03]: hell but imagine being on an electric
skateboard and just whipping by all the
[SPEAKER_03]: cars and all the people and that could be
nice Yeah it's so nice here right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The air is just so fresh Dude look at
where we are It almost seems like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just a shitty little park but then you
look up and you're like oh right I'm like
[SPEAKER_03]: this is like epic back country It just
happens to have a little trail and an
[SPEAKER_03]: access point in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver is right on the edge of the
forest and then this road and trail goes
[SPEAKER_01]: into the forest that Vancouver is on the
edge of Nifty little kick of nature Get
[SPEAKER_03]: the city vibe out of you Well I live in
this very similar kind of experience but I
[SPEAKER_03]: would always want to come here more so if
I lived in the city as well because the
[SPEAKER_03]: city is a good vibe but it's like you said
it's good to kick it out of you every once
[SPEAKER_03]: in a while and get out into the mountains
Pretty amazing that you can do it with an
[SPEAKER_03]: electric skateboard That was a delicious
dab I got a low tempo and see how it's
[SPEAKER_03]: still kind of there This pipe is amazingly
resilient and the nail cools down if that
[SPEAKER_03]: was any other nail I would be so burnt
right now but it's barely hot now picked
[SPEAKER_03]: it up in Barcelona Spain from plant to
sewer I believe Little travel pipe Great
[SPEAKER_03]: little travel pipe and I've carried it all
over the place and kind of you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely not what I would call
cheap glass because I've tipped it over
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've dropped it and I've had it have a
quite a few different experiences over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years and it's still unshipped and in
perfect condition knock on wood Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully it lasts this trip Knock on
graphite There we go Well what are you
[SPEAKER_03]: saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we motor on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I'm not gonna complain and say no
Let's do it Oh yeah alright well I'll give
[SPEAKER_04]: thanks You know they say you was one that
with resources and in turn showing off
[SPEAKER_06]: your yearly budget but I'm not herbs
burner You know me Black Royal Tea I can

[SPEAKER_06]: you know say it have it love me sense And
make me hold the rems So hit me with the
[SPEAKER_06]: sense Breathe Man I'm herbs burner
Strictly sense
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright so now I'm on the brand new Evolve
and I can tell you it is absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: psychotic the GT mode is faster than fast
much faster than the busted from Evolve
[SPEAKER_03]: and the smoothness of the large air tires
is something that has to be felt to really
[SPEAKER_03]: be understood
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to the car I think it's over Chris
is like no we're pulling out the four by
[SPEAKER_03]: four boards and now we're taking the off
off-road boards out so you want to lead
[SPEAKER_03]: the way on this one Chris?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure This right here is some shit Electric
skateboarding on gravel roads First time

definitely one of the coolest things I've
[SPEAKER_03]: done in a while Electric skateboarding
Going to do some off-roading Looks pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: solid Clearly
