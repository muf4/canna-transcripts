[SPEAKER_09]: Hey guys, Bubble Man and Johnny B here on
a Happy Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've gotten down here to the CCHQ,
the BCMP, whatever you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I guess we got the second floor vapor
lounge, private?
[SPEAKER_09]: Private!
[SPEAKER_09]: We opened it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We opened it, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have got it all set up, but we
wanted to take you to this beautiful
[SPEAKER_09]: little place called La Tacoria that's
right across the street.
[SPEAKER_09]: Phenomenal, phenomenal tacos with the OG,
the jaritos, the sauces killer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about the puff that is not
sweetened with sugar, but sweetened with
[SPEAKER_09]: sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say the cane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, I'm just blasted right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having fun here, you know,
that's what we do on a puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's head over to La Tacoria and get
some tacos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B, Medi One, on the medtainer.
[SPEAKER_09]: La Tacoria, this is the spot right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, La Tacoria, so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait, I'm so happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, this is my favorite place ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it, let's get in line.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even a lineup, you like that?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about to get a lineup, it's for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're fantastic, we're really hungry.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're filming our little TV show that we
do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I grabbed some quesadillas with the
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it mushroom and kale still?
[SPEAKER_09]: Which one's the tiga?
[SPEAKER_09]: The spicy one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I've been waiting for that one
for so long.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, let's take an order of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll grab a vegetarian taco,
or sorry, the tuna atun.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one frijole charros.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want four?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm going to do two tacos and one
quesadillas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you're looking at?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we just talked about?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to get one?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to get four tacos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get a beef, chicken,
pork.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look at that, now here comes all the
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: One beef?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: One chicken?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: One pork?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One beef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fish guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try the fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do all four.
[SPEAKER_02]: The atun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing all four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do all four.
[SPEAKER_09]: John.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I also get a mango jarrito.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going for mango.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a mandarin jarrito.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing the mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mango for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know why this is the legit?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you've got the killer tacos,
the music, and the jarritos.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the people, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: The killer people.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the best place to eat.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's the jarrito, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm in Jamaica right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I'm in Jamaica at a Mexican
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're awesome, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just feel like Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the atun tuna taco.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little mushroom and kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at these ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: with the winning plate.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's definitely a win.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to grab these little horses over.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a little soft.
[SPEAKER_09]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Winning.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to eat this down and we're
going to head over to the BCMP and have a
[SPEAKER_09]: mad session off Wednesday styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cut this one in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making a duel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B.'s going to town on those tacos.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to beat La Tacorilla.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that was amazing, John.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's head out of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the heavy fucking glass they
have in here?
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got heavy glass in this taco area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that acid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's head over and get our session going
on Puff Wednesday style.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just weed everywhere in this
block.
[SPEAKER_09]: More weed when we've got Crosstown
Dispensary doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder who that could be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stashtastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_09]: But mostly because I don't know him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't hang out down here too often.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have been coming down here for 20
years.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to go grab it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooking us up with private access into the
lounge.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got their little dab bar set up
right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pot TV.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we're going to be set up in the
corner here today for a little Puff
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can always play games when you
come down to the CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got all their little zones.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is where Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: and I are going to be hanging out today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get this Puff Wednesday started.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good yummies.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to be able to see what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just came up with that right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's our new thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to copy Remo.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to point and signal.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great tacos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jaritos.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a little sesh, didn't film it,
ran over, had tacos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm squishing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no rosin this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to kind of get things ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, what's that shwaggy weed you
got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a jar of weed that came out of the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like four months old.
[SPEAKER_09]: I save stuff that I can't eat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like.
[SPEAKER_09]: You like the flavor of it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to squish to be a tasty
treat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've kept it fresh with bologna.
[SPEAKER_09]: While Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: is squeezing out the rosin, I am going to
hit both of us up with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_09]: West Coast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful color on this untouched SFV OG
90.
Micron.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got a single gram of it right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can just see that it is absolute
fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we're going to be dabbing,
turpdip, bong ripping, fuck yan on behalf
[SPEAKER_09]: of our brother D420K.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not with us today, but with us in spirit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for that Jamaican sour diesel
because it just tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gifting you some in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: needs some turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need some, not just any turp,
some Jamaican turps, some CRD turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty awesome, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Double dipping.
[SPEAKER_09]: So our plan today is to have a little
session here at the CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been really nice enough to give us
this entire floor privately so there's no
[SPEAKER_09]: music playing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no people in here, whereas
upstairs the music's banging.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's tons of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're playing pool.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, God bless them or whoever your
idea of creator-ism is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spirituality, bless them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you want to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: John, bless them.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: For doing it and coming and hanging out
while Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: literally squishes the rosin next to me as
I'm about to dab this lovely, lovely
[SPEAKER_09]: little bubble hash dipped in sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the things I've been doing
lately is I have been heating my banger
[SPEAKER_09]: way less than usual.
[SPEAKER_09]: Heating it barely at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny's kind of tripping out because he
just did that squish where you get nothing
[SPEAKER_09]: and you're like, what the fuck just
happened?
Nothing!
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe let it get a little hotter.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the wrong side.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the wrong side.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be loud.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll heat this up for a few seconds and
we'll have a nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a 10 second heater.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, we don't have to heat it
up for a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you need to clean it,
you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you burnt the shit out of it,
you need to burn everything off.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a real small little banger you got
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Little 14 or?
[SPEAKER_09]: Little tiny guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks even smaller than 14.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine's a 14, but it's a giant banger.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yours would go inside mine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa!
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like dipping.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bangerous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're definitely going to have to bomb rip
this little blossom chip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe you just got nothing from
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: It used to be my favorite squishing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think maybe it being in the fridge for
the last three months has changed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something is just weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to discuss that though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, maybe we should.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should find out if there is going to be
a difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm taking a look at that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really super stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have to heat mine up now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what's wrong with me.
Do
[SPEAKER_08]: we have a banger for you yet?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that a no?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I can get you one.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't have one now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me sort you out, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm being sorted.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_09]: Friends got other friends' backs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even as you were heating that up,
I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I sort something out there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Something's going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we want you to get properly
dipped.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dipping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I waited a little bit longer on that one
because it's a smaller area.
[SPEAKER_09]: The trick with this guy is it's such a big
surface area.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get these perfect, perfect low
temp dabs on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You notice how perfectly clean that is and
how mine is completely destroyed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers your dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: People cheer beer.
[SPEAKER_09]: They do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm like, cheers.
[SPEAKER_09]: He and I did it one time with our
motherships and it was like, never again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Never again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do the banger all day long.
[SPEAKER_09]: But not the mother?
[SPEAKER_09]: The mother is like, ooh.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty good to go with that.
There
[SPEAKER_09]: you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Through a nice little hippo piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well played, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The taste, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me want to hit another one right
away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what else are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish you guys, you can try the Jamaican
turpentine furniture rub.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're definitely available on Blue River
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although they did chop us up at the knees
on our Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue River Extracts Canada is now gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I may try again and register Blue River
Extracts CA.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about just Blue River Turpdips?
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue River Turpdips.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to let people know what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the problem is with the Instagram
and with all of these platforms,
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, right away when you're trying to,
I see a lot of the accounts being shut
[SPEAKER_11]: down from branding and trying to get new
products out there and the way that things
[SPEAKER_11]: are being pushed on certain these
platforms.
[SPEAKER_11]: And really all it takes is one person to
say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like him.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: So one guy ruined it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's amazing how those platforms work.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one more reason not to be mean and
nasty to people on the internet because
[SPEAKER_09]: they just, you know, it's that one guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be like, I'm going to go out
of my way and make your life miserable.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a little bit miserable to see how
that goes with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first don't squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try, try again.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was something that smoked out of
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a little bit of smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that too.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: Must've missed a little area of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks perfect, but.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is nice and moist at least.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like John said moist.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: These, these low temp dabs, you can take
them real quick after heating it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more try on the weed that's being in.
[SPEAKER_11]: The freezer for four months in a jar with
overdub used to squish quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure you've seen the squish in
the past and now, now I'm putting full
[SPEAKER_09]: force on this sucker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Used to squish quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure you've seen the squish in
the past and now, now I'm putting full
[SPEAKER_09]: force on this sucker.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking that smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The taste is so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's just like, I got that little.
[SPEAKER_09]: How clean it was too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like just, yeah, it's hard to explain the
taste on those, on those beautiful tip
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the Jamaican sour diesel is tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making me nervous over there
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, I didn't get anything from
that last time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it was weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've got it on an angle and I squished
it wrong and you can see it squishing on
[SPEAKER_02]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get a squish on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely, I'm having no luck here at
all.
Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero luck on the squishing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me load you up another six star.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm firing it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me load you up another six star.
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened there is I squished the
older.
[SPEAKER_09]: See what I did?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I squished half.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure like I'm saying, I'm happy to
just sit here and smoke the literal shit
[SPEAKER_09]: out of all of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B's having some problems today.
[SPEAKER_09]: He might have to give himself a Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's happening right now,
I was trying to do a squish on the go and
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I've eaten numerous chips.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty crunchy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing like being bummed out,
trying to squish something and not getting
[SPEAKER_09]: anything out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It happened in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time Tony and I were there,
it was substantial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me load you up my piece here for your
dad.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a brother ship made like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you right now it's not the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks the same, but I don't think it's
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a nice way for people that
aren't going to ever, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: invest the money into the actual mother
ship to still be able to get something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really, really enjoy the ball word
groups and just the difference in the chug
[SPEAKER_09]: and the difference of the hits on the
different pipes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you really start really
realizing what hits you get.
[SPEAKER_09]: The hits you get are the hits you get,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that low temp dripped right down
the middle?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, is that really nice looking?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a wower for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: See that last hit that you took?
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd literally decimated it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It moved right out of the circle and
started moving all around the pipe,
[SPEAKER_09]: hitting like a champ.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I call a well turned riff.
[SPEAKER_09]: The way it just sat right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really, really wish that we actually saw
that up close because that would have
[SPEAKER_09]: worked for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even we were kind of like, wow,
that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can make a video.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, afterwards I'll just time lapse
that sucker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's slow motion, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Slow motion.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was, it was pretty cool on just
watching the difference between the low
[SPEAKER_09]: temp dabs and then hitting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it dropped right into the center of
the quartz dish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it never made its way.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just went into the edges.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it sucked back up and went into
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It boiled lovely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of when we look at those new
bowls that do it for trickings,
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's kind of working in a similar
way, how it's drawing up and dropping
[SPEAKER_09]: back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's just all these different
things that people are thinking about
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you think about what we just saw.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well that was the directional.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how he decided that, guaranteed,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone putting a carb cap on and kind of
moving it around, moves the oil or the
[SPEAKER_09]: melted hash around in a circle.
[SPEAKER_09]: So something I really didn't even think
about until right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make a video for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, I think we really should
get to the park.
[SPEAKER_09]: The sun's shining.
[SPEAKER_09]: The blue skies have come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're going to head into West
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to check out one of my
favorite parks, which is Lighthouse Park,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is a park that requires a little bit
more of commitment and an investment of
[SPEAKER_09]: time before you get to the water.
[SPEAKER_09]: White Cliff, very quickly, we were at the
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one, you walk through a big forest
and we'll be able to potentially stop and
[SPEAKER_09]: have a couple of sessions along the way
before we get to that end result.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going on a bit of a hike.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going on a bit of a hike and we're
going to have a drone and we're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: have these cases, tripods.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be kind of like one of
those hikes that's like, damn,
[SPEAKER_09]: we have a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should get someone from the viewers
that help us hike this stuff up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, if anyone is local and
wants to come help Bubble Man's World
[SPEAKER_09]: sometime for filming a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just having someone carry stuff,
we'll gladly dab you right out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I was just thinking I could see
the hundreds of emails that just came in.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more dab each.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just really enjoying this hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, it's a beautiful flavor,
especially with the turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I dabbed it in the same turps each
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine's dried up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine came from Toronto.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see me quiver?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the orange cream?
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite as a kid was getting those
orange creamsicles with the vanilla ice
[SPEAKER_11]: cream in the middle.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was my favorite thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to me, a creamsicle when I was a kid
was orange.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wasn't until later that I saw other
colors.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was purple and green.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just like, holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get different colors?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I just used to call them
creamsicles.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is definitely orange creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's your dab, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit hotter than usual.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I heated that up more than 10
seconds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put your hand just above it and you'll
feel like it's almost burning.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want your hand to burn because
those turps don't need to be burned at
[SPEAKER_09]: high heats.
[SPEAKER_09]: They sure change drastically when you hit
them at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole purpose, not to say changing
them is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be part of the experiment
you're doing in the bioassay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure there's things to be found in
that aspect that are of value.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for me, I love the preservation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love getting it as authentic as it was
given to me by the plant in the first
[SPEAKER_09]: place.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we looked for extraction
methods that are.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're pretty good to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just touched it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just puddling on the bottom of the
quartz right now, spinning around the dish
[SPEAKER_09]: and bubbling and melting so beautifully
that really only the bubble hash and the
[SPEAKER_09]: dry sift of the highest quality do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get that same bubbling from
rosin or any type of oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a foaming from rosin,
but it's not like that bubbling,
[SPEAKER_09]: bubbling, bubbling, bubbling.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's quite different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this will clean up so perfectly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not in a rush for John to finish his
hit like I am sometimes if it's been hit
[SPEAKER_09]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it's like, I really just want to
clean that off the quartz as soon as
[SPEAKER_09]: possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: But those low taps, it's such a beautiful
flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's really those turpeys that
you can taste on the under your lips.
[SPEAKER_09]: The flavor, it's like, it's like when you
have a creamsicle, you have that flavor at
[SPEAKER_09]: the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: You finish that creamsicle and you're
like, mm, that was so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, mm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm going to join you with the
creamsicle if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, please.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little creamsicle joining.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned something new today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always been calling into my phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always like call, you know, pay by
phone, call, wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: What he means by pay by phone is the
parking in the city in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a fairly sort of pretty cool
system here in the sense that you can use
[SPEAKER_09]: this app.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, before the app was the call,
the phone in number, which is what he's
[SPEAKER_09]: been doing up until about an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told him, just download the app,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the app and then you can just
punch in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every parking space has a number.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you, for cities that don't
have it, I used to get so many parking
[SPEAKER_09]: tickets when I came into the city.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I don't get them because my phone
basically sends me a text right five
[SPEAKER_09]: minutes before the parking is going to
expire.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, it's a great place to come and hang
out and relax.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got like the top of the place we were
just at.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at the lineup.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's out the door now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Out the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the great places to walk across the
street and eat while you're puffing heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's been a, well, there was a
remembrance day celebration today right
[SPEAKER_09]: across here is of course the Centennial or
whatever it's called, Centennial Park.
[SPEAKER_09]: Centennial Park it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why they were all there today
doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really good to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, over the next few days we're going
to be remembering our veterans and the
[SPEAKER_11]: ones that lost their lives fighting for
what they believed in and the cause of the
[SPEAKER_11]: believe in was fighting for our freedom.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a very big thing that we fight
for every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: We fight for freedom for this plant every
day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's another big fight that we fight
for every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Different freedoms that we fight for and
people have lost a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been thrown in jail and they've lost
loved ones and lost lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: People have lost lives fighting on the
front battle believing in the cause that
[SPEAKER_11]: they believe in is fighting for our
freedom.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's different ways to remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: Children have lost parents.
[SPEAKER_11]: And parents have lost children.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's a great day to remember
though.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, remember the one who fought and
the fight was won.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that can be a little wrong,
but I mean that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always know that you mean well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you say something like that,
even if you messed up the words a little
[SPEAKER_09]: bit, it comes from the heart and we get
what you're saying, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: So bid on you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go do the paw.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get out of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's come, let's bring you guys along
with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow man, set up the machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of strain you have there?
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is so clean and clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab,
[SPEAKER_04]: dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course he did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course he did.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but people have to make it their
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at this big guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I say we stop this right now and have a
dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, careful of that giant horse shit at
the entrance.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just throw the chairs down right here,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's have a dab at this big monster
tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are, but this is the first one and this
is the one that we're going to be dabbing
[SPEAKER_09]: it up at.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We made it guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've pulled off to the side of the trail,
literally three minutes into the trail.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had five or six conversations.
[SPEAKER_09]: A few people from Argentina and Colombia.
[SPEAKER_09]: One person from Colombia and another
person from Argentina who we just talked
[SPEAKER_09]: with for probably half an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really cool people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Education is the key.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were cool people.
[SPEAKER_09]: She said he was an author.
[SPEAKER_09]: He writes about content.
[SPEAKER_09]: Consciousness and such things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's gone into more of the DMT
psychedelics, you know, great,
[SPEAKER_09]: great conversations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course it was good conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also say, so let's hit some Kush
cleaner because it's just fucking
[SPEAKER_09]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: See how that works.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Torch me buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: This has got to be probably this tree
behind us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to look up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's like, it's totally ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget about pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: The dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love this like 10 second heating
of the nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, give it a go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold it up against it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Up against the dish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lower is better than higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny's getting the uber uber beautiful
low temp dab on that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of what we're going for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure that I got the.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I do have them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Q-tips in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll be an easy one to fill.
[SPEAKER_09]: You did drip a little bit on your jeans
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me clean that up for you partner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super low temp, but that had to be
delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at the dip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually got a little drip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't let it go away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't let it go to waste.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so I'm holding the cap.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got the dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to be hit next to this monster tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got these guys right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have them there in our crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it that you're here to witness what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's kind of fun when we're able
to take on these adventures and show you a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit of beautiful BC.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we have a nice flight with the
drone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these trees are so epic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to be able to show you guys
what they look like from the air.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see what they look like from the
air.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven.
[SPEAKER_11]: Eleven second heat on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, now you're going to see this
dabbing of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: So really it's just a quick heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was holding onto the carb cap for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to keep it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how it says bubble man on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's a Marble Slinger classic.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I recognize it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He gave me 10 of them and I gave them all
the way to customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a customer out there that got
one of these, leave a comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stoked that you got one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a picture, send it to him with you in
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, yeah, I got one, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be pretty epic because it's part of
memories and what we share and what the
[SPEAKER_11]: culture does is we share and we reminisce
about the good times and the awesome
[SPEAKER_11]: things that have happened because of this
amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we just pull over on the side of a
trail and blaze next to a monster tree,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's probably five or 600 years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you a couple hundred.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people you think have sat here
and smoked one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably half about as many dogs as have
come here and taken shits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they've done that too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can see that people stand here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This gentleman right here walking by has
been doing a nice little bong rip,
[SPEAKER_09]: turf dip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't be the same without all the
literature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I will say that that was not a
woman.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I say man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Woman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I say woman?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's go back and we'll find out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can tell us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Either way, both of John and I are really
not worried about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, give it up to this tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: What a fucking awesome dab sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's head down and get that drone in the
air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just sitting back here.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going down this way because John's
being a little bitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, John's not being a little bitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's being a pretty big bitch,
actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just joking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm caring.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm caring.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's working it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's working it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just having some comedy here off
camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we thought we would turn the
camera on and give you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_09]: that ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just passed a big old tree just full of
agaric on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Seven Sister Trail and Shore Pine
Trail.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to find another good spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's an uphill battle, though.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a trail.
[SPEAKER_12]: The trail kind of went around and went
down.
[SPEAKER_09]: This seems like we're kind of on a river
bed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They went the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, even the dogs went the other way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Without the water?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the shortest way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Takes us to the water and we can do a
little drone flying and a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have puffed those people down
from Argentina and Colombia.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would have been fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would have been nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would have been nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just trying to shift all my packages I'm
carrying here.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We take you guys on adventures.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to put some work into this for
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can't all be fun in games.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use the Argo and get there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, we would get some looks if we came in
here with the Argo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd be tripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would call somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would not be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would definitely be chased down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool if you could design an electric one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you want to check out the barred owl
path?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not walking up to the top of that
tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this looks inviting down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have to walk back down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to go on your back and just
pull your feet up into the air,
[SPEAKER_09]: you'll probably slide all the way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_09]: See if I can actually... Actually ride the
chairs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop, drop, and roll.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop, drop, and roll.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear water hitting this... Hey,
this is a pretty cool mushroom.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right here, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful little mushies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at all the mushrooms we have right
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I see them all along this whole log.
[SPEAKER_11]: All along the whole log.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you've got a certain number of types
of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to know all these mushrooms,
but I forgot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can always relearn, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so Johnny B and myself are...
Oh, I'd say close to the water now,
[SPEAKER_09]: probably two-thirds of the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that 15 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B is not much of a hiker.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to go short pine or Seven Sisters
or Solemnberry Meadow?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're definitely doing the short
pine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Short pine it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Such a nice little... It's beautiful,
actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate the walk, the big
rocks, trees, the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's beautiful, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Fall and...
[SPEAKER_09]: In British Columbia on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_09]: All these fallen trees just look pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, look at that little cubby hole
we're heading into.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we go to the view?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hike Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hike Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, the view is over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it says view.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're walking back up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Top of the morning, John.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is definitely a place to puff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just this flat rock alone is perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it looks like Johnny B is a little
bit behind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a left.
[SPEAKER_08]: He caught up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go check out this view that they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I've been this far over in the
park in a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where there used to be a camp
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have these cabins and such that they
rent out to the movie industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and there's the lighthouse right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the lighthouse park.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what makes it lighthouse park,
so I think we're going to have to get the
[SPEAKER_09]: drone out and fly from right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we set up the chairs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived here my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been here before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I'm setting up a chair and doing
a dab and hanging out at the lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happiness.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is the lighthouse, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lighthouse there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: The shining landmark.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can put those chairs down right here,
brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's all these cabins.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of want to put my chair right on
top of that up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get it up there and I'll film the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You film the whole thing, me falling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: The helicopter.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the new surgery.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be visiting you in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty much surreal shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not if I'm already saying it's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put my chair right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put the chairs down safe.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a little concerned we have some wind.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't know what's already going on,
we got this happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's checking his sensors.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got that going on right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting ready to launch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right beside it, of course, is the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: The chairs are set up for what?
[SPEAKER_11]: For us to dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to bring you the shots
that you guys want to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't forget, we hiked in here for 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going right for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out he goes into the wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you guys go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gave you the footage that you want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking an overlook at what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the trees moving back and
forth there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see how it's kind of busting
into the wind like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really some truly drone footage
here going on, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be watching this as I'm
actually zooming out because now we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going over the lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just testing it out and seeing if I get
back okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now we're going to get a little
daring.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got that black cloud over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heavy wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking it to the no extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little bit of unzoom there,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're watching that footage right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming back from that epic view they were
just watching right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
That thing flew hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you guys go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like that you got her in the hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what happens there,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that footage you just saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bit of wetness on the drone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well we are deep in the bush
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Heading up to another lookout here in
Lighthouse Park.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just showed you the lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Up close and personal with the drone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Little bit worried.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of windy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we didn't give you what I would
call the greatest drone footage ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a little bit weak to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: But hopefully we'll get some better stuff
up here as I drop my tripod.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B for the win.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a crazy little path.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to almost not be a path.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow, John.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're going to like this spot,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think we found the coach there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, this is what this is like.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you can walk down a couple of
drops and there's a spot down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another spot up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: More killer spots over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at the rain across the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's trippy that there's no wind and
it seems like where did the lighthouse go?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's drop these chairs here in the warm
spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the drone out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: A good spot so they're both safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be flying the drone over him right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lighthouse Park is a trip that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you just go the slightest little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see how much it changed?
[SPEAKER_11]: So the drone, you can see the footage.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be seeing it there, but
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say a couple of bond rips with the
drone is going to be essential.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was some epic stuff that we just
witnessed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was good, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's have some dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just talking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about this chair behind us
is roughly about a 30 foot drop.
[SPEAKER_09]: But beyond that, it's probably 60 more
feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: To the water.
[SPEAKER_09]: To the water, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was a little nervous there because it
was just a little bit half the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I not make the offer?
[SPEAKER_09]: I will take that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very dangerous right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always accepting of keeping Johnny B
safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: We keep it real for you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: As safe as we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done some really fun drone flying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of was a little nervous.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was windy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've shown you guys a couple of clips.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we might have a few more
sessions in the forest because we don't
[SPEAKER_09]: feel as quite as rushed.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I figured we'd at least have this epic
ocean view.
[SPEAKER_09]: Vancouver Island behind us with the rain
and the sun shining through the clouds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a perfect time for us to sit
right here, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull out the six star.
[SPEAKER_09]: West Coast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull out some blue river terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just thinking, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: The terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a whole bottle of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me try this just for a little.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was super random, but let's hit that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the 10 second heating up of the
nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just a new, like awesome,
awesome, awesome thing for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you see that dip?
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you, did you see that?
[SPEAKER_11]: That was like, cause when you go into a
bottle of terps like that, it's more than
[SPEAKER_11]: one dip and you're going to realize that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you get your terps, some people,
they go through really bad and they will
[SPEAKER_11]: get, cause you follow our lead and you dip
in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would actually use the dropper,
put it dripping and drop it onto your
[SPEAKER_11]: product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing that lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Even to like a couple of grams,
like just a single drop.
[SPEAKER_09]: I whip it all around.
[SPEAKER_09]: I add a little rosin to the bubble hash
and then the terps and it's quite a lovely
[SPEAKER_09]: product.
[SPEAKER_11]: See the thing is, is the terps,
they're essential that you use them
[SPEAKER_11]: properly because they will last.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hear some discouragement like,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like dipped in there like four times.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you soak your rosin into terpenes,
it's more than one dip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a soak.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can count it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One drop, two drop, three drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you got no drops left.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to hit this one a little extra to
make sure I clean off the residues.
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't go the full like hardcore.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was just my Terp little talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your Terp little talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked your Terp little talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you didn't fall off this chair to
your death.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about the helicopter
landing and then you guys see me get my
[SPEAKER_11]: new surgery.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're coming in with different terpies to
see what helps my pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead we're going to do like go out on
your own.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: The Argo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Argo.
[SPEAKER_09]: And go have fun on that level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not like anyone dying or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait because the steel truck is
going to take us to the most carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cap a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cap a friend in need.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of capping.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people don't understand the carb
cap and why you carb cap because if you
[SPEAKER_11]: don't, you're just not really going to get
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: That extra little leeway giving us like
puffing on a bowl.
[SPEAKER_11]: You give a little hand tap to keep the
bowl going.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have it, you should try that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give it a little tap-a-roo.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little tap-a-roo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little tap-tap-a-roo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tap-tap.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was delicious and perfect animation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super low temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect though.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really like quite surprising.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the sun just went down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then raindrops keep falling on the
hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been one of those days where every
kind of three or four seconds you get a
[SPEAKER_11]: little bit of a I might rain kind of drop.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has been just like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure you saw it in the drone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Little stalls while you're flying out
there over the epicness behind us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty cool sight to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to be happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually quite fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of giving you a turp dip,
what I did there was called a turp water
[SPEAKER_09]: board.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got quite a bit of turps in this rip
coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm taking the glasses off for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that again?
[SPEAKER_09]: The turp water?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was turp waterboarding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like turpentine torture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually see that this house used
to be really nice, but now what's been
[SPEAKER_03]: sulked has completely changed color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get one made like this that just
says Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or JB.
[SPEAKER_03]: JB.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to talk to the girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that is one of the bonuses of dating
a glass blower like Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: He can talk to the girlfriend,
get something blown.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't mean that in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a great way.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all that's going on here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, keep pushing that in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got more hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got this down pat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puffin bowls in nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tasty as hell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take the fun out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tasty as hell.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can go right out on the rocks down by
the water if we walk a little bit more to
[SPEAKER_09]: the left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is where I usually go where those
people are right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also a nice little spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw it flying with the drone.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could have taken them down even closer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great that you guys get us out on
these Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_09]: We missed a couple there when the camera
was broken, but we got it happening now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the dual cameras with time lapses.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the drone footage.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take some macro videos and photos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw them into this video and Puff
Wednesdays should be a substantial
[SPEAKER_09]: improvement from the regular videos that I
post on my channel.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that every video you post on
your channel has substantially a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bit more than the last one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's a learning experience and I'm
definitely by no means a professional.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just came at this as a total amateur.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have fun and as long as there are bowls
to be puffed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let me clean that for you,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was busy talking.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really learning because me myself,
I've ruined all my quartz bowls because
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm always hitting it because for me,
I'm always hitting it hard and hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's still a good idea every once
in a while to go in and just give it that
[SPEAKER_09]: clean up, which is what I'll do right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the clean up rep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just from those little bits that are
smoking each time, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_09]: quite see the little bit of residue that's
on the side, but it's not enough that it's
[SPEAKER_09]: going to oxidize the nail up all bad,
but it's definitely the beginning that if
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't clean it up and burn it off,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_09]: It ends up being done like mine,
but you can always buy another one too.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're pretty non-expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it depends on the company you go
with.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there are a couple hundred or 150
for a Quave banger.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a Quave 150.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the DC glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's around 100, 150 as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the Puking Bee Quartz 1 beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puking Beagle were awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we paid 300 for those.
[SPEAKER_11]: That one got disintegrated after hitting
it with heavy torches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, that was Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sapphire, Sapphire, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember you saying that happened to
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the one where they put the D-nail on
the bottom and somehow I...
[SPEAKER_09]: I did a rim.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of trippy because it wasn't like
that at all today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anywhere we've been, but when we came
around here, I first felt it on that down
[SPEAKER_09]: lower spot and it was very light,
but when I got up to here and walked
[SPEAKER_09]: through here, right as you were saying,
oh my God, it's so warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's this rock that's been
baking in the sun all day or what it is,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it feels good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely a warm and the wind's
hitting that rock and it's warming up the
[SPEAKER_09]: wind and it's blowing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like vacation time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is like vacation time.
[SPEAKER_09]: With you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what do you say, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's next on our adventure here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think we're going to take you guys
that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Into the park.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or out to the coast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we might not even take anyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: We might just say, hey.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're making no promises.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no promises.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to smoke some more hash
probably off camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, let's do it on camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: 80, 100 years or however long these trees
have been here for.
[SPEAKER_11]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Straight ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we found ourselves in the middle of
the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some communication there with a
little bit of wildlife.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little wildlife communication.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the side of a trail.
[SPEAKER_03]: People walk by here sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be surprised if they did.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not concerned either way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's the trip this pick right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going and looking for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll hit the Cherry AK-47.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking for the Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking for that Jamaican Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cherry AK-47.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bit in there anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's old.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can get a couple of squishes out of
there for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we got like a 420 on a Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: 420 on a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always nice to spend with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoying the scenery, the wildlife,
the enjoyment of the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Showing you epic views of the coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of those shots were just like,
it's stuff you only see in the movies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, of course, on Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty nice stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of people out there filming
with drones nowadays.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of famous YouTube vloggers that are
putting out some pretty quality content.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just cleaning the dish if you haven't
already sort of figured that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looked like it wasn't cleaned very well
after the last dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we might as well just fire it off and
get it nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way of getting it clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of keep it up and running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it up and running.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta keep that shit up and running.
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta keep it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready for a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you got one on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: You even dipped.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm dipped.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dabbed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Loving being in the forest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I love this shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Being surrounded by huge trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some big ones in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, huge for the city anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not out near the ancient cedar
forest where the trees are 20 plus feet in
[SPEAKER_09]: diameter.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are still pretty big.
[SPEAKER_09]: He is going to maybe come to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: For the cannabis cup there in December.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm kind of hoping on working on
getting Ron to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if he does, man, I'll tell you,
I'll be so excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: So excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be more like a minute
wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really have been liking those 10 second
waits.
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we count down, five, four,
three, two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's getting close actually.
One.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was counting dabs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we are outside in the wilderness.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have that warmth off the rock in
that corner where we just have a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bit more chillier inside of here actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, got a great dab with there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to hook him up with the Q-tip
because that's just the way of being able
[SPEAKER_11]: to keep that thing good and golden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not golden, I should say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it's quite tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I'm an apprentice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's things that you do, you know,
you got to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you learn this and work.
[SPEAKER_11]: You learn how to make sure you have the
right tools for the job.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of times we forget water or a torch.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always something.
[SPEAKER_09]: A battery.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did pretty good today.
[SPEAKER_09]: A charger.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of figured this.
[SPEAKER_09]: A remote control.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forgetting the remote control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that one was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one where we did the,
well that was going sitting on the dock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was another beautiful shot when
we take a look at the way the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: coastline looks and how it is just so
close.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 10 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get yourself a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get yourself a dip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's Cush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the OG.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like white widow or something or
no ACVC.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have white cookies.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's all sorts of shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: To make a sour diesel is so tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, hit whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the one I was looking for when
I found what I found.
[SPEAKER_09]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love these getting into different zones.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having a little puff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having a little conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoying the environment and enjoying the
moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that you guys get out as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't maybe have the most epic
coastal rainforest to walk through,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because even in the center of Canada,
the prairies, there are some beautiful
[SPEAKER_09]: forest trails that you can walk through
and do mushroom collecting and just have
[SPEAKER_09]: an all around blast in.
[SPEAKER_09]: These forests are all over the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all different and they're all to
be enjoyed really.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: That corner one is the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get you ready here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the swoosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: The swoosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: The swoosh.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love hearing all those birds.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all wishing me a happy 420.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still a really nice low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why it took me so long to
figure this out, but I guess that's how it
[SPEAKER_09]: goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Too impatient to wait one last one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think next down the line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next down the line?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been enjoying every stop that we've
made, every little conversation we've had,
[SPEAKER_09]: every dab we've done, every drone we've
flown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're picking up on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've enjoyed it all, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've enjoyed it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even right now listening to the birds and
potentially insects chirping all around
[SPEAKER_09]: us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's random too because we are literally
on the trailhead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on the trailhead.
[SPEAKER_09]: The main trailhead that takes you in and
out of this park.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw dozens of vehicles when I went in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We bumped into probably 15 plus people and
for whatever reason, there's nobody around
[SPEAKER_09]: right now, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just keep sitting here for a little
bit and we'll hook up with these guys when
[SPEAKER_09]: we hit our next zone on the way out of
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so as always, Johnny B has
pointed out that it is 420, just after I
[SPEAKER_09]: put the pipe away, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have pulled out the Omicron pen from
Uptek and I've got it packed full of some
[SPEAKER_09]: rosin and some bubble hash and some terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's our 420.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy 420, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, I want to miss a 420,
especially on a puff Wednesday with you
[SPEAKER_11]: guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was like, it's 420 and we're getting
a little puff in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we're, you know, we're trucking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Weather says rain.
[SPEAKER_11]: We say, you know what, we're getting out
of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: A 420 dab, you know, a little 420 mini
rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: So not bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's head down the trail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's head her down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_09]: A woodpecker or whatever that is up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably just one of the branches breaking
off.
[SPEAKER_09]: As we're standing underneath it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can easily spend hours in this park,
walking this matrix of trails that go from
[SPEAKER_09]: east to west and north to south.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's quite a nice size acreage of park,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostly all coastal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And wouldn't you say after today,
John, it's one worth exploring here in BC?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, a thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one of the beautiful, beautiful
spots that I've never been to.
[SPEAKER_11]: In BC and I've lived here basically my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty close to the city too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's really nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, people are kind of missing out,
but I guarantee you guys are going to come
[SPEAKER_11]: by here and, you know, and you're going to
tell us more about your little trip here,
[SPEAKER_11]: here in the area.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty, pretty nice place to take
your girl or somebody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we head down the trail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's head her down.
Okay.
