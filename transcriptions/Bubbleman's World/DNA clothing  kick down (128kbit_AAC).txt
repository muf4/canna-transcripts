[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to do a quick little thank
you to the family over at DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both Kim and Aaron sent a little care
package over and I wanted to open it here
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the Bubble Man's World cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure to spend time with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were of course here for New Year's
towards the end of Christmas into New
[SPEAKER_00]: Year's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went and all spent time up in Whistler
together so that was an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they said they were going to send
me a little care package and indeed they
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this looks like a little sticker
package right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Circular red, gold and green DNA stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, 10 year anniversary, also red,
gold and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my favorite color schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Kush DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys got MAD stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reserva Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provada.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA Army Worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks for the stickers guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I tell ya, my DNA case is about to
get stuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of the dab mats that they had given
me last time they were here and Aaron gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me like five of them and I ended up giving
them all away almost instantly so thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for sending me a few more guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muchly appreciated on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray hat, I'll tell ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my kids spilled orange juice all
over my other one so it was kind of ruined
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was really getting used to wearing
this one so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be well, well used in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check this tee out guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Box out of the way a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that tee shirt right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just super, super sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't be complete without a,
I kind of call this the Don style.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Don always has one of these cool
shirts on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always kind of admire them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the work shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice green button up shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be sporting that in style for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: See a day where I can get a variety of CRD
shirts made up like that because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a shirt in there for my
wife but I took it out and gave it to her
[SPEAKER_00]: already so wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a really nice treat to receive all
these sort of gifts from you guys and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to take a dab in your guys'
honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the unity in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice to be, to have come all this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, spent 10 years in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last 10 years with DNA and I've
watched them absolutely destroy the
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take over the game in a big way and
it's exciting that through UCAN we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be working together in the future
so we'll see what kind of projects we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get into with future opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so what did I break up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke up some D420K OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the Quartz Puking Bee Bowl and the 2.0
D-Nail going strong in the Fab Egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much guys.
I will leave you with unity in the
community.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
