[SPEAKER_00]: All right, wait a few seconds here until
we get sorted out with everyone coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As promised, I've got some red Congolese
terpenes with a little, well, a very
[SPEAKER_00]: little, but I can show you a bigger piece
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Congolese bubble hash rosin,
which I can assure you is of the utmost
[SPEAKER_00]: highest quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really been loving this right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna be sad to see this last little piece
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I hope everyone's doing great
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't sure what to sort of make the topic
about today, what kind of things we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello there, Lisa and Dustin in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is awesome, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely ridiculously awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've dipped a little bit of it into the
Congolese terpenes, the red Congo
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that missed it,
that's what we're puffing on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we are puffing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see the reflection of my
computer screen on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Ron, and welcome Fletcher Archive
in the house, Chris Gamble and Zach Aiken.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan Muchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, morning from Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I need to take this rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been using my sick dish as my
carbon carb cap on my sapphire,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it works quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gets a little hot after a short time,
but gram dab, my God, not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing a huge giant dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be quite enjoyable, I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it on, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo bubble hash rosin, actually,
Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash was squeezed into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what we're puffing right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Cameron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're enjoying yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gonna come for a visit one of these
days soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the Congo by itself,
I love the exotic flavors of those terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, that terpenaline, that is that
sort of hazy, piney, and exotic smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenaline, let's just say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start dipping into terpenes,
of course, that changes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know for those of you that have
been trying out the Blue River Terps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they really do change the end result
of the hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it in your lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful, tasty thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, good morrow, Michael Manning
and David Poderski Cannon, Flav421 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've had 25 people react to our
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, I don't even know what that means,
but I'm just glad that you guys are all in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got about 100 people probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wearing my whole plants frozen shirt
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Aaron, for turning me on to those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sneak previews on topics for Nest
Church you can let us know about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am trying to get my friend Sunil
in, who's a very brilliant doctor and
[SPEAKER_00]: talks all about the cannabinoids,
the endocannabinoid system and the
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-cancer properties, and he really is
putting out information in a way that is
[SPEAKER_00]: as solid as it could be possibly put.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've been trying to get him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that he's going to be on for
episode 102.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure would be nice to have him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be nothing but a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Dr. Natasha will be showing up
and sharing her time with us and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the regular panelists,
along with maybe something or someone new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every week I want to put the energy into
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could be really making Hatch
Church a thing that I was putting a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: time and energy into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that sweet skunk dab that just
came off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just had to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some sweet skunk right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how reflective it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelic almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he sure is, so I'd really love to
get him on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he would be a great addition,
that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should you send your resume in
regards to going on Hatch Church?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Trey, I know nothing about that
except what Todd has told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think of him as a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay out of things like that,
but obviously Todd is my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me that a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never felt like it was my responsibility
to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously if something like that
happens to you in life, it's a touchy
[SPEAKER_00]: subject, especially if someone is in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hush, hush, hush the way he has
quite been for a long time, or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: finally say, hey listen, this is what's
going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people in this industry
would appreciate that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, who knows if it's ever as cut and dry
as he said, she said, but having your
[SPEAKER_00]: voice on a 911 tape definitely does not
sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome Christopher Cole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not stopping, just not stopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to go for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet's going for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, Brandon, I did hear,
that's terrible news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to hear that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird that they're choosing certain
ones and not choosing other ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they would get off the,
it's such a tricky situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have, it's money, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ability to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the reason we all started
selling pot in the first place was to
[SPEAKER_00]: escape their system of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to be a slave to their money,
you know, you're not able to do the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the beginning for me,
as I learned about cannabis as a young
[SPEAKER_00]: person, and I was working hard shitty jobs
and double shifts and gas stations and
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing, I sort of quickly
realized that just finding great herb and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing it with just my circle of friends
is a wonderful, beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that grew obviously to the point
where I felt like the whole world was my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and I wanted to get it out there
to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's really what it's all
about right now is that profit margin,
[SPEAKER_00]: because obviously Canada has said that we
can have this, people can grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: people can buy it, people can,
you know, now can we sell it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the last sort of right that we're
waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mark Emery did a really beautiful
interview recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys go on my Facebook page,
and it's not the most most recent post
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did, but I will go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I posted it just yesterday and
it's definitely worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five minute interview with Mark and
he basically says, hey, listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the people that have been that
have been torturing and harming people
[SPEAKER_00]: over this plant for the last 50 plus years
are the same people that now want to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's utter and complete
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should they have any say in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, which I really loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello from Barcelona, Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says that people who don't smoke
cannabis should have no say in where
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is sold because it doesn't affect
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only really affects people that are
buying cannabis where it can be bought and
[SPEAKER_00]: sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was a brilliant point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on my page and it's just a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a few things down right below the
honey bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see Prince of Pop Mark Emery on the
future of marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, they should have used the word
cannabis, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how many of you are going to come
meet me in Toronto at the Karma Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've decided I'm going to get
behind Sarah Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's put a lot of hard work into this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that many Canadian events that
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toronto's rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place where I can link up with
a lot of people from Ontario that I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to through Hash Church and through my live
Facebook's, as well as people who live
[SPEAKER_00]: just across the border, whether they're in
New York or whether they're in even as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as Massachusetts or wherever, just pop
right up over that border and come check
[SPEAKER_00]: us out October 23rd, October 22nd and
23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out at thekarmacup.com or
thekarmacup.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: One or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did saying cannabis instead of
marijuana become a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, serious juries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it became a thing when we read
Jack Herrera's book The Emperor Wears No
[SPEAKER_00]: Clothes back in the 90s for me,
91, 92, 93.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by 94, 95, we started realizing that,
you know, a lot of this, the use of this
[SPEAKER_00]: word marijuana stems out of like a racism
and a hatred of black and brown people,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see it if you go back
and you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really... Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Spanish word that suddenly people
were saying in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it definitely was not used in a
positive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that because it was this
certain agenda that tried to make cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: look so bad, turned cannabis into
something different, which was marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drug that would make you crazy or end
up, you know, making you do crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't use the term that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the term cannabis for all of,
whether it's industrial hemp or whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, high grade recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's been a thing for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a long time, 20 years, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure for other people,
maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just really depends on if you come to
grips with that sort of hairy and slinger
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda and how it stems out of racism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, I don't know, Trey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sooner than later, I would like
to think I have so many things going on
[SPEAKER_00]: down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like events in the States?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Stephen, it is going to be a bit of
a festival, more so than just a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously she wants to have,
you know, the glass blowing community.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to have vendors with a little
village that you can go through and shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to have educational seminars
like Hash Church and these live Facebook's
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's invited myself and she's invited
Normal Canada to try and organize as many
[SPEAKER_00]: good people, doctors and patients and
growers, et cetera, processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: To discuss all the different things that
we love to discuss about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things that I'm quite
excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on Steve-O-Law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out from Winnipeg, Manitoba,
my hometown.
[SPEAKER_00]: East Kaldonan boy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raised on Bowman Avenue, right off
Henderson Highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually moved to McLeod, close to the
number one highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's going to be cool,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony might end up being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he's going to make it,
but I will be there for certain with
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes in hand, doing the terpene bar
and the terpene taster booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do people still call it a drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess because drugs are
plant-based medicines that we use to heal
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the, you know,
the fact that the plants that we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: could be considered to at least have drug
content, based on what we define as drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't like the term drugs,
where it turns into a sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're not calling it
pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calling like cocaine and heroin
and methamphetamines and cannabis drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm definitely not down with that
myself, but what do you call it if not
[SPEAKER_00]: drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them, you know, essential dietary
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both essential amino acids, as well as
phyto-cannabinoids and terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that have healing properties,
have incredible properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to call them a drug,
that's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying I don't like the term
drugs when trying to put down illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: substances over legal ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly, Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's derogatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when you say drugs, it sounds
derogatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it really depends, like anything,
what the energy and the message behind how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my terps from the Blue River
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the process of actually going to
be producing our very own Canadian Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: River terpenes here in the very near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you would say to someone in a
quick convo?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you've noticed,
Jeff, but I don't really have quick
[SPEAKER_00]: convos.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, hanging out on YouTube or
Facebook usually lasts an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hash church goes for four hours at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give people time as much as I
can anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to admit I have very few short,
short conversations in a day and many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many long ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have a favorite mushroom strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I have a favorite mushroom
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all sorts of favorite mushroom
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with my favorite one to
pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locally here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the cyanescens, which are called
the wavy caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow usually on straw, or they grow
out of grass, depending on what's
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's got to be wood chip for them
to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them all over the lower
mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Ken Johnson?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shroom, shroom, shroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got to love the shroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to have you safely in the States
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even in Texas in a couple years when
we can build a giant... Dude, I'd do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish I could come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on there, Ken Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the wavy of the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an umbrella cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used to pick them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, they're not the only
ones I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love semiline seattas, which are a
simple Liberty cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strong, very fun to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very wonderful vibe when on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love baocystin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baocystins are a little bit more rare in
the sense they contain baocystin and
[SPEAKER_00]: norbaocystin, which are chemicals that
definitely seem to produce hallucinogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce almost, for me anyway,
cartoon-like hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different from any other mushrooms I've
ever really taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushrooms generally for me aren't that
hallucinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'll see things quickly happening
in shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I take enough, like over five or
six grams, which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really like a hang out with
your buddies sort of dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've seen, you know, flowers and
plants growing out of my chest and other
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty intense things that weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them scare you, Craig.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll show them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll reveal yourself to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really will teach you so much if you
allow them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a deep respect for the mushroom,
no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Kohler, why do I recognize that
name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just write on your Facebook post
the other day, like randomly just nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: off, but basically everybody who read the
post?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I remember that name and I
remember reading a Facebook post that said
[SPEAKER_00]: something about kiss my ass or something
along that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me think of the vageties of
Facebook and how people will post these
[SPEAKER_00]: vague things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, you need to like explain
exactly why you're saying that and direct
[SPEAKER_00]: who you're saying it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this on YouTube, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, maybe we will, Robbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of turned sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like to turn it the other way
for a YouTube upload, but maybe I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, DMT is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dimethyltryptamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrence McKenna really turned me on to
the DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also turned me on really quite to the to
the mushrooms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that haven't listened to
Terrence or read his books, I do urge you
[SPEAKER_00]: go check out True Hallucinations or The
Invisible Landscape, which he wrote with
[SPEAKER_00]: his brother Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also like to sort of,
you know, tell people to listen to his
[SPEAKER_00]: very various talks that he did at the SLM
Institute and other different places in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah, it might not have been you,
Casey, but man, it was someone telling
[SPEAKER_00]: someone off without saying who it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see it on Facebook all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go, you know, post down and see
something that someone said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's like, man,
am I now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I supposed to want to know about this
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're trying to pique my interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome, Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Robert, I am going to be trying to go
back to Jamaica next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of things to get done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some exciting things to talk
about soon, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the talk about whipping the
motherboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure what that is,
Mitchell, but you can let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archaic Revival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Archaic's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, Trevor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was always the Beo systems that
could get me there, but never just
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried to friend you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, I have like 5,000 friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way we still you will see
everything that I post.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I always tell people,
even though they seem to be disappointed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't see what they post.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, if you're not following,
like imagine 5,000 people follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I didn't know how Facebook
worked initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just click accept, accept,
accept, which made me their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started seeing the most fucked
up shit come across my Facebook feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, Whoa, like who the fuck is
posting this crazy shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started having to delete people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank God for different sort of social
experiments they do in the news,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, they'll post.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will allow themselves through news
stories to unveil their own racism or
[SPEAKER_00]: hatred or nastiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that made it very easy to go
through Facebook and lose a ton of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those of you that want to be my
friend on Facebook, I suggest just follow
[SPEAKER_00]: me, you'll get all the information and
it's it's better that way for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dhaka, scary dark outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems it's someone knocking at my door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened but nothing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's midnight here in Dhaka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Society makes folks this way sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also social media, which is a social
experiment on its own self that we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, actively engaged in currently
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Giuseppe Giuseppe CK Galantucci.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a solid, solid Italian name right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people do seem to be angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Trump was just one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I allowed the Pokemon Go Trump videos of
cops arresting, beating, killing,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that shit, like all the shit that
you're super upset with in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not saying that you should sweep
it under the rug and not expose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, at the same time,
your social media feed is what you follow
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow to be shown in that feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's I don't think it's a good idea to
have that much negativity just buzzing all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and making you think a certain
way and making you react a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my simple reaction was to unfriend the
people that posted all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was at five thousand for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what I'm at anymore,
but it's definitely like four thousand or
[SPEAKER_00]: three thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually forty eight hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, am I accepting people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was only a couple of a couple of
hundred people that were driving me
[SPEAKER_00]: insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should have another dab before I
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you join me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you join me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome, Todd Young, Pablesag in the
house, old school buddy of mine from from
[SPEAKER_00]: way back, really way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty years, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dab is for you, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got my Pablesag shirt,
but it fucking got a super stain on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't get to wear it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never brought myself to throwing
it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my OG Pablesag shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I hope you guys are taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, should we have a turp dip here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we should have a turp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should have a turp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry AK-47 for the Wisin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry AK-47 profile for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of goodies in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out at BlueRiverExtracts
.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I don't know Joe personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is kind of a random, like Joe would
have to want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we could never ask Joe of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem that, you know,
you can't just go to people like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, it would be great if you used
all your traction and your awesomeness to
[SPEAKER_00]: like expose my much less traction show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he'd have to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he saw it and he thought, you know
what, this is something I can get behind
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about and I think what these guys
are doing is good, I'm going to help them
[SPEAKER_00]: out, then awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if that's ever going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we're just going to
keep chugging along, hopefully making the
[SPEAKER_00]: right choices because the internet is very
reactive and all it takes is one bad
[SPEAKER_00]: choice and all of a sudden people turn
their backs on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as we can keep sharing
information and people can keep learning
[SPEAKER_00]: and bettering themselves, I think that's
what they show up for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think they're showing up
for any other reason than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my opinion is not that ignorance is
bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had these arguments years ago
when I stopped reading the newspaper and
[SPEAKER_00]: the media, because these stories are
manipulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, they are happening, but it's like
back in the day, who was it that stood on
[SPEAKER_00]: the corner in Compton in California and
showed about statistically how murder rate
[SPEAKER_00]: had gone down, but the way the media
portrayed the murder rate in the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had gone up like 800%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although less people were being shot,
the media was showing more of the stories
[SPEAKER_00]: when people were getting shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I'm saying is don't let the media
control your thought pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean you have to be ignorant
because nowadays we have many more sources
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to for news, but we just have to be
careful if we just take our social medias,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were originally used to take down
regimes like in Egypt and like to show to
[SPEAKER_00]: expose corruption, but you just continue
to repost the same old CNN and NBC and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these other different major news outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really not getting anything other
than the same news they've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it is too hard to
believe and understand that the media is a
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme form of manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a huge piece of the puzzle right
now when it comes to disseminating out
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda to control the masses through
their particular agendas, which is have
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke lots of cigarettes and drink
lots of coffee and drink lots of booze
[SPEAKER_00]: while working many, many hours as a drone.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the experiences they want us in
and it's no surprise that in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry you see a lot of people that are
trying to escape that, just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: escape that and cannabis kind of gives us
that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came across it and the
ability to sell and trade it and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: few dollars and although that prohibition
profit turned out to be to come with a
[SPEAKER_00]: large karmic debt and good people ended up
going to jail and being busted and having
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives destroyed, it still is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you dig it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Michael, if it happens, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never ask Todd for that, but if Joe
Rogan and Todd did that one day or Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to come on Hash Church,
I think it would be amazing to say the
[SPEAKER_00]: least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like his audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that he's a smart guy and he shoots
the shit and he talks about interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: things and people, they hear when he's
talking and the people that he brings on
[SPEAKER_00]: his show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't watch it a ton,
the few times that I have watched it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been quite enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real people having real
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not, but I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not fish off my boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really a fisherman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of friends that are
fishermen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have special boats for fishing with
everything you could possibly have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my boat is a competition ski and
wakeboard towboat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mostly just have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crank the stereo and we puff dabs and
we pull people on the wakeboard,
[SPEAKER_00]: wakeskate, wakesurf, skis, kneeboards,
the odd time of tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm puffing on some Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: This drop down was made by Corey and it is
absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be able to see it, but right on
the top, there's like a phoenix in the
[SPEAKER_00]: millie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it'll hone in on it
properly, but it's a really cool phoenix
[SPEAKER_00]: that spirals out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can barely see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of you coming and
sharing your time with me as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that you guys have better things
to do with your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll go shave this kind of getting
out of control beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, have a great day, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's a wonderful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my sister's birthday today,
so wherever you are, if you want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: happy birthday, Jeanette, Bubble Man's
sister, I'm sure she will get the message
[SPEAKER_00]: through the ethereal vibrations that you
put off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
