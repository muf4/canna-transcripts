[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're recording, so let's hope this works.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's hope this works.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to the inaugural episode of
Hashtalk, first episode ever on this
[SPEAKER_13]: Friday 420.
[SPEAKER_13]: We should probably get our bombs going
because we don't have much time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to admit a few people into the
room.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are going to smoke because it is
420, so welcome everyone who made it for
[SPEAKER_13]: 420.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pretty good group right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can everybody hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's have a 420 hit to start the
ceremony, shall we?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, super stoked to have you all here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Best Friend Farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Dammit Bobby.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Flav421, the Dank Duchess.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Scott from Taste of Cascadia.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got the Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we got Hua.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hua Extractions is in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so a little bit of noise for
the beginning because, hey, we can't start
[SPEAKER_13]: a 420 show and not have... Yeah,
sorry, I had to light a joint,
[SPEAKER_05]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, dude, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, light that joint, light that
chillum, light that bowl.
[SPEAKER_13]: Blast that banger, whatever it is that you
prefer to do, because we are here to talk
[SPEAKER_13]: about hash today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of people have been bothering me
over the years.
[SPEAKER_13]: When is Hash Church going to talk about
hash?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll admit, we do go off on some pretty
crazy tangents.
[SPEAKER_13]: The focus on this conversation is going to
remain hashish related.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are going to talk about all things
hash today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have three to four hours to put
into it, unfortunately, today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to drive up to Whistler here in a
short period of time, probably an hour and
[SPEAKER_13]: a half maybe is what I could probably pull
off.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to mute everyone that is not
muted because that makes it so much nicer
[SPEAKER_13]: in my ears not to have to hear all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my banger is ready.
[SPEAKER_13]: So here we go, first show.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I should share this in the other
YouTube chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll just put that in there so they can
all come see us over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's hit it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, it's going to be quiet when I'm
taking a rip because, well, it's the one
[SPEAKER_13]: time I can't talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's get right into it, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going into a big introduction.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get heavy ice in here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got someone else coming in under the
name iPad.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: What does that say?
[SPEAKER_13]: That says, what's up?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what's good?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's good, what's good?
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just starting this first episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got some new folks in the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kush Kirk is in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's good, brother?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you what's good right off the
bat is Instagram is good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Instagram has brought the hash game to a
place where it really needed to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: We started in caves practically.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got onto websites eventually like
Overgrow and Cannabis Culture and Cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: .com and CannabisWorld.com.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was kind of the late 80s scene where
you could trade this information.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Instagram really blew it off the
hinges, being so mainstream of an app.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really how I met the majority of
you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked Instagram to tag hash makers that
would be worthy of a pass.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we did a little hash church last Sunday
and I felt like we really barely,
[SPEAKER_13]: barely tipped the iceberg in the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Started going and we squeezed out all the
people who were coming in for the rosin
[SPEAKER_13]: panel, which we're going to do a hash
church down the road for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it really showed me how much of this
conversation is still really urging to
[SPEAKER_13]: happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel that there is a, almost a
reemergence of hash making of solventless
[SPEAKER_13]: extraction, if you will, even though it's
the craziest misnomer of a name for us to
[SPEAKER_13]: use.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the misnomer we use.
[SPEAKER_13]: Solventless is what we call, I guess,
petrochemical extraction free,
[SPEAKER_13]: whereas water is the universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hydrocarbons, which make up the terpenes
of the plant and the building blocks of
[SPEAKER_13]: all the cannabinoids are also solvents
themselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to stay mildly scientific in the
terminology.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where we kind of are accurate with the
words that we're using, but at the same
[SPEAKER_13]: time, I understand that we're still going
to sometimes call the cultivar a strain
[SPEAKER_13]: and sometimes we're going to use the
terminology.
[SPEAKER_13]: Solventless, I don't think it's the worst,
just a little bit of a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've got a bit of a list here,
guys, in regards to kind of conversations.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wrote a little bit about, I mean,
as a hash maker, if you're the grower and
[SPEAKER_13]: you are finding the cultivars and you're
finding the phenos and you're using your
[SPEAKER_13]: olfactory to find that terpenes,
your protein profile, and then you're
[SPEAKER_13]: actually growing it, producing and
creating the inputs to grow that plant and
[SPEAKER_13]: then washing it, well, I mean,
what can be said?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just, you're a rock star if you're
doing all that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the full meal deal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a full appreciation and a
respect for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of hash makers are not that,
and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do have to sort of pay attention to
probably the most important thing as a
[SPEAKER_13]: hash maker, because the quality has
already been taken care of for us,
[SPEAKER_13]: if we're lucky.
[SPEAKER_13]: All we really have to do is isolate it,
which the process does very, very simply,
[SPEAKER_13]: which becomes then our only job really
becomes to dry it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure many of you have seen in the
years of drying cannabis, you can take
[SPEAKER_13]: beautiful cannabis and dry it incorrectly,
cure it incorrectly and ruin it and really
[SPEAKER_13]: drop it down multiple grade points.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel the same is true for hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought, let's start out the
conversation today with drying,
[SPEAKER_13]: whether you guys want to talk about
sieving versus microplaning, whether you
[SPEAKER_13]: want to talk about air drying versus
freeze dryers, I'm down for whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought that would be kind of a
good starting point as it's probably one
[SPEAKER_13]: of the most important things as a hash
maker.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not doing all the other things
that I mentioned, the drying is probably
[SPEAKER_13]: really the most important aspect of what
you should be paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally agreed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone got any thoughts on how to start
that conversation?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually going to say I got some
hand dried hash right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's like such a funny story about
it, like where it almost died out on my
[SPEAKER_08]: part, where just the people that are
purchasing, you know, like they just want
[SPEAKER_08]: the freeze dried because of the look,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the hand dried is such a traditional
side of it that I don't want to let go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And keep it like, keep it around is
really, I think important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it shows that somebody doesn't need to
rely on like a machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, having a machine is good and all,
but one, I mean, there's just a skill when
[SPEAKER_08]: you can use your hands to do the same job
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it goes to show that somebody that
does do it obviously is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_08]: like passionate about it and dedicated to
the craft a little bit more, which also
[SPEAKER_08]: says a lot too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm always a little bit funny about
making any comparisons about who does
[SPEAKER_01]: which in whatever way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I air dry, I definitely do a freeze
drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a freeze dryer from the beginning in
2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for a super long time for
some of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it does, it indicates
any more, I wasn't more passionate about
[SPEAKER_01]: hash making when I was air drying than now
that I'm freeze drying or when I go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to air drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an irrelevant part of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's really important is I
myself, I, you know, based on what I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of hash from a lot of
different people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last week, Marcus, you mentioned that
when you had told people mistakenly,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know, roll up the hash,
a lot of times people were rolling up hash
[SPEAKER_01]: wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm seeing where this
freeze dried people are very much using
[SPEAKER_01]: very small amount of numbers for their
hours for drying, as if that's making
[SPEAKER_01]: their hash any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, I let shit sit
out, because I want to know if I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to write about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of stuff that's just not
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you air dry, and you're doing
some kind of seven to nine day process,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you live in Colorado and it's done in
three days, or you have your freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_01]: tech dialed in at the end of the day,
as long as you're putting out good
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, good recreational, whatever you
want to call it, as long as it's dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it will be good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you do it is no way indicative of
what you care about.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the like how the resin was grown
has a lot to do with it too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything to do with it on my in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just when when when Kirk was saying that
it kind of reminded me of like,
[SPEAKER_13]: I get asked about macro photography all
the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do I do my macro photography
handheld.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe some of you don't know that maybe
some of you do, but I don't use a rail
[SPEAKER_13]: system.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't use a tripod.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like build this giant thing that
I'm pushing a button to move my camera
[SPEAKER_13]: half a millimeter at a time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of that, I feel that that
skill is a real value to photographers to
[SPEAKER_13]: learn before they get the rail system.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I kind of attributed to Kush Kirk
saying what he said in a very much like I
[SPEAKER_13]: understood what he meant by that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, yeah, there is something about,
you know, not all of us are selling hash,
[SPEAKER_13]: first of all.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not all not everyone is just making
hash to sell it to people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of us are just hash makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just went.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I think I got bombed.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, truthfully, Kirk, you know,
I don't have any issue about passion,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm saying we have a tendency to
divide ourselves when we're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I do it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this way is better than that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, we all want to
provide good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people who are watching are
watching by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't love the plant more than I had
bursitis in two shoulders from an injury
[SPEAKER_01]: from 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't necessarily mean anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes, you know, I do believe I do
believe that we should display skill no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at every stage, don't rely on any
crutches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be able to like make hash in the
bushes as long as we can get some ice and
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those who have decided to go through
the machines, especially when you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: large, large batches, I don't think we
should look down on them at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know looking down on anyone can
relate and say that, like, when you push a
[SPEAKER_08]: few buttons, it's a lot easier than doing
it by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I tell a lot of the people that
asked me on Instagram how to do it and all
[SPEAKER_08]: this shit and the tech and this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, honestly, you've got to
learn to, like, do it through losing a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I've lost a lot of, yeah,
that's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't really learn just by getting
shit handed to you on a silver platter
[SPEAKER_08]: these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: By no means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they run into obstacles all the time
that make them be like, oh, wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, you don't understand the
fundamentals in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you only understood certain cultivars
in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why when something came out
totally different, you just didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: People got to open up their eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the plant before they even start
working with it on a detailed level like
[SPEAKER_08]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody really does.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all just jump to zero to 100 real
quick and try to get that money.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just don't think that sometimes
people necessarily do take those steps
[SPEAKER_08]: that are required.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that will make you I think not
just a better hash maker, but more
[SPEAKER_08]: knowledgeable of the plant and more
understanding and not get frustrated when
[SPEAKER_08]: shit don't go right or some shit,
you know, don't blame somebody else,
[SPEAKER_08]: like the grower or something, you know,
like there's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I like I like the idea of being able
to finesse the resin through a sieve by
[SPEAKER_10]: hand, you know, observing everything
you're doing and just like observing the
[SPEAKER_10]: resin throughout the drying process.
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously, like you said, there are
times that, you know, when you don't have
[SPEAKER_10]: the process down the path that it gets too
warm in the room or too humid in the room
[SPEAKER_10]: and something happens to the resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of interesting to see,
you know, what what happens and obviously
[SPEAKER_10]: change that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to microplane, but I like the idea
of finessing it through a through a sieve.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, yeah, I would agree with that as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have always loved sieving the hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: Microplaning was something that we kind of
discovered when we allowed really high
[SPEAKER_13]: quality hash to gum up and goop up before
it was properly sieved, allowing too much
[SPEAKER_13]: water to wick out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we would freeze and we would
microplane.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I remember kind of doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll never forget the day the
conversation started like, well,
[SPEAKER_13]: isn't that shredding the heads?
[SPEAKER_13]: This was just right around the time macro
photography was coming in and people that
[SPEAKER_13]: were doing it were like, no, no,
it doesn't shred the heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first time I photographed a
microplane head, I was shocked at how
[SPEAKER_13]: shredded and flayed it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it made me understand immediately
like, well, here's this one more thing
[SPEAKER_13]: like fresh frozen microplane your hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: These are two ways to acquire what I like
to call foam mount.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your shit won't melt if it's dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you need to well, let's run it fresh.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we'll save some turps that will give
us that melt, that glossy look,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's like, oh, well, maybe maybe
if we microplane the heads, when the flame
[SPEAKER_13]: hits it, all that resin will be already
outside of the head and appear to be
[SPEAKER_13]: meltier than it actually is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I'm not saying all microplane hash is
that I've seen six star get microplane
[SPEAKER_13]: that drips into a liquid and, you know,
drops right through the tightest of
[SPEAKER_13]: screens.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will say that a lot of people have
taken into account the fresh frozen and
[SPEAKER_13]: the microplane hash to give them an
appearance of a hash that's maybe a little
[SPEAKER_13]: bit better than it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, jumping in on that just for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's always good that new people
are coming into hash making.
[SPEAKER_01]: People should be making their own medicine
top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like super believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, in the last year,
I have to tell you, I have met so many
[SPEAKER_01]: movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about people who haven't done
a single run and they're making their
[SPEAKER_01]: first first run fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just feel like somehow just the
instant clout is like just messing with
[SPEAKER_01]: their head or something because they don't
understand that fresh frozen can be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, they are putting a
lot of money on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I wanted to get that instant
clout and be able to flex like they've
[SPEAKER_01]: done something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They jumped in to do this fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, this is for me not about cured
versus fresh frozen because I'll do both
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just feel like people should start
off with cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, as Kirk said, you have to
be able to be willing to lose a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, like lose a lot of shit in order to
be good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'll tell you the funniest thing
when fresh frozen happened, because I was
[SPEAKER_13]: right in the middle of it all.
[SPEAKER_13]: People going from using dry material.
[SPEAKER_13]: People loved bubble bags when they use dry
material because they got real returns.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now they're using this shit that's
really four times its weight in water.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so like you're lucky to get a three or
a four or a five if it's really great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas, you know, like when you're
pulling that actual five in dried
[SPEAKER_13]: material, that is a twenty percent yield.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let me tell you, when you pull that
out of a 20 micron, 20 gallon,
[SPEAKER_13]: like 90 micron bag, there is something
beautiful about that that just can't be
[SPEAKER_13]: that just can't be compared.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the first hash I made was all bone dry
material.
[SPEAKER_13]: The first full melt I ever made was from
bone dry material.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now it's not really known in the world
of making hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people are constantly asking,
is it possible to make like, can you use
[SPEAKER_13]: dry material?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, of course, you can use dry
material when it's been grown actually
[SPEAKER_13]: like baller style and the genetics is
super on point.
[SPEAKER_13]: That resin shines regardless of whether
it's fresh frozen or and I'm also like
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe I'm old school, but that whole fresh
frozen thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I get the importance of it for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the very terpenes we cured out
of cannabis for decades.
[SPEAKER_13]: We cured them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we smoked it, it wasn't caustic
and harsh.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now it seems as though when people
take dabs, they're looking for a caustic
[SPEAKER_13]: harsh dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just my opinion, I see it a lot out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was gonna say that I agree with
that, that the cultivar, as far as the way
[SPEAKER_07]: we do it is air dried and into a slow and
patient cure on it to kind of let the
[SPEAKER_07]: resin speak in terms of its terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, when it comes to how loud it is
with the terpene profile, we know the
[SPEAKER_07]: resins there and we'll take the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I feel like the cured resin
bubble hash really speaks truth for what
[SPEAKER_07]: the cultivar is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of fresh popping,
zesty, terpene heavy and really isolated
[SPEAKER_07]: in the fresh frozen state, which I do a
little fresh frozen work also.
[SPEAKER_07]: But our majority is cured resin because as
a breeder into the cultivation to see what
[SPEAKER_07]: the strain really is in its patient true
essence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that's how we like the cured
resin to see, let the plant speak and just
[SPEAKER_07]: finish out the full way to maturity it
needs to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, Colin and Archive Fletcher in the
house.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_13]: How's everybody doing tonight?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a bit since I've seen Fletcher,
like for real.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kind of like barely recognizing you
right now, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Colin, thanks for asking and welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when I first got bubble bags
from you, Marcus, that was, gosh,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe your first set ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have the set.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that long, the 25 bag that was that
really long one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it pink?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of pink, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could probably go and dig it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a 2001.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason that bag was pink is it
signified the birth of my daughter.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's now 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 18 years ago, that was my first set
from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I did was wash dried material.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at the time, that's all we really,
we never even thought to freeze material.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't in our thought process at
that point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to the point the other guy was making
about the dried heads are really important
[SPEAKER_05]: to give you a true essence of what that
particular progeny can actually do for you
[SPEAKER_05]: long term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because drying, there's several ways to do
all of this to get to that end goal,
[SPEAKER_05]: to get that maximum terpene profile that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's really no wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just personal preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I find today, I like the mix of both
personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there's a lot to learn from
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a tremendous to take away
from your dried material.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think right now what I'm doing now
is all fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm starting to do drying times and
trying to back myself back into dry
[SPEAKER_05]: material itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a long process.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's been really interesting seeing
the yields and the results.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm definitely pro both of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just definitely say if you really want
to see what your resin is made of,
[SPEAKER_13]: dry that shit out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Run it through some dry sift screens or
some water hash bags.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just of course you can do it fresh
through bags and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's nice to have that idea of what it
can do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's also something to be said that
the way the resin breaks off when it's
[SPEAKER_13]: been properly cured and when the head has
been allowed like Stunk Man talked about
[SPEAKER_13]: on Hash Church last Sunday, sort of to
raisin out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to not be that big fresh water
balloon, but to start raisining out a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit and kind of getting pruned up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that just makes it so the head becomes
so much easier to snap off.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's something to be said for that
as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a lot really strain specific
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's certain things that wash well
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's stuff that does well dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my personal opinion at least is
that a lot of it has to do with the
[SPEAKER_09]: concentration of terpenes versus THC
inside the head.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just like alcohol can prevent water
from freezing, if the terpene content
[SPEAKER_09]: inside the head is too high, it's not
gonna freeze.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll see this when you like make a
lot of BHO and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Certain varieties, the slabs literally
will not freeze just because the terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: content is so high.
[SPEAKER_09]: And considering we can only get water to
32 degrees really, or maybe 31 or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna have a hard time getting
varieties that have thin, cuticles and
[SPEAKER_09]: high terpene content to not just break
apart and basically become part of the
[SPEAKER_09]: water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or in certain cases I've even seen the
heads are still really sticky at freezing
[SPEAKER_09]: temp or 32 degrees or whatever your cold
water's at.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll stick together and it'll be
stuck in your 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the whole bottom of the 220 bag will
be gold.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just full of gold, but there's no
real way to extract it because you can't
[SPEAKER_09]: get the heads to break apart again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And certain strains when you dry them,
they like shrink together and then the
[SPEAKER_09]: heads become these little balls.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you're washing dry, those balls
will break off, but they're well over 220
[SPEAKER_09]: microns.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're just never able to catch them.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the problems of our trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been washing for the past month,
maybe 30 pounds a day, something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing all kinds of different
varieties washing and a lot of the CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties, we're seeing a major yield in
the 25 and 45 and really nothing in the 90
[SPEAKER_05]: and 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to your point, that's so true.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, every strain is different,
whether it's better, there's certain
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties like I used to have a white
rhino cross with skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It made the best dry sift and full melt
from dry trim.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, bubble man, that was that photo
that Shroomy sent to you back in the day
[SPEAKER_09]: that was the screen like this with the two
bubbles on both sides of the screen,
[SPEAKER_09]: probably like 2004 or five on the Fresh
Heddy's website.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember it, I remember it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was dry sifted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was dry sifted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just from sifting in a key box basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just really, the heads broke
off really easily and they didn't have a
[SPEAKER_09]: really high terpene content, so they're
really easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time I was using all the power
in my apartment or condo for growing,
[SPEAKER_09]: so I didn't run any heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: So 45 degrees, 50 degrees inside your
house, pretty decent fucking working
[SPEAKER_09]: environment.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you don't have to talk to me,
I live in Canada, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we got like eight months of that shit
like all day long.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not far from you, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've moved to a reasonable part of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just visiting Manitoba and it was
minus 37 when I was there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, maybe there's a way to make
hash in negative 37.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, one thing that I've thought would
be interesting, although I don't know if
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a reasonable way to do it,
but so let's say you have these lower
[SPEAKER_09]: temperature varieties that like,
let's say they would wash if you could get
[SPEAKER_09]: your washing liquid to zero degrees or
negative 15, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you had like salt to your water or a
glycol bath instead of water, there's like
[SPEAKER_09]: a million different things you could do to
prevent the water from freezing,
[SPEAKER_09]: but would you be able to wash that out
afterwards?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's actually applicable,
but what other liquid could you use that's
[SPEAKER_09]: not water that freezes at a lower
temperature, has a lower freezing point,
[SPEAKER_09]: so that you could have varieties that
don't wash at 32 degrees, maybe wash in
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotta admit, there haven't been too many
plants I couldn't wash.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not so many that I'd start designing
methodologies to, I mean, maybe when Napro
[SPEAKER_13]: releases like a 10% terpene strain or
something, I guess it'll become more of an
[SPEAKER_13]: issue, but I gotta admit, like at this
point in time, even after last Sunday when
[SPEAKER_13]: we all just named a few cultivars that
washed really well, I began to realize
[SPEAKER_13]: there is a lot of cannabis that you can
grow that will produce beautiful resin and
[SPEAKER_13]: give you nice yields, beautiful terpene
profiles, and it's being done on a daily
[SPEAKER_13]: basis by just even the people on this
panel right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: So many names I didn't even recognize,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you probably would, as you have your
finger more on that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just know a lot of varieties that are
really excellent flowers to smoke,
[SPEAKER_09]: but don't really make very good hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dry trim or fresh frozen, but are really
wonderful flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can breed those varieties and
eventually find one that has the flavor
[SPEAKER_09]: and washes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But just, I was just from a, it'd be a
good science experiment is all I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you had something that didn't wash at
32 degrees, you were able to get your
[SPEAKER_09]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now let's say it's salt water to 15
degrees, and now it does wash because
[SPEAKER_09]: you've reached that point of where the
head is actually freezing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be interesting just to see if that is
what is causing the disparity between
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should wash haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody needs to grow some haze and then
wash some haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need some haze hash in my life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I love haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: Haze is my son's middle name.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a bar of Schramm do-si-do right
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it's pure lemon haze funk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That Schramm dumps though.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Schramm dumps though, historically
it's been a great hash producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a, I'm sure that that outcross
you made, especially the do-si-do is
[SPEAKER_05]: probably insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: It retained all the terpenes, but you
know, bigger bags.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a faster finish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just actually, I just actually exhaled
some Seedman haze and that shit was
[SPEAKER_13]: lemony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Real good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stuff that Fletch shared with me
recently was really lemon haze heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you know, it's good when you ask
someone how, what did that taste like?
[SPEAKER_13]: And they say another one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some of these lemon peel I'm
cheaping on now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm going to pause out if someone
wants to take over the conversation for a
[SPEAKER_11]: few minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to add to the, to the resident
texture conversation part was what we do
[SPEAKER_08]: here with some of the ones that don't bosh
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really cultivate too many like
that because you know what my aim is,
[SPEAKER_08]: but when we find ones like CBD ones or
some lemony profiles, like some hiding
[SPEAKER_08]: lemony ones that don't wash too well,
we notice that they are really oily right
[SPEAKER_08]: off the touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to make tinctures or sabs or just
like oils, you know, with those they seem
[SPEAKER_08]: to be like water soluble.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I wash them, you know, a lot of the
turps are just floating on top.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where if I, if we make it into,
you know, some other type of product,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's I think a lot better and none of a
waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like to see that kind of happen too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like we come up with a strain list
for hashes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like let's come up with a cultivar,
sorry, list for, you know, tinctures and
[SPEAKER_08]: topicals and such, you know, that'd be
really cool too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, did I go mute?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was muted answering you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, but cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like something that I always look
at here as like, as the grower,
[SPEAKER_08]: when it comes down to harvest time and
we're growing so many new phenos.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, you know, we have a tendency,
we run a clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got our phenos that we like to,
you know, we know what they're all about
[SPEAKER_08]: and how they grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then there's the new ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's like more than half the
garden all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to just hunt through the new stuff is
so fun, but it's a real trial and error.
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting better with that is now
figuring out the parents and the,
[SPEAKER_08]: of the cultivars to know, you know,
you're, we're bringing hash plants and
[SPEAKER_08]: we're breeding into more hash plants and
it makes it a lot easier for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to know what hash plants are what I
always let homies know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure, you know, with the cultivar
list that you guys were talking about the
[SPEAKER_08]: other day, like those type of strains,
like if anybody looked up with those
[SPEAKER_08]: strains were, and then looked at the
parents of those strains could really find
[SPEAKER_08]: out what I'm talking about pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's really cool to,
yeah, to kind of know the difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, we're already avoiding to
like waste time or waste materials.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, I kind of search at harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, I go out there in the field and I
work everything by hand, like kind of like
[SPEAKER_08]: charros rub it at first.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to talk about that too,
is some hand rub hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that shit's really fucking next
level.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to talk about that,
which I'll put on next, but like,
[SPEAKER_08]: when you know, you're searching for the
hash plants, I really like to find the
[SPEAKER_08]: ones that are, you could feel the heads
like on your fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, that's the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: I shared that same sentiment where I look
at the parent stock that was used before
[SPEAKER_05]: even considering any seeds at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's super important to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're talking like over a year of
work easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're, even if you're just
doing it indoor, if you're doing outdoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: like probably two, like year and a half,
maybe two years of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to potentially find something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, that's, that's an unspoken
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that doesn't get talked about
people that find those Finos.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's so much work to,
to find something that is actually watches
[SPEAKER_04]: and checks all the boxes and that you want
to keep running.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have four in my stable that I've
kept all this time out of all,
[SPEAKER_05]: all the time that I've been washing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those four are with me still to this
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard out there, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's getting, it's getting even more
difficult because, you know, everyone kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of claims that sharing is caring and is
like, Oh yeah, you know, I like to share
[SPEAKER_13]: the genetics and get them out to people
right up until you ask them for a cut.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I give a lot of cuts away over the
course of the last five years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel like I can say this,
you know, I had cuts given to me by all
[SPEAKER_13]: sorts of wonderful breeders and never once
did I feel like it was my duty to
[SPEAKER_13]: interview the people I was giving them to,
to make sure that they were going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: good enough to receive this particular
cut.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was a ton of people in my city
who felt this way and actually got quite
[SPEAKER_13]: upset with me for just giving them away.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was always like, I'd be like,
well, what, what if, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, this guy that supposedly doesn't
deserve the clone, what if he gets it?
[SPEAKER_13]: But then one of the first people he gets
it to is like a sick little girl with
[SPEAKER_13]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_13]: The profile just is so, you know,
and I'm trying to get them to see like,
[SPEAKER_13]: listen, like the world is not quite as
limiting as you think it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are these connections that can occur
in, in, in, in ways that you can't
[SPEAKER_13]: possibly fathom.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the only way to kind of support that
is to do good and doing good is sharing
[SPEAKER_13]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give them out because I can't handle
listening to people who lost their
[SPEAKER_13]: genetics while hoarding them.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, Oh, here, let me pull the
tiniest little violin out and play you a
[SPEAKER_13]: song.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so sorry that you were an asshole and
didn't give your cuts away to anyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now you've lost them and you have no
one to call and say, Hey, can I get my
[SPEAKER_13]: cuts back?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's important in a 77 words.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to save a strain, give it
away.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the crazy man himself, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, but don't give it away like this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can have this cut, but here's a long
list of like your Ozzy Osborne and you
[SPEAKER_13]: have a rider.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're going to play the venue or
something, it's like, I'm going to need
[SPEAKER_13]: the red M&Ms.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to need, uh, it's like,
come on, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you give someone a cut, just don't have
anything tied to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: iPad looks nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kush Kirk.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're about to crush that out or what?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just right in my, both of my ears,
like in stereo.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's no one in this room that,
that understands that more than Colin
[SPEAKER_13]: because he's literally a professional
musician and does like studio music work
[SPEAKER_13]: and like has headphones on all the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know he appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though I went for the mute and I just
missed it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all good, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to be here talking about hash
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked, uh, look at this iPad,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you, what are you dabbing up
there, brother?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he's muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me unmute him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a puppy breath.
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy breath is, um, Mendo breath black
dog by Bio Vortex bred this one last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I grew like a few Finos here,
I think like five or six different Finos
[SPEAKER_08]: of the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Melts amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it that you're holding up?
[SPEAKER_13]: The Micron.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Micron.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, um, it's the 120 and the 70 combined
from, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's underneath the 150 bag to the 70
bag.
[SPEAKER_13]: The 70, the 90 and the 120.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mixed most of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't, I just kind of separate
the one, uh, the 40 and I separate like
[SPEAKER_08]: the 150.
[SPEAKER_08]: The outdoor, I got the particulates flying
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like the particulates are just more
abundant than like, but it's, this is
[SPEAKER_08]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been rained on for every month.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was at negative like, or not
negative.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was at 20 degrees for a few nights
before I harvested it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This just, this plant went through some
shit here in the valley.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: It got washed every night.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the, yo, I will say shout out to
Bio Vortex.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, hands down as one of the dankest like
breeders for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, all the shit that I ran from him was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did the banana dog as well, which is the
banana OG with the SFB black dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just unreal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hard to get on, hard to get his stuff
for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but if you can, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good to have those tips.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really what hash makers want to
know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they want to know every possible
secret they can possibly know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I find a lot of the time it's not too hard
to find varieties that wash well or yield
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and vice versa, you'll find ones that
smoke well, but as flowers, but it's
[SPEAKER_09]: really hard to find ones that are really
good flowers and really good washers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that's been my experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty, it's pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, just in general.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just haven't smoked flowers in 19
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, I, you know, OGKB is one
that seems to wash really well as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the, at times, most things is going
to do well in washing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a terrible plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a terrible, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to find something that does it
all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had that for five years now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still, I rock it every year just for
head staff mostly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the select few homies that come
through and wants their shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's straight medicine though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like when, yeah, yeah, it's hardcore
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does a lot better outside than it does
inside too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does way better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they like the hugel or some like real
like thick soil, um, this doesn't need
[SPEAKER_08]: much water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what we got kind of going on in the
backyard here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's pretty gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are you guys washing right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what's some of your favorite
cultivars that you guys are running that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that seemed to get good yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and what, what yields are you guys
getting out of those?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be a good, good topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be a good topic to kind
of go over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a lot of the time like multiple
phenos.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Chris would know better.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, we're running a lot of Moonbow,
a lot of lemon cane, a lot of lemon peel,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Moonbow and lemon cane and the lemon
peel are absolutely my favorite ones to
[SPEAKER_05]: wash right now at the shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Moonbow between the night one,
like the 99 and the 112, those two phenos
[SPEAKER_05]: give like four and a half to 5% back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and three and a half of that sits
between the 149 and the 90U and the rest
[SPEAKER_05]: is just, you know, 70, 40 and you're,
you're like 180 and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's all your, you're collecting a
bunch of it as full mill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything presses back between like 85
and 92%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're fantastic to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we do washes all hand stirred between
10 to 15,000 grams at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so we're pulling massive patties
off those.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, especially the lemon peel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you're looking for a strain that's
like very heavy on the limit herbs,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, it washes extremely well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's not the easiest to get,
but I was going to say no one can get
[SPEAKER_05]: their hands on that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to the shop and you can come get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, you, you gotta really
know somebody, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, but it dumps it's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and the lemon cane is the one that we
took down to like that ego clash and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, took first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hash with, um, that one produces
really crazy full mouth for a strain with
[SPEAKER_05]: that terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool doubt.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you took first at the ego clash,
how, how, uh, that was quite an event.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've, that was my first time in
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't really know what to expect,
but it was like, it was out in Midocino.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it was just like piss and rain,
tons of mud everywhere, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it was a phenomenal event,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was tons of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was so much good melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I didn't get to see a lot of the
cousin that was there, but I definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: fucked with a lot of the full melt that
was brought to the table and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's maybe one or two jars that I
was not really stoked on, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was all, it was all really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it was all, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of papaya heavy crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so it was interesting to see that
everyone, you know, is kind of leaning
[SPEAKER_05]: towards those fruity terpenes right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dutch varieties always made the best hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that was like a product of
Sam's, uh, selective breeding with scump
[SPEAKER_09]: number one, most likely.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But man, a lot of those varieties really,
like I said, one of the best washing
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties I ever had from dry trim was
white rhino cross scump number one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, it just, it did phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some skunk going at the farm right
now that's probably going to be dedicated
[SPEAKER_05]: towards hash, like some fresh rosin here
soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll report back on numbers for that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shortly, but, uh, it was like granddaddy
skunk or granny skunk we got going right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be interesting to see what that
does.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been raving this year about,
um, this weasel skunk from nature farm
[SPEAKER_10]: that we grew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we grew, we grew eight plants and
every single one of them made awesome
[SPEAKER_10]: hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, just greasy and unreal yields like
near 20% probably.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I'm really impressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really gassy, like, uh, race fuel terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just did a London bridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: London bridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anyone smoked London bridge?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen those seeds around in the cut
being passed around, but I haven't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a, is that London pound cake cross
or what's the lineage on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Pound cake and Sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was from Jigga apparently, and I got it
from a friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it just like, I haven't smoked it yet
and I'm pretty interested.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like on a next level cookie
gas, gassy cookie, uh, kind of giving us a
[SPEAKER_08]: GMO notes in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fan favorite over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got like crazy long list in my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, what else I got?
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, golden strawberries.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one is just like a 20% on dry five
and a half.
[SPEAKER_08]: What, um, that one's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's straight strawberry shortcake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and what else would he, uh,
guava punch.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my new one that I made,
uh, from breeding the strawberry guava
[SPEAKER_08]: from Oni with a purple punch dosido.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't know who the seed pack though
came from.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got, I took the, it was pretty much a
pollen chuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took the mail from a buddy's bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it took the mail cause he was going to
throw it out and I was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I saw potential in it and I brought it
home, stressed it out and ended up seeing
[SPEAKER_08]: the resident on the mail.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I knew it was a keeper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, then I just brought it into the whole
32 plant, um, straw guava room and knocked
[SPEAKER_08]: up the whole room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ended up washing the whole room and
collecting seed at the same time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's, it's been a really good
fucking one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anyone else done that too?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been pretty freaking cool that I
grew a whole room of seed, four lights,
[SPEAKER_08]: 32 plants, and.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got like that, I mean that 10,000,
maybe more seeds and a whole room of
[SPEAKER_08]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've never done anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, neither have I, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran your guava punch though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took all the, I took all the fucking
wash material and I put it out in the hoop
[SPEAKER_08]: house and I put plastic over the hoop
house and they all sprouted up out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: nugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I let that thing grow into the sticky
shape.
[SPEAKER_08]: What it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, if anyone saw the sticky shake
that I did, that shit was, that was all
[SPEAKER_08]: just straw guava mixed phenos.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was like 35 different phenos in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had like a party inside the bush.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I would definitely hope that no
one ever did do a seed batch and not make
[SPEAKER_13]: hash with the material.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause if they didn't, that would just
crush my, my soul to know that people are
[SPEAKER_13]: just pulling these mad seed harvest off
and be like, what should we do with all
[SPEAKER_13]: this bud?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just fucking get rid of it,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we can't have that shit lying around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I bet most people are, I mean,
not offensively it's hard cause you don't
[SPEAKER_08]: want to get the seeds wet or something and
you want to sell the seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, yeah, it was like a,
it's definitely my intention was to wash
[SPEAKER_08]: the whole room first.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just saw the opportunity arise
with the mail and then it kind of got a
[SPEAKER_08]: little out of control.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I only brought it in there for a damn
day and I was like, Oh, well who the hell
[SPEAKER_08]: knows, you know, how much probably can
come off then the whole room was dusted
[SPEAKER_08]: full, full blunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was, it was bad ass though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, job provided.
[SPEAKER_13]: Job does provide.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hope to you ever make it down to the
Island down to Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a bunch of homies though that are
ready to pick me up off the airport and
[SPEAKER_08]: bring me to the Rasta village.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Montego Bay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I haven't even,
I haven't talked to him in a good month
[SPEAKER_08]: and a half or shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been like year and a half now.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a great country to make hash and I'll
tell you some of the best hash I ever made
[SPEAKER_13]: in my life was outdoor grown cannabis from
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that'd be, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to go do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to get away from the farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just like full blown busy here all
the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: The life of the farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like you go on mad vacations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you know more than some of the
folks, but we have like a full blown,
[SPEAKER_08]: like we have a bunch of animals and shit
to take care of.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why and five acres that we like
fully will utilize like every bit of it
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always, I always tell everyone like that
are homies to come on out and come kick it
[SPEAKER_08]: for a damn day and like, so just relax.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like paradise out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely paradise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so beautiful out there, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the greatest place I've ever been to
for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes me kind of hurt a little bit
because I can't come to the US,
[SPEAKER_13]: but maybe one day they'll figure it out
and they'll just allow cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_13]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'll just be like, me and all
these other people will be like,
[SPEAKER_13]: we're coming down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you hide in the back of Josh and
Kelly's truck when they're like all that
[SPEAKER_08]: shit in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could get down here, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go across with Josh and Kelly and Sky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hiding a bag for the border.
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you doing in here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll just be like ripping it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, the last time I tried to get over
the border, I was, I was driving my
[SPEAKER_13]: Volkswagen van, potentiating my
stereotype, you know, and I got to the
[SPEAKER_13]: border and the customs guy was like,
where are you going?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, I'm just going down to
California to see the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_13]: man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I shit you not, this guy from the
middle of nowhere, middle of Canada,
[SPEAKER_13]: looked at me and said, the Grateful Dead,
Jerry Garcia, pull over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was like, that was the,
I never got across the border.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I actually ended up giving all of
those concert tickets away to hippies that
[SPEAKER_13]: I met in the forest in British Columbia,
because I was so bummed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had these mail order tickets.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were like the shiny and sparkly ones
for like, you know, like, geez,
[SPEAKER_13]: what shows would they be?
[SPEAKER_13]: For they were for like, what's the big
Cali one, the big, what the fuck was the
[SPEAKER_13]: California venue?
[SPEAKER_13]: The Fillmore?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was an outdoor venue.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all summer.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was like, they played a Portland
show.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had, I had tickets to see Jerry with
Merle in like Seattle.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like this, you know, nice four or
five run thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And anyway, that was the start of my not
going to the US.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I haven't been down there since,
since fish 98 at the gorge.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my last trip to So sorry to get
off topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're back on hash here.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people do smoke hash at Grateful
Dead and fish concerts.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could talk about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, so we, you guys were touching on
drying before and you know, I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, one thing I wanted to talk about was
drying times and, and pumps
[SPEAKER_12]: in value.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and there's a company out there called
Le Boyd and I just want everyone to be
[SPEAKER_05]: aware of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to share this.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't already know this and I,
you're just going to have just,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's L E Y B O D Le Boyd.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they're very expensive pumps,
but they will allow you to get at a,
[SPEAKER_05]: at a really, uh, a much more consistent
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so you're not actually pulling all the
desirables out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, you know, I could give,
I've been a being this for a really long
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I just think it's, it's valuable
information for everybody to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think it's important to just share
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they're a great company.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just reach out to them,
but, but it'll allow everything to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can do what I would do in
let's say 40 or 72 hours in, in much less
[SPEAKER_05]: time with much higher quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's, it's just a lovely,
you know, addition to a not so great,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, setup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's like bringing a machine gun
basically to a night flight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's, it's, it's that,
it's that much, uh, it's reducing the
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of time that you're in the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it gets to a much deeper vacuum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so it's what temperatures are you
running on that then?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, 30 say that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the military?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the vacuum pressure that you
actually do get down to?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the vacuum pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pressures that we're getting down to
for the laboid, um, I don't have my notes
[SPEAKER_05]: in front of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can pull it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let me see if I can pull this up for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to talk about ice and what you
guys like for ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love, uh, craft cold.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if you guys have heard of
those machines make really wicked ice,
[SPEAKER_13]: just really nice solid RO machines hook up
to them and they make really nice cubed
[SPEAKER_13]: ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've always found that there's certain ice
that just wasn't what I wanted to use.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could avoid it, like the chip ice,
um, you know, that you get in hotels and
[SPEAKER_13]: cheap store bought ice, any ice with
fluoride.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always tried to avoid that sort of stuff
and even had quite good luck surprisingly
[SPEAKER_13]: back in the day in Switzerland when we
made a lot of our ice by freezing just
[SPEAKER_13]: like all sorts of different things that
we'd then hammer and smash.
[SPEAKER_13]: The ice was quite sharp and big chunks and
smaller chunks, but it really seemed to do
[SPEAKER_13]: the job on breaking the resin off.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, uh, it's something that
people don't always look at.
[SPEAKER_13]: They get used to their process.
[SPEAKER_13]: They always use the same ice and I'll,
I'll suggest to them, have you ever just
[SPEAKER_13]: switched your ice up a little bit?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like maybe like, like how cold the ice is,
how clear the ice is, is it foggy?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like what's the pH of the water?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there's, there's quite a bit that
goes into simply making ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and I just wondered some of your
thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can come back when you find it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just figured while you were looking,
I'd keep the conversation going on ice and
[SPEAKER_05]: we can keep it going.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but yeah, I just don't have the
numbers in front of me guys, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, uh, it's, it's like, it's double to
triple what a normal pump can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's going to, uh, it's here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to share this with you guys
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll get back to ice because
that shit's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the farm, we make our own ice with
the same water we wash with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been really helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like makes 400 pounds of ice for
us a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the guy had helping me stir buckets,
bags, ice a ton of the time too,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it helps, you know, being able to
make your own ice with the same water that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're washing with.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you use water chillers?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you use water chillers to preserve that
ice?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you don't have to use so much?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the room that we wash in is extremely
cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't really have to use too much
ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it stays about 42 to 45 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you store your water in that room?
[SPEAKER_05]: The water is stored in that room and the
tap where the water comes out of is also
[SPEAKER_05]: in that room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that I use is, is based out of
that room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also here in Oregon, I mean,
our water room, right now probably comes
[SPEAKER_04]: out like what 40, like upper forties,
mid forties right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cold anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very cold water for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it's great being able to wash with
32 and rinse with, you know, 32 degree
[SPEAKER_05]: water that helps tremendously.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing how much ice you go through.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not taking the temperature of
the water and your water is a little more
[SPEAKER_13]: than it needs to be and you're doing big
batches, it will just, it will just melt
[SPEAKER_13]: your ice like nobody's business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You eat up a ton of ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're doing like 10 to 15 K batches
at a time of fresh rose and yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you eat up a ton of ice if you're not in a
cold environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as it makes a lot more particulate
if you have to have more ice in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need that room for water to lubricate
and kind of give that softening aspect to
[SPEAKER_04]: the wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the biggest thing I noticed is
washing in that cold room is I use a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: less ice and it's, you know, it's a lot
easier to stir those bigger buckets now
[SPEAKER_05]: because there's not, you know,
60 pounds of ice in there hurling around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only using like 10 to 20 pounds at
a time now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe like 60 pounds for a whole wash like
in a whole batch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but per bucket, you know, you're maybe
used to 20 at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's a 44 gallon bucket with,
like I said, 10 to 15 K at a time depends
[SPEAKER_05]: on the material.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, as you get into larger systems,
it becomes quite important to have things
[SPEAKER_13]: like water chillers because the otherwise
the ice production just really reduces
[SPEAKER_13]: your economic viability of the whole
project, you know, working out and not
[SPEAKER_13]: turning into this overpriced product that
someone's just going to have to pay for so
[SPEAKER_13]: much ridiculousness along the way.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to be able to scale these things
while not affecting the purity.
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't say quality because what we work
with as hash makers is really more purity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Quality is what the genetics and the
growers have given to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are the ones who unveil it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we unveil is really dependent upon
what, you know, the work that they did,
[SPEAKER_13]: the months and months of variables that
they fought versus the, uh, Oh,
[SPEAKER_13]: it could be a day.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be a week of variables that we,
that we face as hash makers, unless it's a
[SPEAKER_13]: real big batch and it maybe takes you
longer than that, but can't compare it to
[SPEAKER_13]: the growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and the variables that they have to
have to kind of deal with and navigate
[SPEAKER_13]: over the course of, you know, the three
plus months of some of these cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_13]: Flowering out and then being even some of
the, you know, like not running fresh
[SPEAKER_13]: frozen, curing that out for another little
while and getting that into, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: ready to process and then making hash and
curing that out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, man, the first time I smoked Sam's
hash, I'm quite certain that material is
[SPEAKER_13]: probably cured for three or four months.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the hash itself was probably
three or four months by the time I smoked
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was, you know, shocking to me in
1995.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shocking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But being the grower too, it also helps
eliminate any errors that might come up
[SPEAKER_04]: because you can think about it like,
okay, I did this, this time, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: changed up this, you know, had a little
lower temperatures flush for a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: longer or whatever, you know, this season
was a bit warmer, a bit colder at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a little more intimate
relationship with that resin head and can
[SPEAKER_04]: understand what it's potentially going to
be doing for you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing more.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing more.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing more beautiful than
walking through the garden and seeing
[SPEAKER_10]: those heads just stick out from a mile
away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you just know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you, if you really want a bonus
tip from me to all of you, a really
[SPEAKER_13]: important factor on hash making and
cannabis growing is being able to see
[SPEAKER_13]: what's going on microscopically.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you can get yourself a really good,
I mean, something that allows you to go in
[SPEAKER_13]: and spend time in that macro world of
trichomes and just really exactly,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, getting right into, I've been
doing this since 2008 and I can't tell you
[SPEAKER_13]: enough that it's really a worthwhile,
it's what taught me about trichomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, while we've been on this show,
Mark Scaldone sent me an article called,
[SPEAKER_13]: he said, did you see this?
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's called chemical factories.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the subtitle here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chemical factories, cannabis trichomes
under the microscope a recent study has
[SPEAKER_13]: revealed the internal structures of
cannabis biochemical factories,
[SPEAKER_13]: trichomes and note that these hairs can be
used as a measure of potency.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you're kidding.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_13]: The guys at university figured it out
finally that these cannabis trichome hairs
[SPEAKER_13]: are what determine the potency on the,
on the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they go on to, I guess,
claim that for the first time ever,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're explaining what's going on inside
these little, I haven't read the whole
[SPEAKER_13]: thing and maybe they have figured out some
new things.
[SPEAKER_13]: This information has been out there for
quite a long time and in a, in a multitude
[SPEAKER_13]: of publications, even myself and Jeremiah
from cannabis culture wrote an article in
[SPEAKER_13]: 2000 and it might've been three,
it might've been five or six called inside
[SPEAKER_13]: the trichome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it very much explains what's going on
inside the trichome and the different
[SPEAKER_13]: types of organelles and the vacuoles and
the plastids and the phenols and the
[SPEAKER_13]: hydrocarbons and how they push up into the
upper membrane and cook with UVB light and
[SPEAKER_13]: produce CBGA.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then from there, the entire
cannabinoid and terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that information has probably been out
there maybe since the sixties or seventies
[SPEAKER_13]: even.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not too sure, but definitely something
worth checking out if you guys want,
[SPEAKER_13]: I will post it both in our private chat
here with the panelists.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can figure out how to send you guys
all, here we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll send that to you guys and then I'll
send it to everyone in the YouTube chat as
[SPEAKER_13]: well.
[SPEAKER_13]: So haven't actually looked over here in a
second, but I guess we got 440 people
[SPEAKER_13]: watching with us right now, which is just
over 420.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me send this to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: To compound on your point a little bit
too, I've noticed with lighting indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: with lighting grows that have higher UVA
and UVB lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually do have usually higher,
both higher THC percentages and more melty
[SPEAKER_04]: strains and larger resin heads usually.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this mystery is going to be unsolved
or solved, I should say in the next
[SPEAKER_13]: decade, maybe less where you get a lot
more people being able to do this and
[SPEAKER_13]: engage and start kind of compiling this
data.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's going to be all sorts of
different softwares that are developed
[SPEAKER_13]: that allow that data to be sort of
amalgamated or made out, created into more
[SPEAKER_13]: of a digital landscape that makes it for
easier navigation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm pretty excited for the data to come
out on all these different, the
[SPEAKER_13]: differences in the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_13]: And why is this one waxy and this one's
this certain way?
[SPEAKER_13]: And why is it that this one's not washing
well?
[SPEAKER_13]: These would be interesting mysteries to me
to just have a full understanding.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm quite certain that science will
answer the majority of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to go off what Bubble Man was
saying, like a cheap, like $120,
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 to 80x stereo microscope is like one of
the best tools you can get.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only for hash making, but just for
growing, for identifying pests and all
[SPEAKER_09]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're real cheap, like a stereo
microscope.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need the compound microscope or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it lets you start navigating that
different world where you're just,
[SPEAKER_13]: you're so, when I started shooting macro
cannabis, I first of all couldn't believe
[SPEAKER_13]: how beautiful it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really blew me away at how just
beautiful it was inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was blown away at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then I started like, well,
what is, you know, why is that different
[SPEAKER_13]: from that?
[SPEAKER_13]: And what is that called?
[SPEAKER_13]: And so then I started, you know,
like Chimera was really helpful and Skunk
[SPEAKER_13]: Man Sam and Rob Clark, guys that had some
history with this, you know, that had
[SPEAKER_13]: worked in labs and that had been doing
this since the eighties and understood
[SPEAKER_13]: some of the important terminologies that
if you were going to be able to even
[SPEAKER_13]: search the internet and you didn't know
the terminology of a particular trichome,
[SPEAKER_13]: like a systolic hair even for that matter,
it was very hard to describe it into
[SPEAKER_13]: Google and get any accuracy or find
anything on it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the macro photography for me,
let me get to a point where I was like,
[SPEAKER_13]: okay, I need to understand what all these
things are.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, starting to do that
research was really helpful.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess today, nowadays we have it so
good.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just go on Instagram and check out the
hashtag and all of a sudden it's like,
[SPEAKER_13]: oh, you got all the information you need
about trichomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of a crazy thing in a good way
to be able to share information in such an
[SPEAKER_13]: easy way and connect with so many people
that it's, I mean, it's how a lot of us
[SPEAKER_13]: have connected here right now through
social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dutchess, so it's between 600 and we're
maxing out at 900 mTOR.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the deepest vacuum that we've
attempted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the scientific can go like
significantly lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm getting much lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like way lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to bring that number as low as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an updated system,
by all means get lower than that because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can definitely, I've had it sitting at
170 mTOR.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sits at about 125 to 215 for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use the pharmaceutical units and I can
try two to 300 gram trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the top end, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, and then the numbers that we
have for when we go into vacuum are
[SPEAKER_05]: ranging from 25 to 50.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's getting down to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what we're getting down to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just giving you guys a range of
like where it can go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then actually, and my cousin,
he just texted me, he's like, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude, it can get down to 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a chart that you can Google
and check.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll give you a reference point of,
you know, when you pull down to that kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of, you know, military and temperatures,
the terpenes still boil off when you're in
[SPEAKER_05]: those ranges.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's kind of a very fine
line of how low do you really want to go
[SPEAKER_05]: and how long you want to sit at that point
because, you know, terpenes will boil off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously check your freeze dryer water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everyone knows that there will
be terpenes left over in that,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I've been toying around with that
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like how low do you want to go
and how long do you want to have it sit
[SPEAKER_05]: there because are you really starting to
degrade the purity of the product at that
[SPEAKER_05]: point or are you just pulling out more
terpenes at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what about the temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, like, I have to tell you,
I've been very surprised that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never over 35 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I sit my face to 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're as low as you can go.
[SPEAKER_11]: How low can you go?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about as low as you can go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for a harvest rate to release
a unit where you can set each shelf to its
[SPEAKER_05]: own temperature because that would be
ideal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they'll ever do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking to Le Boyd, I don't even know if
I'm even pronouncing that and probably be
[SPEAKER_05]: botching that name.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you should talk to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really great guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've helped me out a lot and I
definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for sharing that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we need is a software engineer,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, dude, we're getting there,
you know, and we're going to get there
[SPEAKER_05]: really quickly if we can all just kind of
share this information, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think you could realistically have
different shelf temps in the same vacuum
[SPEAKER_09]: space, though, because it's all like,
the variations aren't going to be,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're not going to be able to like make
sure that this shelf and this shelf,
[SPEAKER_09]: when it's in the same vacuum, are actually
10 degrees different from each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'd be really hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, unless you're getting a half million
dollar lyophilization oven, like a true
[SPEAKER_13]: pharmaceutical unit, 200 kilos at a time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really just what the setting of the
shelf would be then at that point.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_13]: They become independent.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're independent.
[SPEAKER_09]: The sensors, having sensors that could
detect that and maintain that in one
[SPEAKER_09]: vacuum would be really difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the most effective thing I've
found... I imagine so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rackens, I have never seen that,
bud, but, you know, you might be able to,
[SPEAKER_05]: like Marcus said, there's scientific ones
out there that can probably do more.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not privy to any of that stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: When batches get that big for me,
I have two freeze dryers, luckily,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're both seven shelves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I need to set one freeze dryer to a
totally different temperature than the
[SPEAKER_05]: other one, there's the option to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really ran into that all that
much, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, check out Milrock Technology,
lyophilizers from laboratory to
[SPEAKER_13]: production.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an interesting company that does a
whole variety of like a ton of different
[SPEAKER_13]: laboratory style freeze dryers,
research development freeze dryers,
[SPEAKER_13]: pilot freeze dryers, you know,
small production freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to check them out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's big boy toys in the sense like,
wow, like I don't know if they make like a
[SPEAKER_13]: four or $5,000 unit, but it's definitely
neat to know about and, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: see maybe one day that technology will get
shrunk down.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the harvest rights are cool,
but I think they're more like of a toy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of slow, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, and it's the other
thing is, you know, getting down to
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature sooner is really important for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because it cuts down on the time that
you have to, the whole thing has to switch
[SPEAKER_05]: over to do all the functions it needs to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, as you said, we need a
software engineer to get that stuff fixed
[SPEAKER_05]: out, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they do have really weird things
with like the screen that aren't even like
[SPEAKER_05]: buttons that are noticeable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to know to press in that
area and you can set, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: from like, it does crazy weird stuff for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to be a lot more automated and
made for what we're doing, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to hear, I want to hear a little
bit from some people that haven't been
[SPEAKER_13]: able to talk because some of us have,
you know, loud voices and strong
[SPEAKER_13]: personalities.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of us are the quiet guys in the
background.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm talking to you Flav and Pua and
Best Friend Farms and even Great Lakes a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Heavy ice for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: You haven't been able to say much.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just, you know, we've got about a half
an hour more or so there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure each of you had little things you
might have wanted to talk about if you
[SPEAKER_13]: want.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a great time to steer the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Any one of you that feels like bringing
something up and saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: bringing something to the conversation
because I know you guys all do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought my weekly list of washes for our
cultivars here for the last week that we
[SPEAKER_07]: washed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to hear them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give it to us.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: We washed a couple phenotypes of 91 Royale
this last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Swamp Boys gear.
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of, we ran a couple things
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also the guava jelly, two different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, great results on both of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guava is super loud, fruit forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And 91 Royale, one of the phenotypes was,
seemed to be more on the tip of the,
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, Lenin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it Lenin?
[SPEAKER_07]: Lenin Royale.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever went into that, I think a GMO
lemon tree or lemon something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ran a pineapple field from dynasty
genetics also, and a couple of our own
[SPEAKER_07]: types.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that kosher kush back to Mac and
headband.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, a different phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one that we're calling gorilla food
that I bred.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the gorilla glue to Mac,
to a cake and cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I don't know if I mentioned a
couple GMO Tina phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my, I guess it was a 91 Royale.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the phenotypes just dumped it down
the most, really garbagey too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had that GMO rotten kind of thing on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Garbage truck dump.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always nice to hear about washes and
you know, what, what came out and what's
[SPEAKER_13]: going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd the pineapple fields do the dynasty
stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: This phenotype in particular, this was
actually the Cali Snapple pheno.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a Miss Universe pheno and a Cali
Snapple pheno.
[SPEAKER_07]: I decided that the Miss Universe is really
nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just kind of like that really sweet
feet kind of pineapple.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this, the number three, we call it,
but the Cali Snapple pheno.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely I used to grow a lot of Cali
Miss back in the day and it has the same
[SPEAKER_07]: look on it, but it has that kind of
overripe, but also a little sour underripe
[SPEAKER_07]: West coast, true pineapple turf.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're called star pineapple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've run Southern Humble and yeah,
it's actually, I think it's our first wash
[SPEAKER_07]: on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is from an indoor run organic,
you know, indoor living soil cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll have more results on it coming in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually, I drive for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I at, you know, at first that I go for
a 60 degree or a 50 degrees, 50% and then
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll shift my second week into 60 degrees,
60%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of do my hash drying,
air drying the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes me two weeks, like dial,
it does a two weeks breakdown.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really from like when we're getting
cured resin, even material, or from when
[SPEAKER_07]: we cut the plants down, it takes us a
month before we even see in our cured
[SPEAKER_07]: resin bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're, you know, I guess a couple of
weeks we'll know what the pineapple this
[SPEAKER_07]: pheno did more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, yeah, I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: We run so many flavors on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to just go back to the room to
see what the resin is looking like right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and what the date on it is for
exactly the day we ran up.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel, I feel really bad for you having
to do all that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so tough.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's rough for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: What about you Flav?
[SPEAKER_13]: You got anything to share today,
man?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're making hash squishing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you're on mute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me unmute you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do run a lot of hazes and they
return like one to 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're very worth it, even though
they flower for 14 weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my favorite hash to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what do you add?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you guys are talking all the right
numbers for the freeze dryers and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I do vary depending on the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find a lot of the sativas have a lot
drier resin even when you wash them in
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I vary the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have 15 for those and 20 for most
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I run, you know,
the machines relatively exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you have so much knowledge at
sitting at, you know, right here,
[SPEAKER_02]: what can you really add compared to the
people that are more rah-rah than the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of us?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, you could pop a big bowl of
hash out of like Buck Marcel Cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no, I have nothing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at work right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just came up from tendon
to the moms.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Taking care of business.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: What mom are you working with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I have Congo, Original Haze,
Trop Sando that I really like,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is GMO Trop Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite that I'm actually washing
right now a lot too, that returns really
[SPEAKER_02]: good, like 5% is the Afghani Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old Andy and Jeff Tech work from way
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Candy, candy, candy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to the San Diego Bull Rider
boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's fantastic and she dumps pretty good
and, you know, melty as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got a lot I could go through the
list, but it's like 70 or 80 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, just give us 10 more then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Old Northern Lights, some Super
Skunk, Strawberry Cough, some Coastal Rose
[SPEAKER_02]: that my buddy grew and this 101 Labs who's
just a local Sunshine Coast guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does this other one that he calls the
Miss Killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's King John Kush to an old hash plant
and it just has that soapy, charity,
[SPEAKER_02]: earthy fucking just amazingness to it that
you didn't have since I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 18, 19, like back in the,
you know, like just before 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's phenomenal stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I feel lucky because I can go hit
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm popping some archive right away
that I got in the soap that are coming up,
[SPEAKER_02]: some Tirefire.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that Super Skunk you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that Super Skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking phenomenal, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was always a really great variety
from, or I mean, I guess seed bank.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the old ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a lot of old, un-polluted
genetics, you know, so it's nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice to have un-polluted genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean polluted by, you know,
that sounded bad, but just un,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hybridized.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are hybrids, but, you know,
haven't been modern updates, let's call
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: It reminds me of my sort of rarest seed
that I have in my collection that I've
[SPEAKER_13]: been collecting seeds for almost 30 years
and probably my rarest that I have.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I got some good ones for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like friends that own seed banks just send
me their full collections.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like just here is, this is what my seed
collection has.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I get like every seed that they have.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have a big collection, but like one
of my favorites is from an old internet
[SPEAKER_13]: friend called The Mullum Madman.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was his father who would grow back
in the day and was involved with producing
[SPEAKER_13]: the Mullum Bimby Madness, which was just
this crazy plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: He used to post pictures of it on
Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like 18 feet wide and 12 feet high.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you get like 15 pounds of herb off of
it, but like 10 would still be on the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant in smalls that he wouldn't even
bother cutting out.
[SPEAKER_13]: He'd just make hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have seeds from his dad's
collection.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also have his seeds from like his own
version of it kind of thing, but he gave
[SPEAKER_13]: me like 30 seeds from his dad's original
collection.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have kept those things, geez,
for the last 22 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Australia for some reason has the most
diverse, like mutant type genetics that
[SPEAKER_09]: we've seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the Mullum Bimby Madness,
I think that supposedly had some Papua New
[SPEAKER_09]: Guinea something in it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, dude, like everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's which is one of the most
unique islands in the world, too,
[SPEAKER_09]: in terms of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have the duck's foot that came
from out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: The ABC, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: The Australian Bastard Cannabis,
which is the one that doesn't even look
[SPEAKER_09]: like weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the most interesting ones
that's happened recently is the,
[SPEAKER_09]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the one that looks like a fern.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: A freak show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a freak show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't think that one
necessarily has anything to do with
[SPEAKER_09]: Australia, but in terms of like
morphologically unique cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, three out of the four known
really weird ones are from Australia,
[SPEAKER_09]: or two out of three.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't see kangaroos anywhere else
in the world either.
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk about some tripped out shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The duck foot was the first one I ever saw
that ever had mutation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wally was posting that way long ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought Wally was in Central America
because of just the photos he used to post
[SPEAKER_05]: on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just assumed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, shout out to Wally Duck.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Wally Duck's hair.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, go ahead, Arka.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I grew out some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: The duck's foot pure, the duck's foot
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember what.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was one other cross that he had,
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've also grown like Hawaii webbed
indica, which seems potentially related
[SPEAKER_09]: or, you know, hybrid of something of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to quickly say that,
you know, shout out to Wally Duck for
[SPEAKER_13]: almost setting his hair on fire at one of
the first legends of hash dinners that we
[SPEAKER_13]: ever threw in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also shout out to Wally Duck for
literally carrying like 75 pounds of ice
[SPEAKER_13]: on his head, like a boss.
[SPEAKER_13]: And plus, like, I don't know, it was
probably like 105 degrees in the shade in
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamaica when me, him and Gypsy Nirvana
walked through the bush with a couple of
[SPEAKER_13]: Rastafarian dudes to the mountain of weed
that was a waiting us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was like this hour long,
hour plus long walk through the jungle to
[SPEAKER_13]: get to this mountain of weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had to carry, we all had to take
turns.
[SPEAKER_13]: And man, I'll tell you, both Gypsy and I
were looking pretty red when that that
[SPEAKER_13]: thing of ice was on our heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Wally being from Australia,
and he's a little guy, he's not a big
[SPEAKER_13]: dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just like, it was just nothing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could tell that the work ethic of an
outdoor Australian gorilla grower was no
[SPEAKER_13]: fucking joke for real.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that was legit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wally's the kind of guy you want coming to
visit on your farm, because he won't be
[SPEAKER_13]: sitting and hanging out on a hammock.
[SPEAKER_13]: He'll be like, I know exactly how this
works, and I'm going to put in the work to
[SPEAKER_13]: make sure it keeps working.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate people like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to Brandon's farm, he'll put you to
work, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, as you should.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are big sacks, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down and learned how to make hash
for Brandon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like I spent the weekend with
him and it was not just making hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like tending to the fields,
feeding the animals, shoveling shit into
[SPEAKER_05]: the the hugel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a bunch of work and it was a ton of
fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned so much more than just how to
make and isolate pure resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because to him, that is making hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: From the inside out.
[SPEAKER_08]: From the inside out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a lifestyle at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for sharing that with me,
Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, thank you for being one of the true
homies.
[SPEAKER_08]: You deserve it and well, you know,
respect it and shit, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people, there's some
fuckboys out there, I like to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that you respected it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You did it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You came correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what matters, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to feel like teaching hash is like
nighting a night or like kind of you have
[SPEAKER_08]: to like chill with Master Rofi.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to do the wax off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and like when you learn the shit like
that, then it's like this upper level of
[SPEAKER_08]: respect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big love, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big time, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my all time favorite thing back
in the day to do back in the early days
[SPEAKER_13]: when really it just it wasn't known like
nine point nine out of ten people I'd show
[SPEAKER_13]: it to would just be like, whoa,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, this is so crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a very unique time and I definitely
missed that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now being on a level where I don't I mean,
I I try to do as much as possible on that
[SPEAKER_13]: level, but I'm definitely more removed
from it than that being able to just have
[SPEAKER_13]: my greenhouse out behind the house and
have people come over and be like,
[SPEAKER_08]: all right, it's it's hella hard when you
don't have land.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even with some, you know, a lot of
people have land around here, but then you
[SPEAKER_08]: have to have the motivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like this big.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I got an acre, not an acre.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do a lot with that anchor.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, you know, it's just whether you
got the time or the means of doing and
[SPEAKER_08]: this and that, you know, it all comes
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I look I look up to the ones that,
you know, that food storage like a year's
[SPEAKER_08]: worth of food and not have to go to the
store at all to even buy food like we
[SPEAKER_08]: don't go to the store to get, you know,
grow material.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have to go sometimes to get,
you know, sugar or like milk or something
[SPEAKER_08]: like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we, you know, we raise our own poultry
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we knock things out like every year to
be like more sustainable and more off
[SPEAKER_08]: grid, but still like, you know,
have the lights running.
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was going to show off this real
quick because this is what Amanda's been
[SPEAKER_08]: doing while I've been doing this the whole
time as we're already figuring out what
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds we're planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all just veggies and flowers for
this upcoming year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a lot of pre planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is yeah, it's not even the herb
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not even the herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is appreciative.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good to live that inspirational life.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, who doesn't want to like have a
farm and have everything like be
[SPEAKER_13]: regenerative and sustainable and way
beyond what we now call organic?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more than just quality of resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like I eat, you know, three meals
a day and those have to be quality too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I say it all the time, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're going to smoke full melt hash,
why wouldn't you eat full melt resin and
[SPEAKER_13]: have full melt relationships and your
entertainment is full melt and everything
[SPEAKER_13]: is that it's just a bar that you set.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like this is this is what full melt
means to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what it means is that cleanness,
that purest, that just like perfectly,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, grown, sustainably grown
because, you know, a lot of stuff that we
[SPEAKER_13]: do nowadays is not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now it's catching up with the younger
generations.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're seeing all the things that have
been done are not so easily undone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that a lot of people get inspired
by what we do here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just tell them that you can go out
and just got to try to work together in
[SPEAKER_08]: your community and build something out of
nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the effort that beforehand no one
really wants to do because it's not,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, you're not custom and are not
used to doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just a little bit harder to get
that new new change.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: People just got to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it takes a long time to get to that
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know, Brandon, you've been
working your spot for like, what,
[SPEAKER_04]: nearly a decade or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it's it's not just overnight,
like, oh, look at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm dope now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like whatever thousands of followers on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of really hard work that you
put in day and night.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like your L's like you're losing
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the best teacher.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It totally is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like I said, it's a lifestyle at
this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: We eat, sleep and breathe this five acres
that we're on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it we're full blown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I can tell you how many days off I
have a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's probably like around a week of my
life is separate, you know, and it's full
[SPEAKER_08]: blown.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I love what I do, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and if I didn't do it, I don't know,
I wouldn't be doing as good for the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and that's what I woke up one
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got woke.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what it all came to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, how can I help the earth if I
can just stay on my property and just be
[SPEAKER_08]: smoted out and make this place fertile and
collect seed to ensure that that's my
[SPEAKER_08]: security?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's that's the quality of life.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, it goes deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it just goes deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a whole nother like different topic
of like everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're going to get into that
conversation on a hash church in a couple
[SPEAKER_13]: of weeks with the director and some of the
people that are a part of the need to grow
[SPEAKER_13]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_13]: That came out and you should definitely
come on as well, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Josh and Kelly are going to be
there and Dutch Blooms Joshua is going to
[SPEAKER_13]: be there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it'll be it'll be a good group.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll be amongst family.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can I can say that really,
really good hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Made me want it was one of the things that
made me want to grow my own food and is
[SPEAKER_10]: one of the things is one of the reasons
why I do grow my own food is because of
[SPEAKER_10]: what you said, if you're if you're dabbing
really, really good organic hash and
[SPEAKER_10]: you're sourcing it and you're growing it
like you might as well be eating six star
[SPEAKER_10]: two.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the minute the minute you're
educated to it, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're like, oh, that filter gets dropped
in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now you see everything through the six
star filter.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're like, oh, damn, like,
what's all the exactly wag in my life?
[SPEAKER_08]: I always say it actually provides like a
little like a really clear mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of health.
[SPEAKER_08]: People like, you know, I've got them
smoking an eighth or plus or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a good hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they call me up days later and say,
do my quality of life has increased?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's like, you know, I just say
that's that's that's the first step.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it starts thinking better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the destruction of the poisons fucking
clouding up the mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, one of my first customer letters
that one of the first women that bought
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble bags for me and sent me a letter
she wrote me a letter.
[SPEAKER_13]: She said her father was was elderly and he
was suffering from wasting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was very like maybe 90 pounds or
less.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was passing away from from not
being able to eat any food from from the
[SPEAKER_13]: drugs they had him on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so she had somehow seen like a video I
did on TV about water hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was like, I'm going to buy some
bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, she was at first it was
through emails.
[SPEAKER_13]: She finally sent me the thank you letter
that I'm about to get to the end of the
[SPEAKER_13]: story.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was mostly just emails, you know,
explaining to me, OK, I'm going to I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: going to go out on I'm going to go out in
the streets.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, she was from the Midwest and I'm
going to try and buy some marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she ended up finding like an ounce of
herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think she got burnt the first time.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like totally sketchy for this woman
to do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so she ended up doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: She got the herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: She went home and made the hash out of the
bubble bags from following the simple
[SPEAKER_13]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she so she had written me a letter
saying, you know, I did all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I basically put a little tiny bit of this
hash into my father's corn cob pipe.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like old.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he smoked this little bit of hash of
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically the big, you know,
she said he ate an entire chocolate cake,
[SPEAKER_13]: a McCain's chocolate cake.
[SPEAKER_13]: He ate the whole thing that night.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this motherfucker had not been eating
food, period.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_13]: At first, I laughed, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, oh, my God, because it's the
classic stereotype.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's make fun of the the stoners that
have the munchies.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just so much more profound when it's
like, what about the elderly man who's
[SPEAKER_13]: passing away from wasting syndrome,
who's now not only improving the quality
[SPEAKER_13]: of his life, but actually increasing the
quality and the extension of his life.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it was a very profound story to be
told, you know, like 1999, selling bubble
[SPEAKER_13]: bags, kind of just like more of a
connoisseur guy myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had come out of the B.C.
[SPEAKER_13]: Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did have that whole history of
helping the club and acquiring cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: for the club and getting busted for the
club.
[SPEAKER_13]: For those of you that don't know,
I started the bubble bag company after
[SPEAKER_13]: getting busted with a bunch of herb that I
had for the for the B.C.
[SPEAKER_13]: Compassion Club for Hillary Black's
Compassion Club, which I ended up going
[SPEAKER_13]: through court and getting no fine and no
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the judge even ordered the money be
given back.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was kind of a big deal at that time
when I had that happen, that I decided I
[SPEAKER_13]: wasn't going to be doing that anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: And working in the underground cannabis
world, I was going to like transition and
[SPEAKER_13]: create an above ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, really, it was my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who taught me because I would they caught
me with six grand cash and they called it
[SPEAKER_13]: proceeds of crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then my lawyer would be like,
hey, you owe me 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd give him like 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he'd throw it into like a paper
bag and put it on his front seat of his
[SPEAKER_13]: car and drive home.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, how the fuck is that not
proceeds of crime?
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's just like, well, you know,
because I went to school and got degrees
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'm a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you give me that money,
it's not proceeds of crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I figured, is there a way for me to
access money from the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_13]: and give them something back for it?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's, that's not breaking
the law, but still acquiring.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause man, let's be honest, everyone that
bought bubble bags since forever has
[SPEAKER_13]: bought those bubble bags with money that
they made growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like literally like 99.9% of people
that bought bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't, don't shush me, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it though.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just a little story.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I got six more minutes.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you guys, if Pua wants to chime in Pua,
you got the killer hash dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're on the island too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't you in like Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm in Oregon now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you are in Oregon, but you were,
weren't you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or were you just?
[SPEAKER_06]: During that last meeting I was in Hawaii
for my family late Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell us, tell us, tell us something,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you've got your, your thing that
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw your hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's straight fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you, you know, you a little bit of
your story, but we, I don't want to invite
[SPEAKER_13]: you on and then not have you say anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause all of us were so anxious to talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I value your opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so lately I just been messing with the
like wicking timing and the temperature of
[SPEAKER_06]: like the fridge that I use to,
uh, keep the hash in because I only air
[SPEAKER_06]: dry and seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with all these different cultivars,
like they, they have different timings to
[SPEAKER_06]: where they can become easily break apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: And two rough edges that touch deceive and
will just turn into dust by itself without
[SPEAKER_06]: having to really put pressure on it or
change the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like it because I get to see the
whole process of it becoming dry hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, definitely the way that the
cubicles and the wax is like, hold onto
[SPEAKER_06]: moisture and let go of them as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just have all different fields to them
and different textures.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I've just been messing with the
wicking time a lot lately, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially for really greasy strains that
like don't really yield very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, today I was doing a grape pie and,
um, I don't really like grape pie,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, uh, it's really greasy and really
hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if, if I got enough water out of it
fast enough on the screen in the fridge
[SPEAKER_06]: and it has to be down to like around 25,
I'm getting this like fridge too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, and it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what Fletcher was saying earlier
about, you know, terpenes, like sometimes
[SPEAKER_06]: don't freeze and like, you know,
it's crazy to play with that of how cold
[SPEAKER_06]: do you need to go to like work with it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like another strain that is easily
workable in like a 50 degree room.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, so I've been playing with that a
lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the past year, we've been like
really into looking at like chem crosses,
[SPEAKER_06]: cause we really like chem dog,
me and the farmer that I work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, a lot of it just has a lot of
waxy stuff, but when you go through a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch, you can finally find some that
release 5% and, um, and most of it's full
[SPEAKER_06]: melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, there's even some in the 180 and
the one we found lately in the chem to
[SPEAKER_06]: lechem has been our favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, even the 180 is clean and full
melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, honestly, the Rosanoff of it's
like the tastiest one out of all the
[SPEAKER_06]: microns from that strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretty cool strain and a really
cool plant from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and you're talking fresh frozen for a
5% yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fresh frozen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like damn near 20%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, so it's pretty sweet because we
really liked the chem dog profile and,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, we want to be able to have like nice
clean hash of it to you at a reasonable
[SPEAKER_06]: yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: To relate to that too, with the,
uh, freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, the, the best thing I've
found for retaining the most terpenes is
[SPEAKER_09]: really just getting as, as reducing the
amount of time it's under vacuum.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's obviously right place to start,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Removing as much water as you can before
you're putting it in to the, the vacuum
[SPEAKER_09]: while avoiding compaction, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it's like compressed on itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's hard, harder to freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so, you know, like I, I made those
screens for a while.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't have time to make them,
but that's, that's the thing that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we've had batches of hash that
dry in six to eight hours in the freeze
[SPEAKER_09]: dryer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Overall time or just final dry time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, just running final dry, basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, freeze it, chip it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So freeze it with, you know, hardly any
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically what you're trying to do is get
the water out of it really quickly through
[SPEAKER_09]: wicking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you pop it into your pre,
uh, frozen freeze dryer, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you pop it in it immediately,
like within a couple of minutes,
[SPEAKER_09]: the whole patty is frozen and you can
literally go in, break it up into chips
[SPEAKER_09]: and throw it back in on the screen and run
your cycle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like we've pulled stuff out at like
six hours and except for like the very
[SPEAKER_09]: thickest pieces, um, there'd be a little
ice in the center, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would be straightened, and some
varieties they'll be already be dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, that's the, you know,
that's not, you can't do that with
[SPEAKER_09]: everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was like smaller runs,
not big, whole trays full, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but that's just what I've seen is
basically removing as much, because all
[SPEAKER_09]: you're doing is removing water,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: During the process.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have less water volume to start
with, of course it's going to take less
[SPEAKER_09]: time to finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then increasing the surface area by
chip keeping it up and breaking it up as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that really helps as well too.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also being on a screen instead of
being on a tray where only one side's
[SPEAKER_09]: exposed, both sides are exposed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's all of these things together all
contribute to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the main one being, if you have let's
say 100 milliliters of water in a typical
[SPEAKER_09]: pour into your regular tray and you reduce
that to 15 milliliters, it's significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I saw that tech being used
was in Spain, Bobby Collada from La
[SPEAKER_01]: Collada was showing it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, although we had talked
to, I had talked to Space Greens over the
[SPEAKER_01]: phone one time with Frenchy and Nicotet
and we really didn't understand exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what he was saying when I saw it from
Bobby Collada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you, it was fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way significantly faster than the
dry, the final dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's called, that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That chipped, that chipped ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I use the freezer, I chipped my
ice no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I'm not using the Space Greens
tech, but I want to say that everything
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen from that has been pretty top
notch.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big shout out to Bobby Collada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Always has treated us amazing when we're
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_13]: He even made a private non-smoking room
for Skunk Man Sam and myself one year when
[SPEAKER_13]: we went up to try his dry sift.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Spain, they smoke so much,
both joints and cigarettes, and for him to
[SPEAKER_13]: make this little room within La Collada
that we could go and smoke.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it was basically just Sam and
myself in there and then Bobby and a few
[SPEAKER_13]: of the La Collada guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was very cool of him to do and it
was definitely above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those guys, no quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: They make great hash, dry sift as well as
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they have, they were the first ones
too that I saw laser etch logos and such
[SPEAKER_13]: into the rosin.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've seen a couple of people do it
since, but, and it's not like it's the
[SPEAKER_13]: most complex technology, but what a cool
thing to be the pioneer of.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I got, I got to give it to those guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where I saw it first.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate to cut it down because I could talk
with you guys for another hour easy,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I do have to go to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a place rented up there for the
weekend and it's my whole family is on the
[SPEAKER_13]: other side of the store.
[SPEAKER_13]: Literally my little guy's wearing his
pajamas right now, like bouncing off the
[SPEAKER_13]: walls, ready to go up to Whistler cause
he's got ski school.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's at eight o'clock in the morning
tomorrow and he gets to go, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're doing some avalanche training or
something.
[SPEAKER_13]: So imagine you're five years old and
you're going to the top of Whistler
[SPEAKER_13]: mountain to do avalanche training
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your day.
[SPEAKER_13]: So shout out to Tanner cause that's his
day and shout out to all of you for
[SPEAKER_13]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Best friend farms flat four two one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I'm going to see you sooner than
later.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dank Duchess and taste of Cascadia,
Pua extractions, heavy ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to hear more from you next
time, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we didn't get to hear from you
much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Archive Fletcher, it's super, super stoked
to have you show up, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: As well as Chris Kirk.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate you coming and sharing
with this man.
[SPEAKER_13]: All of you, great lakes, Greece and dammit
Bobby and Colin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all so much for making the first
episode of hash talk a good one.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had 400, 420 people watching the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll try to do it again next Friday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe with the same people, maybe with
some different ones, but thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do appreciate you guys all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.
