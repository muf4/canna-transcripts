[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting here with Chris Bennett.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just slayed the seawall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we did it one and a half
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say about two, but damn near two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only cut out that one little part,
but then we went through the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got off the beaten path and got told
we're not allowed to be on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, within about eight seconds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about eight seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Civilians in Vancouver, pedestrians are
very... I could see him approaching you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I could see you getting amped and
amped and I thought, oh, maybe we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to be on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we got off there pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want people riding on the... I
hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you, but at the same time... At the
same time, you don't want people... I see
[SPEAKER_04]: people on the bike path that go,
I go, bike path.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Responsible adult use is what I say.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: We complied and got off the pedestrian
paths.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about all you can really say when
you're...
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the wrong spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did the Z board and we did the Metro
board, two of the electric boards that
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris has.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted it on my Periscope account.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check me out there, bcbubbleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my Twitter account as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Periscope is a new app that lets you
live stream whatever you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever you're doing it from,
from pushing your button or your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of today's video is on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first part of the video that I
filmed on my actual camera and we got the
[SPEAKER_01]: mothership here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some rosin right here that I
pressed out with D420k the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks quite nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a couple of rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we go out on the boosted boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And head into Vancouver this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like the thing about the boosts
are way better kind of performance boards,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you only get about a third of the
radius out of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's, that's a major thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a major thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Radius is, you know, it's one of the
things you got to balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say the three things you look for
the major things are the radius that the
[SPEAKER_04]: board can make, the speed that it can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boosted Metro are supposed to be about 20
miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Metro is a little faster than
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the boosted is supposed to be 22 miles
an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say one of my boosted is faster than
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you a few seconds on the,
on the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the quartz gets pretty hot and this
is a very, oily substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually they'll wait 30 to 45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just give you like maybe 10 or 15
more seconds and then we'll hit you up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it in there to start melting it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin rips out of the Taurus.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now quick, give us some, uh,
something historical quick while you just
[SPEAKER_04]: barely can hang onto the mortal realm
after it like that, let alone getting into
[SPEAKER_04]: anything to articulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Z board is about twice as heavy as the
boost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I picked that up, I felt like,
wow, that's they've got a new bottle
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out in the summer in July and it's
rated for 24 miles and it's about as,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the same weight, I think as the,
uh, boosted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a lot smaller, you know,
much smaller battery box and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, well, I'm sure it's only going
to get better and bigger and faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say the Metro is about three pounds
heavy, but you know, again, it's got that
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 mile radius.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both those boards though, don't have flex.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hard decks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, if you're going over a lot
of bumpy terrain, this is true as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the thing I was really
missing from my scapegoat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Z board days, um, those things were
not very flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boosted, you could jump off that
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Metro, there's like a hesitation
when you engage, uh, maybe half a second
[SPEAKER_04]: or so, but it's still enough to notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you hit the forward or you hit
the thing, it takes just a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not as responsive as the,
like the handset for the boost is way
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Metro, the handset, you got to put
batteries in it, you know, that's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: so you got to always be changing
batteries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a rechargeable handset.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, um, you know, that's kind of a
pain is big too, you know, and you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: point it at the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works by a light coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That touches a light sensor on the deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you hold it in your back hand,
you could easily lose control of the
[SPEAKER_04]: board.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they need to just be
zipping along at a high speed and just be
[SPEAKER_04]: riding a normal board all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so that's kind of a bit of a
danger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, they, they say there's
warnings about the Bluetooth on the boost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cutting out, but I've never had,
my mind cut out ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just feel like way more confident
with the breaking and the core,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I'm looking forward to getting
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to have another rep?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was probably enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing altered my consciousness just
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say I'm in the same boat after
we've just done 22 or 21 kilometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one good rep out of the mothership is
really more than enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will catch you guys later.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check out more of these
videos, a periscope, uh, the app for your
[SPEAKER_01]: phone, you can link your Twitter and I'm,
I might do some more periscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, videos, but I might just go and
enjoy this ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for watching guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I decided to bring you with me
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to head into the city
from Stanley park here this time guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, we are now on the boosted board
that I saw was that kick it before you
[SPEAKER_04]: started because a lot of juice is used up
starting from the stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking from the stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not more than half and even when
it's still, yes, we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I love to love you
unconditionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by your actions, he calls reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can I love you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What goes around comes around.
[SPEAKER_03]: What goes up comes down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to break away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many changes going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't know what they're bringing
changes going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested to find out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Changes will be possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes will be positive for you and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes will be positive for you and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many changes going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't know what they're bringing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what's the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested to find out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Changes will be possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes will be positive for you and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today now we're asking what's going to
be for the future for you and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today now we're asking what's going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it be cold days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it be good days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes will be positive for I and you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes will be positive for you and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes will be positive for I and you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes will be positive for you and I.
