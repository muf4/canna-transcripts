[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World here with
John H.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beerfellow on a beautiful Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out as always brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a pleasure to have you out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess today we're going to be doing a
little bit of dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some dry sifting with D420K last
week in Prince George and although I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought it was going to be more of a video
where I would be involved, I felt that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was really cool to show D420's techniques
that he's learned from getting his resin
[SPEAKER_02]: to a pure state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today I wanted to go over really more
the technique that I shared with him
[SPEAKER_02]: initially and show that you can actually
card a little bit harder than what people
[SPEAKER_02]: think you can card.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to really show the carding process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do an initial bounce with Mehdi
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: John will do his gentle bounce over his
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's always nice to just let the
grower do that initial bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun really makes it look good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take a few shots for you before we
bounce this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just put a couple of the nugs aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a couple of pictures and then we'll
put that over the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go through, it's going to be a quick
video today of dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably you should turn that D-nail on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go, get that going because I'm
sure we're going to need a D-nail hit
[SPEAKER_02]: sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the air pressure pump pumped up
to about 75 PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to just do a quick clean on
these screens because John's noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a little bit of resin on them from
last time and he wants his resin
[SPEAKER_02]: uncontaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to actually hold this screen up for
me and I'll blow it through like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that one down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice forced pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see this one, there's quite a bit
of more powder in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be every single drop of
powder, but we'll just use all the air we
[SPEAKER_01]: have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather not turn the pump on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That basically gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that cleaned us up a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always use your hand as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of dust falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of resin heads everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all these little heads
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our 70 micron we're going to put
on the bottom if you want to pass me the
[SPEAKER_02]: 140.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back in a few seconds when we put
the herb on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm belting all the resin off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely don't want to play around
in the bag too much like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, it's cold, I'll tell you
that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is chilly out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gentle bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really nice looking herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even see the little resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the little balls there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a few hair in here, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have cats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they usually find their way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're getting rid of all the
chafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hairs are going to have a hard time
getting their way through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I normally do is I just do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many ways to extract the resin off the
buds, and it's a personal choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's directly related to also cleaning
of the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more gentle you are, the less cleaning
you're going to do, the rougher you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, after initially doing this,
you could get to the point, two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: sifts down the line, where you grind this
into powder, and then you run it through a
[SPEAKER_02]: tumble now or a tumbler, four by two
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically run it through screen as powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a very, very low grade material,
but there's resin to be had in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even, funny enough, I know it's a
misnomer and it goes against dry sifting,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can actually make dry sift,
large quantities of it, and run it through
[SPEAKER_02]: bags afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it run through, through water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you're going to lose your
water-soluble terpenes and it will defeat
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the fact, but it's still an easy
way to run a large amount of product into
[SPEAKER_02]: a smaller amount of product, and then run
that into actual final product heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, this is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, but I love the full mouth,
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This herbs just beautiful in the sun
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with this, see all this,
how can I harvest just those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all those heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to go through the
screen, so those are actually made of your
[SPEAKER_00]: head totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like little granules of
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's carding a lot heavier as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, showing people that there's a
different way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being so gentle here that you're
not carding the actual heads through.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trapped in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just do a little bit of carding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much, because there's a lot of
contaminant in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, this is 140 micron screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely the potential that all
the 160, all 140 or 150 heads in bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: will end up staying on top of the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally, our favorite heads aren't
in that range anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our favorite range is between 120,
140, and 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said, I always love just
that first bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to fall through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I collect right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I start slowly breaking down
these bumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to grab that first bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I see?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at me there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're going to take a hit of this
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that first bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the best for the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to pick it up so I can put
the screen back down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Load her up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice gentle sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see from 100 grams, you got a
bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: About one, maybe two rips of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're going gentle, you're
obviously being extremely inefficient in
[SPEAKER_02]: your extraction rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going for the nicest heads that you
can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, at one point, we're also going to
show you getting this herb down to a
[SPEAKER_02]: better state and getting it actually some
product run through here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once we have that, we'll get back
into the carding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does take a while, so we're not going
to show you the 40 minutes that it takes
[SPEAKER_02]: me to clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a half an hour to 40 minutes,
I can clean a nice little pile of dry sift
[SPEAKER_02]: with the carding technique and get a nice
melting bubbly final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that herb right there on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grab a couple nice buds out
of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some randoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denail rips in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest, as you can even see it just
flaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that when you break it,
it's nice and cold out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you break it, you get to see the
dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear them snap too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, John's going to do this for
a little while longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to come back at the point
where we've got resin to work with on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom screen, because that's really the
part I want to show you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just getting a little rougher now with
the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's worked the pile of smaller debris,
worked it down the way I was showing,
[SPEAKER_02]: carded it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he's got the smaller nuggets out
and he's going to be doing a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more bouncing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will probably get to the point with
this, if John wants to get all the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: off of it, where we will powderize this
herb and we'll tumble it for not too,
[SPEAKER_02]: too long, but for certainly long enough
that we're certain that we've gotten all
[SPEAKER_02]: the glands out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at that point, I'll probably
clean that resin for John, because that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of resin becomes extremely difficult
to clean when you've got 10% heads versus
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% contaminants, sometimes even higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to our secondary carding real
soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people wear gloves, but I like to
touch my resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Son of a DK.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420's resin is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharon, the lovely herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm loving these new carb caps from
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really sweet the way they're machined
and they just fit right in the D-Nail bowl
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I load you one up, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do this part as you get me
ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corner of the screen, secured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you like the... Well, yeah,
that gives me kind of more of that...
[SPEAKER_02]: Right-hander to left-hander.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what a perfect drop that was,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice little slit in this
particular carb cap, so it just lets you
[SPEAKER_02]: keep taking a perfect hit without really
much worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure is a beautiful day out here
[SPEAKER_02]: for as mildly chilly as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do this initial harvest of resin
heads, you get dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can clean this and you can see
underneath that there's stuff that's worth
[SPEAKER_02]: having, but it's still quite dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we spread it as thin as we can and you
end up left with a cleaner and cleaner
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how clean I got this one right here in
a real quick hurry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to... Well, I think there's a
decent amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the very gently card.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to push through a ton of
contaminant, but we want those heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just need a little bit of help to
go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, vibration would be helpful in this
particular instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vibration, tumbling, any of these
varieties are going to be helpful for
[SPEAKER_02]: extracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we've gotten that quarter
pound broken down nicely into smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting smaller and smaller as John
works it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea as he does this,
like at this point I would have him
[SPEAKER_02]: separate the nugs out, get all his nugs
separated out and do another one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: gentle cardings over the dust that's left
and separate the chafe from that dust,
[SPEAKER_02]: card that dust through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Card that dust through and then move to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have gave in because that's just
what you do when it's money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gently, I'm not really crushing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of more gently...
[SPEAKER_02]: These nugs still have a tiny bit of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: For dry sift, I guess if we knew 100% that
we would have dry sifted this,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would have been out and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is still dry, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, we're going to dry sift that
one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to crush that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're medicine, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be able to do the quality anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might also do it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it makes it over here, it's going to be
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will we run that through the tumbler
later?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try doing that and that's
what I have in that little jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to just clean that herb up off
the screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty much down to nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get down to our next screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little popcorn, tiny tiny little hard
buzz will work really well for medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: and definitely when doing the secondary
screen and we start carding, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to wear a long sleeve shirt like
John's wearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see his cuff going in the herb
each time he picks it up and that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: for the herb, it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will get fibers in there, but for
the... I personally don't... I just would
[SPEAKER_02]: wear a short sleeve shirt if you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, like you said earlier,
the gloves and just any way to secure the
[SPEAKER_02]: material and keep it as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give the final screen a wipe
before you lift it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a blow even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I've realized is you always get
a little bit of flakes on your body and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and you lift it up and it gets full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to actually pick this up
and move the screen over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give this card a quick clean as soon as
you use all the cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the color looking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we photograph it with the macro
lens before we move it all off the screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a close up as I'm pushing this in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do a quick one.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the color looking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we photograph it with the macro
lens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we move it all off the screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a close up as I'm pushing this in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do a quick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collected our sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Single screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a small amount of macro
photography on what's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice pile of near, I would say it's a good
50% heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% not heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because we're collecting this to flip
to the other side of the screen,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get the shadow out of the way so
I'm going to put this on the other side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a plate there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for a clean one for that last little
trickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now we've got a little bit
more in the sun for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see this is our one hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the whole screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do 20 like it's, if you see dirt,
get her clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we definitely don't want to,
um, put beautiful hash down on a dirty
[SPEAKER_02]: screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like John just pointed out,
if you see a hair, you see anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a time where taking your time is a
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautifully stuck to the plate,
not moving at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good sign right off the bat considering
you guys know how powdery this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be carding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like it to somewhat fall back on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get all of that off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blowing a little wind in the, in the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going to do our carding in
order to do our carding technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to, we want to card a small amount
at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice small amount at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear the sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resident is definitely prevalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can, everyone's going to want
to get in a larger amount if you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: feel the difference on the efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like a small amounts just
taking too long, try a larger amount and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see that it's actually going to
slow you down even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I usually separate my grade,
my initial from what I card.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when it's nice to have one of
those brushes that D420K has as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice little cards to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to push through contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to push a good amount of it
through I don't doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is always the case and because it's
cold right now, it's actually working
[SPEAKER_02]: quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even see it somewhat sticking,
the contaminants sticking in the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically this is a process that we'll
do until we can get the resin as clean as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've shown this on camera before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've shown this process of basically
carding this resin back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see that you're losing quantity
and you're gaining quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to work this small pile of
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be carding for the next, oh I'd say
35 to 45 minutes easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll bring this down to a much
cleaner, purer product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it already looks really much whiter
than the gold pile that I have over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're cleaning off the little
pieces, there's these little pieces that
[SPEAKER_02]: will gather up on your cards here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to clean those up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep them out of your hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them over to the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a nice quality and they're
definitely not to be thrown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're something that will definitely
mess up the carding process good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll continue on cleaning and carding
and we'll come back and show you the final
[SPEAKER_02]: product and do a little puff down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun has set and I'm not sure if I'm
going to show it to you before the video
[SPEAKER_02]: or right at the last thing but it was
definitely a beautiful sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice orange color in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we cleaned up some of this dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a few different piles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of see the different colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one looks pretty top grade right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably have a few rips of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of carding.
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole lot of carding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carding for probably an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll show you some macro shots as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we give you a pile of the goodness
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've taken the ceramic tip off for the
time being.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over here if you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to go deep in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, just drop her in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and bubbly and melty.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that take?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I'm going to make the
attempt on some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's what I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's the taste now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that untaste is very deep egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was beautiful flowers about an hour
and a bit ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's just like really super tasty,
incredible dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a thumbs up experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still more resin to be taken off that
herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by no means the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we call the cream of the
cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The holy grail hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still run that bud through the wet
wash method and probably get four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: or six percent return on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could definitely, even after doing
that, run it through a coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soak it in coconut oil and extract the
last of the the heads that are in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and just continue to use the plant right
down to the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want people to think of this as a
waste, but this is definitely... The next
[SPEAKER_00]: part for me is I actually throw in a pot
with some butter and boil it down to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some nice for for edibles.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're getting it with some
sort of a fat and you're extracting that
[SPEAKER_02]: last little bit of resin, then this is
could never be considered a waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only is to be considered something you
do in order to not sacrifice your best for
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bake my stuff in the oven
with some tin foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that doesn't sound as good as
extracting the heads off with screens and
[SPEAKER_02]: puffing pure cotton.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very, very... That's definitely the
last of the last.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of throwing it away, you
decarboxylate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure how much would be left if
you soaked it in butter or oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: but probably a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully you guys have learned a
little bit today that you can card a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit harder.
