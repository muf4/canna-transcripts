[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome to the wonderful world of high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity glass art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just been so lucky as to take the
most epic rip of chemo full melt bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash out of this Fab Klein Taurus or Fab
Taurus Klein, whatever you want to call
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 88 opals on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an absolute work of art,
flower of life, or seed of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along the bottom, big giant trippy perk
in the bottom of the, just above,
[SPEAKER_00]: below the Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an unbelievable piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it's got a dosa crushed opal
mothership honey bucket on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a little sweet skunk dry sift
that we just literally pressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the one here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just pressed out a little of the sweet
skunk dry sift powder that is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's time to light this honey
bucket up because my goodness,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, that's outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big torch fan, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They scare me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really, really incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go as far as saying it's the most
beautiful piece I've ever ripped to date
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not only is it one of the most
beautiful pieces I've ever hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: because truly I'm not sure if it's
transferring onto the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This piece is absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opal work and how perfectly encased in
clear glass that they are and the colors
[SPEAKER_00]: that are accessible to us through the
glass of the opals is absolutely above and
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond anything I've ever seen in a glass
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, big up the mothership for
producing such an unbelievable piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, Scott Deppie and your team of
talented artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big up high integrity glass art for
having such an epic piece here in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to be able to come and rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to Bulb Man's world and
welcome to the wonderful world of high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity glass art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here visiting with high integrity
glass art and they have been so gracious
[SPEAKER_00]: as to allow me to hit this, I would call
it a one of a kind, Fab Klein Taurus or
[SPEAKER_00]: Fab Taurus Klein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to argue with you guys what
it's called because I'm the one holding it
[SPEAKER_00]: and about to hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 88 opals on this masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken some beautiful photos and I'll
share those with you during the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice pull on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the original honey bucket that came
with it I've shown you is not on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dosa that's on here and it hits
beautiful and for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the one we're going to be using
today with this 88 opal masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some congolese on the titanium
dabber here, the highly educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be very nice to taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure to hit some
congolese resin, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you can hold this piece of glass
with all these opals on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimized flavor zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This zone is the zone I'm currently in.
