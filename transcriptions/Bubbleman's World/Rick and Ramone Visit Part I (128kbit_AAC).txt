[SPEAKER_06]: Well it didn't take long.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabbing it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flav's in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: You always see Flav's glass before you see
Flav.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, so we had a little adventure getting
you guys here, but you're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to Cuban.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just weird to sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't been in that situation since I
was really young.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always got hope.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got you now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the truck.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're rolling on a little adventure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually going to get the boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Figured it's kind of a nice day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like almost 20 degrees Celsius,
which is I don't know what in American.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a button for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well we're going to have an
adventure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking you guys along with us,
so you'll be experiencing the madness of
[SPEAKER_06]: Rick and Ramon in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that world tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, you want to dab or no?
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently we've been in this slow ass
traffic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how many hours?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this motherfucker doesn't know how
to dab and drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally fucked up, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, there it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're all good now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rubber necks are done.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they were doing is slowing down
and watching that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we've totally flailed and
didn't film any of our last session.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good session too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sublimated.
[SPEAKER_06]: We de-nailed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heavy session.
[SPEAKER_06]: We L.H.O.ed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We bubble hashed down.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we ended up, now we are on our way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We dropped the boat off just at the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we are on our way to Squamish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we're in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Squamish.
[SPEAKER_06]: British Columbia Squamish.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just about to head up to Squamish
downtown.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are picking up that dirt bike that
I went and got with John the other day in
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're giving you the update.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably have a little session and a
nice meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to remember to bring you guys along
with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we're on our way to get that
dirt bike now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: This place looks like a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: This place looks like fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: This shit is crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]: You got that shit right there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Outlander.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a fucking beast, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are we getting?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a half a dozen of these?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, six of these and we're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six of these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we get three in yellow?
[SPEAKER_06]: God.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're obviously joking, but man,
I love me some toys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love me some toys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even this thing looks hella fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks fun as fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool how you have to do it for miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Road Tap.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks fun too, though, right there,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they got the Ski-Doo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the new 500.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit is sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't have those.

[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very close to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very close to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the pub, we just had them wings and
some of them things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That salmon burger was very, very serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did way too much business.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now smoke time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo or Kush?
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to pull right in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be the look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going to park.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to park like a narc.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to park?
[SPEAKER_06]: How close to that car am I?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my whole back open and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty damn close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're getting kind of close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how close?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like click.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're that close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a close crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say you got a body like a foot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a body in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Squamish police.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's integrated police.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the integrated police services.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, this was some fucking tightness.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is six-point parking.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Charlie Murphy shit right here.

[SPEAKER_06]: How about the honeybee?
[SPEAKER_06]: Honeybee!
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's the rumblebee.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that want to know what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the rumblebee.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the rumblebee right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very yellow truck with like a
wasp type of bumblebee on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Derbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Derby time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Derbs.

[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to do a parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we got in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Parchment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a bubble bag card.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a bubble bag card?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to use the not so hot side
and just flatten it like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got like a funky, funky, funky field
tip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a Dewey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Funky field tips are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nish makes those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Funky Field Tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how it says Cypress Hills Funky
Field Tips and not Be Real's Funky Field
Tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gives them props.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are pretty pricey though,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, they should be given to
you if you're a lead star.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool little product.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me this one, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me two.
[SPEAKER_03]: One came in a little case.
[SPEAKER_06]: This way for Dubays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we heating up that torch?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm patting out some fucking... Here,
let me heat up that torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do some torch heating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's up first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, here we are in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Squamish, Squamish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also called Squampton.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a little truck session.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's such a beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could have easily gone to some epic
nature site and got outside and had a
[SPEAKER_06]: session there, but sometimes you got to
puff in the truck, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull over on the side of the road and just
do it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just chuff it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Derbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's derb time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Derb, derb, derb, derb, derb, derb,
derb, derb, derb, derb, derb, derb,
derb, derb, derb, derb, derb.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little on the gozer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't want to wait, we could just
have the two rigs going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a double derby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hits like a little champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does hit like a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have that water in there still?
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing takes the smallest amount of
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my Barcelona, well, not this year,
but last year's Barcelona special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the good one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the good good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little high on that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fucking good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are smoking some of the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Congolese is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like the Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good, the Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it derb, sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony Zamboni.
[SPEAKER_05]: The little flower mate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever see this little guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's rolling in his caddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a body in the lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's unicorn tails on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is it unicorn tails, y'all?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unicorn tails with drugs on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you need a dab, sir?
[SPEAKER_05]: We got one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you hushed some shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on point, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just pull some seven star up from
the fucking side here, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just pull some seven star.
Let me just pull some seven star.
