[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in beautiful Stanley Park,
Vancouver with my good buddy Johnny B,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, it's so good to see you,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, strong, firm grip on Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: That never used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm re-meeting my friend for the first
time here and we figured, what a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking day to hit Stanley Park and puff
some hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we got the turps, all many flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, rosins and dry sips and wet washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot the D-nail, unfortunately,
but luckily yesterday for my birthday,
[SPEAKER_01]: my wife got me a big shot GT 8000.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said it was quite funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: She went into the CCHQ and she said,
yeah, you know, I'm looking for a torch
[SPEAKER_01]: for my husband and they're like,
oh, well, you know, if he's a big dapper,
[SPEAKER_01]: he'll want the big shot GT 8000.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, is he a big dapper?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, well, he's Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my first ever torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a crème brûlée toy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a crème brûlée toy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost mine yesterday on the Sunshine
Coast, but I had two of them and this came
[SPEAKER_01]: the same day I lost the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the torch I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got the Hive Quave Club Banger
that was just sent to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got this little guy that we're going
to be hitting off today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that my puking beagle actually
carbs it really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be using that for a
carb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the mothership Taurus for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you want to hit first?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Congo dry sips for your
birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congo dry sips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hit some Congo dry sips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice catch with the quick, uh,
my reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a quick reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go for a nice little dunk on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little dunk and doodle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it was is I found this bag of
Congo in my closet and it definitely had
[SPEAKER_01]: your name on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I think last time on your
birthday, we smoked Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't it make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a nice clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only a one static pass because I
didn't have time to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know it melts and I know you're
going to love the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the one thing with these club
bangers is you really just have to gauge
[SPEAKER_01]: the time that you hit them for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure it's especially this early on
in its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt that it will turn any different
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can get them orange eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but, uh, and I've always been told
to hit these like, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just hold the torch in one spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure someone out there is laughing at
how I'm heating this up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, he's totally fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble man doesn't know how to use a
fucking torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of don't know how to use a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big torch guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: First torch ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get the feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my hand usually to, uh, it's windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to gauge the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got helicopters all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather hit it a little cooler than a
little hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cooler nail gives you a better flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wind is cooling it down wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm the guy who used to hit
a hot nail because it worked so well for
[SPEAKER_01]: my pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted a hot hit that hit me hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really realized that those flavor,
low temp flavors are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different flavors, different temps give
you a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it perfect temp?
[SPEAKER_01]: I counted about 15 seconds on about a 15
second heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have just cleaning off my carbon for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I'll torch it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, see, I, I did this hash
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because I'm running around,
I like, I haven't even tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll just give it to Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another funny experience in Jamaica
with Bobo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me for a bud and I didn't have
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I talked about the Jamaica or the
Toronto thing and how bad I felt because I
[SPEAKER_01]: had just given your bud away to Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Bobo came up and asked for
the bud, I just wasn't able.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was like, dude, I can't,
it's not my bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already tried the giving it away and it
didn't really work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't work out very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had another funny experience in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ridiculous, but funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was definitely a, he was an awesome
cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy crawled into the bushes,
like really went in the backyard and
[SPEAKER_01]: walked up a tree and came down with,
with all kinds of awesome fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember all that,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing it good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're in the middle of nowhere
and he brings food out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta chef like nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, we're in the middle of a ganja
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy starts cooking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's straight up dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to puff a couple of bowls
and a couple of different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: park just to show you the beauty and have
a little conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also brought the drone out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought we would show you a little
bit about like the aerial view of where we
[SPEAKER_01]: are right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to do an aerial view of each
spot, but probably towards the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I'm not sure I should be puffing and
droning simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the ceramic bowl, the banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hit it at the right time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hit it a little early,
a little late?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit that thing perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some experience in this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a cook ski for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been trained in puffing full
melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trained in puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sift and bubble hash by you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last few years, man, I mean,
I was talking with my friend today about
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, we said we were just scratching
the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got terpenes and we got sifts and
this and rosens and it's just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the bubbles and all the different
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much we have, what gets
pulled out first?
[SPEAKER_01]: The sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: The full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always the sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: The full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who in their right fucking mind would say
anything other than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think someone that maybe doesn't have
all of the choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, we are all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's someone out there that's
completely fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to just smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We support you if you're out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all insane in our own rights and I
think it's time for a little drone
[SPEAKER_01]: footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was stoked that you had your phone
hooked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, he's like, he just started smiling
because I'm like, what's all that about?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, that's my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, that's my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, kidding me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so don't put your hand here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is hella fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to leave that camera on so we
still have the audio and we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: send this bad boy off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say like, when we've seen
them, I know people have had them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely like a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it like quarter around a pound and
drop it off?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, definitely one of the things
they say about these is to not apply
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not put any weight on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I like how the camera moves back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm still trying to like learn it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so in other words, don't sit right
here when he turns it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hits the titanium in my neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: No titanium in Johnny's neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently it's going to kill you battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: No daddy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: No daddy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually hooked up to the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for some reason they don't have
internet connection in Stanley Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that was really, really,
really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too fucking bad, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, like honestly, whenever we get
together, we do crazy cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do one more bong rip and go find
another zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blew all that shit all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's like everywhere, like shh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at us, it's like woo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we're having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's, let's hit some of what I
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the easiest to dab will be this
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know when you do something
and you're like, you remember when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: kids and you get all excited and you're
like woo, that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I am right now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do this and they're like woo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's freaky too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, holy shit dude, we sent that
thing like a kilometer away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like, and it was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I've never, I've seen them,
I've heard of them, but to actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: beside and witness it and see it in front
of you, I'm like come to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be like shh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all, you know, I didn't actually
bring it up, but I meant, I guess I was
[SPEAKER_01]: meant mentioning that I was editing videos
while insuring my truck today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the insurance lady's like,
oh, I heard you say something about
[SPEAKER_01]: videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say you had a drone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mentioned I was going to fly the
drone with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, yeah, yeah, I'm like,
yeah, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all kind of like stoked to brag about
my drone, kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, but a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, yeah, we have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: XRXT77.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, names this thing off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, wow, that sounds like it's 20
grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, oh, all said and done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 120K.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: She just shames my drone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, your little mini drone is cute,
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got one with about 100 grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does high-end digital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the whole thing about
technology, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the whole thing about
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's important for the gimbal to be
held in place when in storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has to be done so it can deliver a
gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well made, but one of the things
they say right off the bat is to not put
[SPEAKER_01]: stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: To not offset the balance of it because it
is a fairly precise instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say we have to put a gram on
each corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it would definitely somehow be able
to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to do a gram delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you have to put it right on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then scrape it off, just rosin,
just press it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll watch the drone fly into
the ocean in the most hilarious of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is the footage will be
on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the best part, we didn't lose
footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the footage is on the chip on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only watch it through that wire
that I have set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somehow we have to record it while
watching the drone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't go into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely a new perspective on taking
a better look at a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm curious on the laws around
drones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we fly them downtown Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we fly them outside of the apartment
building?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no-fly zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go online and find out where they
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-fly zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Airports are big no-fly zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I can't fly these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not near your airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can definitely fly it around your
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the Fraser River and get
unbelievable footage all up and down the
[SPEAKER_01]: river.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can wait for someone to catch a
sturgeon and go... I was on top of Better
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went for a little trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bringing that thing up there and seeing
the world is so high and overlooking all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the valley would be so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go on the Argo, I can set it to
track us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to do this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just push a button and it follows us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said if.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ifs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ifs or ands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm gonna have to wait probably
another... I'm gonna wait till the surgeon
[SPEAKER_01]: on May 17th gives me the okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew my lid was blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like see that's a fly zone right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably couldn't fly the drone over
the water there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go on the website too and check it
out and make sure we're not breaking any
[SPEAKER_01]: unnecessary laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a responsibility too to
make sure that you're not creeping people
[SPEAKER_01]: out, flying near people's homes and
looking in their windows and that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm avoiding that at all costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to have fun with my drone and
get some footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely don't want to be stepping
on anyone's toes unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Johnny B's second dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna head over to the totem poles,
get some more drone footage and we'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we found ourselves another
zone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little bench in front of a big vast
open field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of on a peninsula in the back
of it and there's North and West Vancouver
[SPEAKER_01]: over there and then you have Vancouver,
the convention center in downtown over
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought we would A, puff some more
bowls out of Johnny's little heady piece
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little West coast concentrate,
120 micron green crack God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'll fire this drone up and get a
little bit of the footage so I can enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: my bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll, we got planes, we got
helicopters, we got army.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a whole, a whole wide variety of
things in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to put one more up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of, maybe we can get some,
some views of some other airplanes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's see what we can do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my aircraft engaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aircraft engaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear that sound, you know there's
an aircraft being engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's take off, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stab that out, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's initializing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a little bit of an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The IMU reinitializes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'll just take a few seconds
before it does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMU is initializing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not move the aircraft until
initialization is complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull it out gently and a little bit of,
you know, loosen a bit and then flip the
[SPEAKER_01]: jar upside down in your hands and then
press it in between your fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I mean.
That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: After realizing that flying drones over
Stanley Park is illegal, we decided to go
[SPEAKER_01]: get some Nance pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're going to do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of them apples?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some weight to that pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the cheese pizza is heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it weighs like three pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how much I love pizza,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bon appetit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was some delicious pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some good illegal drone flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now know that we can't fly it on the
beach or in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to go to some
different spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one area, that's a little iffy
because it was just a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think, you know, it wasn't that
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do know for future, we're not
flying it outside of buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for watching Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good chilling with you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see you guys next time.
One, two, one, five.
Bye.
Bye.
