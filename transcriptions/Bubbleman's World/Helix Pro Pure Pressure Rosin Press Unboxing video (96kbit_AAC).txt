[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here today, fresh after Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's a couple of days after
Christmas, the 27th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you all had a wonderful holidays and
enjoyed your time with your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a kid on Christmas morning
because I have a new package from Pure
[SPEAKER_01]: Pressure in Colorado, my favorite rosin
press company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that this is either the
Helix or the Helix Pro manual rosin press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to do an unboxing video with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with the
Helix Pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put the picture up here real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Helix Pro is a five ton manual rosin
press.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are expected January 2019,
so they're doing 25 pre-orders for this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got bigger heat plates and more force
than the Helix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exclusive pre-order pricing is a
thousand bucks down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, three weeks before
shipping you can pay the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's another $2,900 for this
particular unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every pre-order comes with a free matching
accessory kit and entry into their contest
[SPEAKER_01]: where one is going to win a second press
for free for a friend or for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So top features, user friendly and easy to
twist press operation, no air compressor
[SPEAKER_01]: required, ultra accurate force measuring
load cell which displays bag pressure in
[SPEAKER_01]: real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a market first for manual rosin
press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super responsive pressure control that
allows for as little as 10 pound force
[SPEAKER_01]: increments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press up to 12 grams of flowers or 20
grams of key for hash at a time with ease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Features are press wear technology which
offers a full color LCD touchscreen with
[SPEAKER_01]: custom software for even more control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can save up to 29 preset recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you dial in your settings,
you can repeat your results over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to five tons of force which is 10,000
pounds of force.
[SPEAKER_01]: Output from our 100% custom engineered
lead screw twist press technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have put a lot of time and
energy into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trust me when I say these guys
understand engineering and they really
[SPEAKER_01]: produce their rosin presses from an
engineer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how the machine is getting built.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even heat distribution from zero
Fahrenheit to 300 Fahrenheit from our
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house machined aluminum plates,
each with its own thermal couple,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature accuracy to less than one
degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultra durable powder coated construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, they're patent pending.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just such a pleasure when my Long
Peaks showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved the way they shipped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved everything about how they packaged
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really quite a pleasure to
open that package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of have a feeling this one's
not gonna be too different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just crack off this lid and see
what's inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, nice padded lid there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That over there, actually right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well get it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they have, oh, just a little bit
of papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your invoice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got your invoice right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got rosin bag filters, which is
quite nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a photo of it and put it up on
the screen so you can see about their
[SPEAKER_01]: press molds, their specialized scraping
tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the funnel kit, the quick flip,
the bag sizes, the screen sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these different things are pretty
important to kind of know where you sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How rosin is pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a really nice little folder,
which I will also photograph and put up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the screen so you can look at that and see
the different screen sizes and from flower
[SPEAKER_01]: to keaf to bubble hash and the different
tips for the different things and the
[SPEAKER_01]: consistencies and the textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have really been doing a great
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say, working with them has been an
absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they also have a little card in there
for the HarvestRite pharmaceutical freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the top right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be careful with our knife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always gonna be somewhat careful when
you're using a knife, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're opening a package that you don't
know exactly how it's been shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these look like the little feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put those down over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four of them, so that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, what else we got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, I guess this is the feet of the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen these enough times to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: These go on the side of the machine with
the feet that screw into them,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that should be easy enough to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on the unboxing video,
let's just screw these right into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how much we should leave,
but probably a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the right height.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the other one in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I love about PurePressure is just the
quality of the craftsmanship.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that this came from a real
engineering standpoint, and they put a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of thought into putting this unit
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely not something that is a
fly by the seat of your pants
[SPEAKER_01]: construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do an incredible job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might actually cut this whole box away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than try to lift out the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what we're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you a little show on what's going on
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure exactly what all these components
are, because I've never seen this unit
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing it really for the first
time with me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure which of these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, this is our little handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that little guy right there for
cranking it on the top of the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And onto this one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not as heavy as I thought
it might be, which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This definitely just goes down right on
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your handle gets inserted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the screws are actually right in the
unit, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take this off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how easy this goes on and off,
and it doesn't seem to need to be locked
[SPEAKER_01]: in place, which is very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suspect these are going to go like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also put this unit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually have it like this set
up, where it's sort of horizontal versus
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both options are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I already got the one leg on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things with these guys that I
make a bit of a mistake is they'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny little bend on their foot,
and naturally I'll think that the feet go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually the opposite of how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the feet go in, the unit
builds up, and there's three little Allen
[SPEAKER_01]: keys right here in the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fairly easy to unscrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be using a drill and making it
even easier, but I'm using an Allen key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I love the way the screws just come
in in place in the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to look for a little bag
and try and find the screws.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just go to where you're going to be
screwing them in, and they're already
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of removing them and
then screwing them in to secure the feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's done because the feet
can go on a variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way they've got it set up,
you can put it vertical or horizontal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, alright, let's get this up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the threading is just really done
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be problematic where
your screws aren't screwing in nicely or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going in sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything just lines up really,
really well on these units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure they're tight on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, yep, and yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes with a power cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the same great digital screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love the little screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the look of this little unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I figured we should do a
little press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little bit of canvas here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like we can press a solid 12
grams of flour at a time on this little
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take the little flip
tool that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the screen over top here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 115 micron screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to flip it inside out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to get that seam on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, and it'll hold a lot less oil
as contaminants, capturing oil that we
[SPEAKER_01]: really would rather have released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my little funnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to put on my gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got our little bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our little 12 grams of herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, of course, pressing my all-time
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just such a great flour to press.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it truly, really releases an incredible
amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone off about these tools before,
but I might as well a little bit again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the ease with which these
tools operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got quite a bit of extra room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not going all the way to
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a nice little bit of screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just be able to fold over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought my pure pressure template here
for pre-pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pre-press plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put those two ones over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a nice flattened piece here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the older one that I took from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have some paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sent me, once again, some screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of varieties of screens here,
which I was very happy I'll be doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting, including stainless steel
screens right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sent me some stickers, which I will be
giving away to some folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they even sent me a new funnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get this opened up and access
some of this paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wondered why this paper was a little
smaller than the parchment that I'm used
[SPEAKER_01]: to, but I guess it makes very good sense
in the sense that we're using a much
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So too will we be using much smaller
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think first things first,
because we're not ready to press yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's hit the switch on this little boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bad boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see the screen light up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably come over to the side here a
little bit and turn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please remove force from press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then press OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's remove force from press.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it opens up the same old LED screen
that I'm used to and know and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giving me my force.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got system settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a quick press.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got run recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got last run data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say we go into recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have merely turned the heaters on here
and here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my settings at 220 Fahrenheit,
which for the recipe that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be running is going to work fine for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's go back to this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one edit recipe name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set material type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Restarted it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go select flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Select bag size.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's adding the weight based on bag
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got my pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just go run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have to push start press when
we're actually ready to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be turning this little guy to
check out how well it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very, very cool little unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys do such a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little drip tray for those of
you that didn't know what this was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's loose right now because I was playing
around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm trying to hold the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love the idea of a drip tray,
I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these sides, I've had parchment
absolutely drip down inside the machine on
[SPEAKER_01]: my long peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very nice little unit right
here, this little drip tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in and out very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lift it right out if you don't
want to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a matter of actually opening
up the press a little bit, which happens
[SPEAKER_01]: very easy with a little bit of twisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just pops right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our little tray right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also found out that these particular
guys are obviously clamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they are for is to clamp the unit
down to any table that you're working on
[SPEAKER_01]: if need be, if you're really cranking away
at this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to use the drip tray and put
it down over this way because that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the wiring is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll fit that in nice and carefully.
Pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll wait for these to heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already at 105 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It even came with magnets.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are on the ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got our little catch right here that
you can keep that on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a bit of parchment coming
off the back, which is never a problem for
[SPEAKER_01]: me because I love when I have a real
squisher to be able to have that little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of back room for the oil to escape
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 gram runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously this is a lot smaller than I'm
used to doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm used to doing 35 to 40 gram runs of
flour and even higher of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a real nice little small
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can carry it around with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect I could get this thing to fit
into a Pelican case, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: adventures in rosin making.
[SPEAKER_01]: How fun would it be to take the bubble
bags and the dry sieve screens and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin press up to the ice cave on the
Pemberton ice caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bust out some high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are at 139 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 60 to 80 degrees away from the
temperature that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, there are important
components to making this easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: to making it less difficult than
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about having all of the proper
tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have your bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what do I have for bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some 90 microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some 36 microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some 72 microns and I have some 115
microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So four different size bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these bags I'd use for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: 36 micron I'd use for hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the template for pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our funnels, which I can put the
dirty ones in here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as our flipper unit, which is very
key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got our bags, our parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of getting all this stuff out of
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool the way you can
basically attach these to a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not very difficult to do,
is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to try maybe one while
we're sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Table's not too wide, but definitely wide
enough that it's making a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did we have one other one of those
little dodgers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's actually a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure once you get, you know,
moving on this thing, you could get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little excited depending on who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could start moving the whole unit and
that's not really going to be an ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So material on the screen gets put in
properly and doesn't come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then we end up with a fair bit of
screen contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of the plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to be able to put my finger in there
and not worry about the whole press
[SPEAKER_01]: squishing it and crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let's go start press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stage one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go up to, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're at 729 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 1,100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Force is at 2,800.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Force is at 4,600.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see if we can't turn that
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can start seeing the oil coming out
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see quite a bit of oil coming out
the sides here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's buttering up nicely here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's at some good force.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little close up of what we got going on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at our percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our 8,000 pounds of force.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the drip tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do indeed like the drip tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also see around back here that
it's all still starting to push rosin out
[SPEAKER_01]: through the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like it's wanting to butter
up right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that generally is what happens with
very high THC product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember it was only 12 grams,
so I'm hoping for at least three grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be maybe even a little bit more
for this particular strain cultivar cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stop the press and open this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really only gets a little bit tough at
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's go around and see what we
got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it, Oreo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that seems like there might
be the tiniest little bit left in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to collect that up and I'll
let you guys know what it is in one second
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I have crushed out the first
and second press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did end up getting just over three
grams, which I guess would probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: around 26%, 27%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I left a little bit behind from what I
normally get with my long peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, this is my first press with
this unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really understand exactly how to
set it up, so I'm pretty sure in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: week or two I'll get that 2% back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly not upset with it, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three solid grams of really caramel,
beautiful, where's my bike, flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to say so far the first
experience with the Helix Pro has been
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did also figure out both of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they actually go on is they go between
the wheel and the foot, so they go kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like that underneath, and so that's why
they don't need to be different sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will set it up next time better with
the clamps because once you get it...
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, the first... When you're closing
it and opening it, it opens really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get to around five, 6,000,
7,000, 8,000 pounds per pressure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts getting a little bit harder and
I can see for sure how you could move the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a lot more happening
with this press.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a whole video and
actually using this press with flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift and bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really wanted to do an unboxing
video today and I thought what a great way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do an unboxing video to also show a
really quick press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to the people, the group over
at Pure Pressure, the team, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to seeing you all at Lyft
in January, January 11th to 13th or 14th,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys, Pure Pressure, are coming out
and will have a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably find me at their booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I will be walking around with
my team from Embark.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see me there, definitely pull me
aside and say hello and great,
[SPEAKER_01]: great little unit, super quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once you see this unit in person
and you feel the quality of the tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really get the idea very quickly that
this is a solid unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a lot, Pure Pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everyone for watching and we'll see
you next time on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
