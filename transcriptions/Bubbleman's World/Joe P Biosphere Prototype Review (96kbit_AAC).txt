[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and we are here today at High Integrity
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have this absolutely beautiful piece to
review today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a collaboration between Joe
Peder's Glass and SPGatX on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you check my Instagram, bcbubbleman,
I've got a photo of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you check High Integrity Glass Art's
Instagram, he's got a photo of it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives the links to both the blowers and
mentions that it's a prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosphere perk, I can show you now what
the perk looks like in slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's very violent eruption
from the base as it curls around the back
[SPEAKER_00]: and comes through this giant biosphere
perk and almost like shoots out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: piece rather than in a solid stream like a
recycler usually does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this real sort of cool splash and
it creates a different feel when you pull
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes real nice, High Integrity Glass
Art just ripped it for the first time and
[SPEAKER_00]: had a real nice rip and I'm about to join
him on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess we will torch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, lovely remnants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going in for some strawberry
banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I heated it up a little less than 20
seconds, so we're going to do a 40 second
[SPEAKER_00]: cool down on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's really nice little sort
of a little beehive in the middle here
[SPEAKER_00]: with this really cool disc perk that comes
out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really a violent eruption of bees in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic Joe P. Stoked to hit this,
I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: About eight seconds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I mention I've been not puffing for
the last eight days and this is about my
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth or fifth puff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice preservation on those turps for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting out of the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that perk is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely say it is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of starts out like a recycler,
but it's more open and it has more chug to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as tight of a pull, but really unique
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like how it would preserve those
turps, that nice low temp dab of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good etiquette to clean your
friend's banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shazz the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we say, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was just damn sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real, real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go and do a live Instagram video
right now and show them what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: missing out there because this is
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always props to the glass blowers and high
integrity glass art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I mention this pendant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faceted on the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs sealed and delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try, try, try.
