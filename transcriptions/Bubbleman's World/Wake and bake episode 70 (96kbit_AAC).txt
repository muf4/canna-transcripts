[SPEAKER_01]: question will be asked about today is
called dry sifting in the Snow,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a 20-minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just under 20 minute long video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got almost 40,000 views just under at
39,500 and it's a you know new technique
[SPEAKER_01]: in regards to cleaning out larger
contaminants stigmas and pistol it hairs,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc And also more carding techniques and
cleaning on the single screen to find 95%
[SPEAKER_01]: plus glandular head ratio so if Everyone
is ready and has headed over to the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know The name of the
cultivar that I'm cleaning the sift The
[SPEAKER_01]: name of the cultivar of the sift that I'm
cleaning in the first two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is Dan Richards with the win Can
a tonic good job Dan Richards you my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend have won yourself a bottle of dark
crystal cleaner Yeah, right on brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dan if you wouldn't mind sending me an
email at BC bubble man at iCloud.com I
[SPEAKER_01]: will for certain throw a little gem on

whole unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yours Dan sitting on top of there and
Can a tonic was the correct You know for
[SPEAKER_01]: those of you that don't know much about

may or may not learn something so who's to
[SPEAKER_01]: know I can't promise that you will but I
know there's some good stuff there and Go

[SPEAKER_01]: expectations Josh Warner Ken Hayes Making
my mouth water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well Kaylee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's uh, that's definitely how that
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's gear up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get the right The right carb cap all
right P for duck face All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love this clear brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello there Amelia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're having a good day Yeah,
this is a good time of day Pedro I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going to be heading out today and
getting my boat So we should see some boat
[SPEAKER_01]: videos in the very near future been
anxious to get the boat out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been taking a while All right,
everybody if you're ready,
[SPEAKER_01]: I Have not seen him chilling like a
villain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is he pretty fucked up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't think I mentioned that I'm gonna
go get my boat every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I mentioned it a few time Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I I Could care less chilling like a
villain, you know, he turned out to be not
[SPEAKER_01]: a very nice person
[SPEAKER_01]: I Tried to be his friend for some time and
he just kind of turned into someone that I
[SPEAKER_01]: should have known when Remo was having
problems with him that something was wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: because Remo is basically the nicest
fucking dude His whole family are so nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and once they started having problems with
mark the weed guy And stopped filming with
[SPEAKER_01]: him is not too too long after I sort of
made the same decision that Maybe my life
[SPEAKER_01]: was gonna be better without him in it
Whereas Remo's an awesome person and my
[SPEAKER_01]: life would be worse without him in it So
I'm happy that he's in my life him and
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandra are very very kind people Yes,
cleaning the chairs no chairs here all
[SPEAKER_01]: chairs free All right, so yeah dry sifting
a little bit of dry sifting knowledge for
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys today I sell a four screen kit
and it's really two different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sell the 110 micron, which is about 160
sorry the 110 lines per inch which is
[SPEAKER_01]: about 160 micron and then that comes with
a 200 line inch which is about 70 micron
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course everyone knows the basics of
that method which is gently sift over top
[SPEAKER_01]: of your 110 collect your farmers grade
sift break it up nicely almost like you
[SPEAKER_01]: would with flour sifting it over the
screen and Getting it ready for carding or
[SPEAKER_01]: some DVD static, which is also carding And
you can do your separation on those two
[SPEAKER_01]: screens like that then we also sell the 60
and the 90 mesh which is 250 microns and
[SPEAKER_01]: 180 and this is a simple trick that a guy
was showing on IC mag for a while where
[SPEAKER_01]: you separate the screens by about an inch
They're very large screens larger holes
[SPEAKER_01]: than I would ever dry sift with normally
But the trick is when you just throw
[SPEAKER_01]: things down on it gently the way the
residue Doesn't heads fall they fall solid
[SPEAKER_01]: and the way everything else falls it kind
of does this You get a lot of this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant sticking into the screen like
a little tree or a blade of grass And you
[SPEAKER_01]: can clean up some some decent sift with
this little trick Obviously the static
[SPEAKER_01]: parchment method is going to clean up much
quicker much faster But it's nice to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the option Sometimes you want to just
throw something down lift up the screens
[SPEAKER_01]: and have what you're ready to smoke other
times you want to put a real time and
[SPEAKER_01]: investment in and make it Actually Scott
he was told the method But yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy who is popularized this method is
a huge douche and I won't even mention his
[SPEAKER_01]: name because of it The crazy taste
difference between the titanium and
[SPEAKER_01]: quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's definitely a difference,
you know it's the way the heat is relieved
[SPEAKER_01]: the way the Surface area holds heat and
releases heat Thank You Scott much love
[SPEAKER_01]: for that Hard to get in UK your shop in
London is sold ASAP bubble man hard to get
[SPEAKER_01]: in UK your shop in London is I'm not sure
what you're talking about whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble bags Ah Follow your follow your
passion man Will heads fall through the 90
[SPEAKER_01]: micron?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well Some will ones that are smaller than
90 micron, but the ones that are left on
[SPEAKER_01]: top are gonna be the ones that I want some
of the ones that Fall underneath like the
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 I catch the 70 and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That's what I like to hear well water,
I mean honestly, it's really a good
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about it Yes,
my D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nail quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sapphire dish is also tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been also enjoying my dark crystal
quartz tastes really nice I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blessed with a whole variety of
cannabis terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got You know at least ten
different ones here just on the desk from
[SPEAKER_01]: Karma's Bitch to Swiss tsunami to Kovelis
our diesel Yeah, pretty happy with all
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm pretty happy with all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking on an original cut of orange
skunk extract Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good goods bubble man smaller heads equals
no medicine not necessarily MR melt You
[SPEAKER_01]: know often the heads for whatever reason
that I've seen grown in some really
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely warm tropical spots like
Australia Tends to produce a really
[SPEAKER_01]: lovingly high grade high quality lower
micron head Like 25 micron full melt super
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful Reminiscent of what 73 or 90
looks like so I do like I do like the DC
[SPEAKER_01]: banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would absolutely recommend DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's great He's got a good good
little company's real friendly Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, and he's got good customer service.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Those are important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's one thing to purchase
something I want it to be a good product
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want to be able to get in touch
with the people I purchased it from if I
[SPEAKER_01]: require High integrity dish nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not yet used the high integrity or
Dish nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get more return from rosin if make
the pucks first?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the terpene profile like on the
notorious Aussie strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know the terpene profile,
but it was very unique and wonderful And
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I think that you're gonna be more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends Here's the thing with
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's there's a multitude of ways to
get your yield out For me, the key is to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the yield out without sacrificing the
quality So most people sacrifice the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality by pressing and pressing and
pressing or heating it up for at higher
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures Just because they want that
last little five or ten percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Could do without that five or ten
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather keep the stuff a nice beautiful
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a nice color or Almost no color at
all That's you know compared to this like
[SPEAKER_01]: dark sappy Just I'm not as inspired by
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say I wasn't impressed with this
particular one, but Yeah, I love your
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble box you're going to come out with a
bigger bubble box now Pedro I've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: screens a bigger bubble box would be like
a thousand bucks like it would got so
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive the bubble box doubled in price
over I mean my Costs doubled in price the
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble box itself went up about 30 bucks
that year, but All my costs went up double
[SPEAKER_01]: so we lost we lost A fair chunk of our
marketplace profit mark marketplace in
[SPEAKER_01]: that and it's just gone worse and worse
and worse as the years go by so very few
[SPEAKER_01]: people would ever purchase a larger bubble
box just because of the investment of
[SPEAKER_01]: money that it would require Are you
dabbing distiller was that just some
[SPEAKER_01]: really fire rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin rosin and more rosin and then a
little bit of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still got like a tiny little I've been
using this JTK jar as a Well, it works
[SPEAKER_01]: better on my sapphire But yeah,
it fits right over top of my sapphire as a
[SPEAKER_01]: carb and then the the bubble hash inside
of it heats up slowly and melts down It's
[SPEAKER_01]: it gives you ninja dabs all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, Kane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have definitely run some sleet stack
beautiful cultivar as well as the sleet
[SPEAKER_01]: stack crossed with skunk number one I
Believe they do survivor one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe they do I think that we will
learn in the near future with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that Certain terpene expressions are going
to be What we would consider better when
[SPEAKER_01]: grown properly with probiotics and you
know proper nutrients proper organics
[SPEAKER_01]: proper living soils You know beneficial
microbials and just being allowed to put
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant in a situation Where it can
express itself to absolute perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what we're all going for as
growers Although I will admit that
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition really Hit us to a hard left
ball a curve ball in a sense Whereas all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden it seemed like a lot of people
were actually just growing for profit and
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't really care as much about the
quality and the end results because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: really about it ends to a Means for them
which was and I'm not dissing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I get it cannabis is a wide
ranging Plant that can help you pay your
[SPEAKER_01]: mortgage if you like But I think that it
was prohibition of cannabis that was
[SPEAKER_01]: helping people pay their mortgages more
than cannabis itself But I like the future
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're moving into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope prohibition falls to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Monica.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like someone that's gonna have
to go Sorry, I know it's coming Grow for
[SPEAKER_01]: health that's it drew Robertson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried hardcore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gee if you have what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, oh geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh geez are great In a sense that they you
know as a hardcore smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love their strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the headspace The flavor for me is
is less incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a nice kush But whoops,
let me get rid of her real quick,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I prefer exotics I prefer things like
the Congolese and things like lemon Thai
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Cambodian from Doc Atomic and
Jesus Christ How many of these bots am I
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have to boot the boob bots are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind Dedicating some time to the
boob bots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean if I gotta like
Really just focus for a few seconds on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bot boobies or the booby bots,
you know I will take care of business
[SPEAKER_01]: because let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not here to talk about boobs I'm
sure there's a lot of other channels that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are talking about boobs But we're
here talking about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system talking about terpenes and
cannabinoids and yes, I agree Fuck those
[SPEAKER_01]: bots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Connor Jay just donated two dollars to
Terpdip bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find a good place for that to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Shona Banda Maybe forest and the
Caladrius network.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't keep any money that is donated to
me through YouTube Just know that the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 650 to 700 that was donated through the
Don't add as a moderator that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: real fucked up Imagine if I accidentally
made one of the boob bots a moderator or
[SPEAKER_01]: an admin Abby scary Anyway, those boob
bots really didn't kind of take over the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations didn't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get back to what we were talking
about dry sifting So for those of you that
[SPEAKER_01]: want to jump into the game and get
yourself involved the dry sift screens are
[SPEAKER_01]: available over at fresh headies calm as
well as bubble bag calm so you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: check that out and We've got a ton of
bubble bags in right now So I think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably gonna have a little sale some
type of a 10 or 20% discount thing going
[SPEAKER_01]: on you would absolutely Love the sleet
stunt sleet stack skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are killer BG They absolutely
are I suspect for women as well as men so
[SPEAKER_01]: there is that foot or hand pump with the
Sasquatch both Never ever limit yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: always go with both That's the way it is
there is no choice in this day and age the
[SPEAKER_01]: choice is everything You know,
you just don't want to not you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to cut yourself off thinking this is the
best way and when really the best a Very
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome way as well could be right over
here behind you that you're ignoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, trust me Nobody's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble bandhammer is on high alert No
boob bots are going to be getting past my
[SPEAKER_01]: bandhammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, I Wouldn't even want to
be one of those boob bots right now
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm telling you the hammers coming
down hard On those boob bots and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: meantime, you know, we're here at the wake
and bake episode 70 And we are feeding our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just two thumbs up for two tears
down That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take no shit Exactly any idea what
flavors you'll be growing this round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me just block Ava Willis Willis
and get back to you Well, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to reefer man and he's been
offering me some very very lovely things
[SPEAKER_01]: And if some of those things come through I
will announce it and I will mention it
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to figure out our
greenhouse, you know forever flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: they inspired me I really loved having
them on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I contacted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked them what kind of deal we could
get I guess they didn't really reply back
[SPEAKER_01]: with a deal as much as well Let us know
what kind of deals you find and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: match it or something like that So I've
been in touch with a few greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been offered cost so far We'd be
super killer if in the future we could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually be given potentially one the
amount Of advertising that we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what happens Let me just boo
bot these bitches out of here real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom and a wham bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a three quick boobop bam and we're
back to talking about the greenhouse So
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, some greenhouse companies are
basically having interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at potentially offering us
Some pretty awesome deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on pharmacy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're gonna we're gonna figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to work with forever flowers
Flowering but at the same time I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: probably gonna have to work with whoever
offers us the the best quality greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: for the best price Because it's going to
be like a commercial for this greenhouse I
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee you you guys when you see this
video is gonna be on point these videos
[SPEAKER_01]: with Ron my mentor Every day getting to do
wake and bakes with them getting to do
[SPEAKER_01]: tips with Ron Oh Betty Olson, you know
what's gonna happen to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you what's gonna happen to you
it's gonna be a click and a clack and a
[SPEAKER_01]: schwack and You my friend with your
boobies Right out of the room pretty sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: that we picked up all these boob bots
though for real like holy smokes How did
[SPEAKER_01]: how did we get so popular with the boob
bots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't have that popular of a
channel going on here Betty Boop I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: watching before hash church was a ting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's legit right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my ban hammer is glowing,
bro I borrowed it from Thor actually I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: using Thor's hammer to ban people and let
me just Tell you you're not gonna sneak by
[SPEAKER_01]: me Sophie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to All these dirty
milkers boosted be man self-esteem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you greenhouse grow during Canadian
winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely here, especially here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a big old bot a bot kick coming
on We're gonna be booting Ava.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be booting Monica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be booting Chelsea Oh,
yeah, that felt good on the old ban hammer
[SPEAKER_01]: that felt good So I think I've booted
about 15 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't worry squeak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a few seconds when it finally
kicks in but Yesterday was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they might they're trying to that's
for sure pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it Hillary's got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably some program that the more
you delete the more they show up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but whatever I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty quick Plus I'm having a kind of
a fun time, you know right now this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Dude lion grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way I have a hater out there
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like 25,000 are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just I have I give no fucks and I
can't hold my tongue So, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's always gonna get you into a little
bit of trouble Ava Pittman wash whack
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, man, he greenhouse brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I'm not doing greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't don't know much about Greenhouses
myself, but I'm going to be very fortunate
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn with all of you and have Ron my
old mentor Running the grow and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna be fun probably gonna whack You
know fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe for the first time who knows with
some Congolese, but we'll see what reefer
[SPEAKER_01]: man saying maybe something else How do I
feel about freeze-dried dry sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's unnecessary but to each
their own, you know, if people want to run
[SPEAKER_01]: their shit through a vac I support it But
remember the only thing you're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is you're going to be affecting Nothing
other than the texture of the hash The
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the hash is never going to be
changed and I try to teach this to the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: people for the longest time The quality of
your oil doesn't change when you make it
[SPEAKER_01]: honeycomb or pull and snap or butter These
are all marketing methods to sell a
[SPEAKER_01]: product But it doesn't have anything to do
with the quality and that how that product
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to affect you So when bubble
hashes no different whether you press it
[SPEAKER_01]: or leave it unpressed and I know Frenchy
cannoli claims that when he presses his
[SPEAKER_01]: hash it's creating more terpenes,
but I Just don't I don't see the science
[SPEAKER_01]: agreeing with that personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have to agree to disagree with him
on that I Like 12 to 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a typical Congolese would go for
I'm not sure what knowledge on phytol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no knowledge on phytol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're talking about
true Don't buy into the hype By the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's awesome that you're working with
forever flowering have wanted since the
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier Well, I hope to be working with
forever flowering to be honest I mean if
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have just written me back and
said we'll hook you up with cost or some
[SPEAKER_01]: even beyond cost because these things are
like 50 plus thousand dollars for these
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses with the full and I want to be
able to show it in all of its glory I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not looking for a handout But I don't want
to spend retail on something that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to literally put you know serious
serious value into promoting in a sense
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know We'll promote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, we're not gonna promote like
we're not getting paid to do the review I
[SPEAKER_01]: just think it's a great idea for the
channel Oh, Francesca Pittman,
[SPEAKER_01]: you must be looking to be blocked from my
channel forever Yeah, I mean pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know some might see it as an
opportunity some might not so I respect
[SPEAKER_01]: that because sometimes people offer me
opportunities and I don't see it and that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean that the Opportunity is not
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can understand if they Don't see the
value, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's like it's a YouTube channel whatever
but what we could grow it into and what it
[SPEAKER_01]: could become Could be something very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie Just having Ron out here
is a huge bonus for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like a father figure and a mentor and
a best friend and A grandfather figure to
[SPEAKER_01]: my kids So I'm very much looking forward
to getting Ron out here getting this
[SPEAKER_01]: project off the ground and I guess the
little bit More that I talk about it the
[SPEAKER_01]: more it'll become a reality I'm gonna try
and work out the greenhouse in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks Like I said, we have been
offered some pretty good deals from a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to make sure that Yeah,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go big squirrel nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Bill Hicks quote on top of some
Liberty cap mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are of course the semolina the
Seattle's Also known as Liberty caps quite
[SPEAKER_01]: popular along the west coast and probably
many other places around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they grow In like Peru and Central
America as well a very small mushroom that
[SPEAKER_01]: that almost dissipates to nothing when
dried But wow, how psychedelic and of
[SPEAKER_01]: course Bill Hicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a ride If you don't know who
Bill Hicks is I really do implore you to
[SPEAKER_01]: go do a little googling a little YouTubing
and go listen to some Bill Hicks because
[SPEAKER_01]: man, I'm telling you the guy He was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's and he was he was crass and he was on
the edge and You know it kept his career
[SPEAKER_01]: stunted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept him from getting on to shows like
The Tonight Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think David Letterman had him on maybe
one time which makes sense because David
[SPEAKER_01]: Letterman's a wild man But most networks
would have nothing to do with Bill Hicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was much more than a comedian But he
was truly a comedian as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you think Make you think make you
think that's so when I think of these
[SPEAKER_01]: semolina and Seattle mushrooms,
which also promote this notion Of language
[SPEAKER_01]: within one's being the logos as Terrence
called it which really creates dialogue
[SPEAKER_01]: and which really makes you think It's a
beautiful shirt to put the two together
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Hicks one of his quotes with the
semolina and Seattle Liberty cap
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah Yes, well, I mean Dave probably has
apologized for being a dick more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: few times in his life, but that's okay
Hope you have doing things in front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera helped out with your cleanliness
have doing so much Things in front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera helped out with your cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure what that means Linus my
cleanliness as in like my personal hygiene
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever tried to drag cannabis under
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have Bill Hicks resonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey man, DK is in is in channel DK Denmark
a bubble man Robert Landry awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for showing up Whatever,
whatever you were very clean shaven when
[SPEAKER_01]: you came home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was Oh with my stash, I don't know
I mean I my stash is You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an actor I just come on here and
do these live videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I film videos when I film generally I'm a
little bit like a director I'll set up my
[SPEAKER_01]: shot and I'll make sure that certain
things aren't in it Mainly because when I
[SPEAKER_01]: first got onto YouTube, I had no idea how
savage people were I had no idea how Quick
[SPEAKER_01]: people were to want to hijack the purpose
Of the conversation or the dialogue that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was trying to start and it's just human
nature It is what it is But there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: someone that wants to direct something
over to here and over to there the classic
[SPEAKER_01]: of course being my Puffing the hash joint
where I must have gotten literally a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand people asked me why I had toilet
paper On my desk, which was like well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would clean my dabber with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I blow my nose with it I
never thought what people were writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like oh, this is bubble man's
a sick pervert it Was well now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you why I care Amelia mainly
because they hijacked the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden that becomes the
conversation So I've learned to film
[SPEAKER_01]: videos where I clean things up a little
bit, but for the most part I'm not you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, my I don't I'm not setting up too
much when I do these little videos So and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been a while since I've even done an
actual video I haven't pulled my video
[SPEAKER_01]: camera out and what seems like almost a
month and Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for smoking pot But just having
an honest conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this what people are doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what people do with toilet paper
next to their computer desks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm living in a different world Do
I condone hemp seeds in your food?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do I condone hemp seeds in your
food?
[SPEAKER_01]: I I I suggest it and not necessarily just
hemp seeds It can be the essential amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acid rich oils that are inside those seed
embryos that have been squeezed or the D
[SPEAKER_01]: hauled seed or whatever, of course Well
big chew You know what you edit because
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, for example, I'll give you a
wonderful example Why edit you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: like this when I first started filming
with Johnny B I found that people were
[SPEAKER_01]: really mean and that they would say mean
things about my friend particularly if I
[SPEAKER_01]: left particular things in the edit so I
learned with Johnny B that there were
[SPEAKER_01]: things I needed to edit out or people
would jump down his throat and really
[SPEAKER_01]: attack him and be mean and I just thought
that's That's not what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted I want to show people what a
great Friend my buddy is and what a great
[SPEAKER_01]: person he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to show him in the greatest
light So, of course, I'm gonna remove
[SPEAKER_01]: little errors or mistakes or slip ups that
he says and does and so, you know For
[SPEAKER_01]: example my friend Lincoln we did the pit
We did the video the other day where I
[SPEAKER_01]: gave it away where Lincoln basically
sticks his ass crack in front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera I Forgot to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, because I forgot to edit it out Many
many many bad people said bad things about
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I wasn't quick enough to see it to
delete It that my friend went and saw it
[SPEAKER_01]: and was like, oh people are taught,
you know He laughed and he said ha ha ha
[SPEAKER_01]: ha but I could tell he was a little bit
hurt And so, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to make videos and share
and educate and create dialogue with
[SPEAKER_01]: people so that people can come be mean and
fucking cancerous and savage So yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the haters are the haters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be no, I don't print these
shirts I bought this shirt hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: pure hemp from spannabes last year
vampires exactly so this is why I do
[SPEAKER_01]: Slight editing and why I try to protect my
friends at least What's my opinion on THCO
[SPEAKER_01]: acetate I don't have much of an opinion on
that to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would John be do to cause people to
hate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what people just hate dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just explained it perfectly I
think you can fill in the blanks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all I'm saying is those are the
reasons why I do a little bit of editing
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it as real as real can keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I do love the Dave Chappelle
video Another great skit if you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen that when keeping it real
goes bad That is one reason right there to
[SPEAKER_01]: not maybe keep it real Too bad for Letitia
that these girls kept it realer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to check it out I'm telling you
it's funny shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just block Francesca out of the
room right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right When keeping it real goes wrong
haters gonna hate little did she know
[SPEAKER_01]: little did Letitia know her husband was a
federal agent Let's have one more rip and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll call it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shits and giggles, but Let's do
this Can I please send you some seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you can get your own seeds dude in

pancake Smoking a pancake never a problem

[SPEAKER_01]: time you have to know that You can buy

[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be old pancakes and even then
you're right.

I prefer glass and mothership,
[SPEAKER_01]: but whatever pan Holken house Maybe we'll
