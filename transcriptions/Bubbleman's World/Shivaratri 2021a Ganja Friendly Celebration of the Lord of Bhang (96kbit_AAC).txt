[SPEAKER_02]: use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mark Richardson and Kelly Golov,
they can also attest to this in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we've done is we've,
I've adapted a very simple ritual from the
[SPEAKER_02]: 19th century by this guy Chandra Ananda
Kali.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, in 1867, came up with a
three-chillum ritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dedicated to the three-faced Shiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a three-faced Shiva right here,
smoking a chillum, drinking this holy
[SPEAKER_02]: bong, and preparing bong right here,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would have been used, they would
have been used in chillums much like this
[SPEAKER_02]: antique chillum from India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Ananda Chandra Kali's view was,
is he wanted to come up with a form of
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva worship that included all the
different castes of India so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't separated through these racial
divisions, you know, the color of their
[SPEAKER_02]: skin and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he came up with the three-chillum
for the three-faced Shiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the three-faced Shiva in his time was
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, which were the
[SPEAKER_02]: three main deities, which kind of broke up
the caste system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the three-faced Shiva, he goes way
back in history.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes way back to the Kushan period
when the Scythians were dominating
[SPEAKER_02]: northern India.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three-faced Shiva was worshiped as
well then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very, very old god and very
cannabis connected as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're going to do first is I'm
going to invite everybody to like load a
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe or a chillum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the beauty of the three-chillum
ritual is the simplicity of the ritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the basis of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that didn't take a lot of
preparation, something that everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: could partake of in together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what we're going for
here, something very simple and basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have a kind of an
overview of Shiva in between the
[SPEAKER_02]: three-chillums.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got different speakers coming up
throughout the next couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to do a simple bong
pouring on the lingam ritual as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: partway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's start it all off by loading
up a chillum or a pipe or a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use whatever you want,
but the idea is the three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to let Marcus Gary
Richardson, hey, why don't you pipe in?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've been to India and you've
been to the big celebration of the Kumbha
[SPEAKER_02]: Mela, which is like the huge, huge
celebration in the world, longest
[SPEAKER_02]: continual celebration, I believe,
as well as probably the largest human
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've partaken of the holy ganja with
Sadhus, worshippers of Shiva right there
[SPEAKER_02]: in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, what an amazing experience it
was to be able to to be able to have that
[SPEAKER_03]: experience in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of remember, you know,
I think it was the year that Trey,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I was really into fish and I was
traveling and cruising around and checking
[SPEAKER_03]: out fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of missed the Grateful Dead scene
just by a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry passed away in 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up on this fish road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And around 1998, the guitarist from Fish
was like, you know what, guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I love that you're here every night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in so many words, he basically said,
go do something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, honestly, stop following us around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go do something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to do something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what would be a cool,
like, thing for me to go like travel,
[SPEAKER_03]: like for tour, like I'm going to see fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a multi thousand year old
ancient ritual, you know, taken place by
[SPEAKER_03]: millions and millions of people over the
course of our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly even over the course of just
my visit, there was over three million
[SPEAKER_03]: people in the town that I went to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did go to the Kumbh Mela.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough to go for those of you
that know a little bit about the Kumbh
[SPEAKER_03]: Mela.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a festival that happens every three
years in four different holy cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe it's Jaipur, Alabad,
Varnasi and Haridwar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have gotten that wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I ended up in Haridwar where it re
does every 12 years, you end up for what
[SPEAKER_03]: is called the Maha Maha Kumbh Mela.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they also have a Maha Maha Maha Kumbh
Mela, which is the 144 year cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you get into a rituals like this
with a group of people that have had
[SPEAKER_03]: history like this, I mean, for me,
it was the most incredible thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to compare it to fish and the Grateful
Dead Lot was very cool because when I got
[SPEAKER_03]: there and I was overwhelmed by all of
these incredible people, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we started, you know, we started,
oh, let's go smoke some charas with these
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were smoking with all of these
different sects, the Brahmas and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Bishnu's and the eventually the Shivites.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before I met the Shivites,
I met the Nagas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was probably some of my most
intense experience because that was there
[SPEAKER_03]: was some massive cultural differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't even think people like not
everyone in India hangs out with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Nagas, you know, because there's even
cultural differences in that culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, I found that it was just they
were just really the most out there from
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that I understood or knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really thrived on hanging out with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was archaic hanging out with a
bunch of kind of nude dudes that were,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that they knew we didn't speak
their language.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were kind of grunting and using
body languages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were just in these little almost
like cave like huts and they've got their
[SPEAKER_03]: bodies covered in ashes and they don't own
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're smoking this Nepali charas that,
you know, me and my buddy brought to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Kumbha Mela.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember leaving there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember leaving the Naga tent,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a Hare Krishna who was
outside and he was quite educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he looked I could tell he'd
been to like university, but he was also
[SPEAKER_03]: very, you know, he was following his
spiritual path.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was really kind of offended by what
he said, because he said, oh, what were
[SPEAKER_03]: you doing in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, oh, we were just, you know,
meeting and interacting and sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, did you eat any food?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: They offered us some food and we ate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you will surely be poisoned,
he says to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, I was like,
oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even here at the Kumbha Mela,
there's this same petty energy that you
[SPEAKER_03]: find on fish tour, you know, like this is,
this is something we're just recreating
[SPEAKER_03]: these rituals in our own rights through,
because we lack the culture in North
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we recreate these gatherings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really found my people when I met
Pashupati, the Shivaite Baba that I
[SPEAKER_03]: connected with in Haridwar, the one that I
continue to smoke with every day on the
[SPEAKER_03]: banks of the Ganges.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more chillen we are making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Babaji, one more chillen we are
making.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, did we smoke incredible hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: He found us like you, Chris, would find
the dank on dead tour, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: amongst three million people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on a side note, this guy spoke over 50
languages.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would pull people off the Ganges.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd just be like, that guy there,
go get him, go get him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he would just speak their
language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't matter where they were from,
North Korea, South Korea, Thailand,
[SPEAKER_03]: China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just spoke like I didn't even know that
one person could know that many languages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, his story was that he
was caught stealing as a young boy,
[SPEAKER_03]: nine years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a choice to go to prison or to
become the helper of the Babas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he started helping Babas and
traveling with Babas.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was from Rajasthan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he ended up meeting some really
colored, colorful character Shivaite
[SPEAKER_03]: Babas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they took him under their wing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would create the clay cups in the
morning so that they were all ready for
[SPEAKER_03]: the chai throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would keep the fire stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would sweep the area on the banks
of the river.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so doing that for many years,
that's how he got onto the spiritual path
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Shivaite Baba and just really
connected with the Shivaites while I was
[SPEAKER_03]: in Haridwar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never snubbed my nose at hanging out
with anyone because I was so interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: learning from all these different
cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it took me two days to realize who my
people were at the Mahakumbha Mela.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the motorcycle Baba too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was known as as well,
wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a different Baba.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Shivajiri.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mark Rose can speak of Shivajiri
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was Doc Atomic who actually
introduced Mark Rose to Shivajiri.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure he has incredible stories
because that was a heavy Baba that he was
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he hung out with him for a lot more
than a month here and a month there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was he was invited into caves that like
no white person has been invited into
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like for sure, at least for a
thousand or two thousand years,
[SPEAKER_03]: caves that cows were allowed in,
but just not foreigners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I hope he tells those stories
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wish I'd invited Dr. Atomic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually now that you mentioned it,
I should have.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had taken when my son was born,
he'd taken a picture to Shivajiri and had
[SPEAKER_02]: a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave me the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, dude, I set that all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, man, like, let's get a picture
of I actually asked Mark Rose to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, oh, I'm too afraid to ask
Shivajiri.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I asked Dr. Atomic and he was kind
of like, oh, man, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, dude, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, of course, like this guy's full of
love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just tell him the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, two days later,
there's Shivajiri in the cave holding the
[SPEAKER_03]: picture of your son.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so incredible, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his son is called Shiva too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shiva.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, I went out of my way to make
that one happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so did Dr. Atomic and so did Mark
Rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were both just afraid to ask him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, well, come on, I get it
that you revere and look up to this man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, listen, if he's emanating
the love that you're saying he's
[SPEAKER_03]: emanating, then it's not going to be a
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to say, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Rose was surprised when he just said,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, give me the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these these guys, they're basically
street people a lot of times, but then
[SPEAKER_02]: they're great figures of respect in India
as well, you know, and with full of full
[SPEAKER_02]: of mojo as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a real dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was really hard for the British
to understand when they first went in to
[SPEAKER_02]: India that these naked beggars were
commanding the respect of the townspeople
[SPEAKER_02]: more so than they could with their weapons
and horses and chariots and all that type
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They must have missed those chapters in
the Bible that said Jesus doesn't come
[SPEAKER_03]: back as a CEO of the fortune 500 company.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's generally going to be barefoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's might look like a beggar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you see in Trump is that the new
Messiah?
[SPEAKER_03]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first speaker we got is here,
Caligula Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to give us, you know,
if you don't know about Shiva now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because our brother here is
going to be giving us a good spiel on the
[SPEAKER_02]: background of Shiva in Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very grateful to be invited to talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to say what I'm about to say,
but I want to say it because I have a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of gratitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so traditionally we think our gurus,
but because I normally break with
[SPEAKER_07]: tradition, I'm going to do it anyway,
because out of gratitude.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the first person I want to thank is
Chris, because growing up, Chris was a
[SPEAKER_07]: major figure for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I grew up in Christianity and I broke
away from Christianity.
[SPEAKER_07]: My heart was broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a major reunification with my theology
with Christianity was Chris's work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris kind of like gave me back the
romance that I lost with Christianity
[SPEAKER_07]: because he made me realize that this plant
and what Christ was saying and the Jewish
[SPEAKER_07]: mysteries were this continuous message
from ancient times that I eventually
[SPEAKER_07]: connected to Kashmir because in Kashmir we
have a mixing of the Jewish mysteries and
[SPEAKER_07]: the Shavite mysteries.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was there where I found this big
melting pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was ancient, ancient times where you
could see the Jews and the Shavites
[SPEAKER_07]: sharing Kabbalah and Shavism side by side,
mixing their theology.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the modern Kabbalah and the modern
Shavism that we have today came from that
[SPEAKER_07]: mixing, came from that, that intermixing
of ideas from Shavism.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything Chris has been doing from
the start has been leading up to this in
[SPEAKER_07]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been like a confluence of rivers,
just like the Yamuna, the Saraswati and
[SPEAKER_07]: the Ganges meet at this triple point.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the main figures that connects all
of our traditions is it's called
[SPEAKER_07]: Triumvakanatha, which is Dionysus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dionysus is known as Triambos,
the thrice great one, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: The winning one, the triumphant one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Triumvakanatha connects us to that
river.
[SPEAKER_07]: Triumvakanatha is also the God who is
married to the triple rivers, the three
[SPEAKER_07]: over and over again, the triples,
the triple rovers, the triple powers,
[SPEAKER_07]: the triple prongs, the triple goddesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's also the God who is married to the
triple goddesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the special meaning of Triumvakanatha
also is not only three eyes, it's three
[SPEAKER_07]: rivers and three wives.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's three meanings in one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This idea that three meanings exist in one
repeats itself over and over again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even in like a Jewish text where you're
supposed to interpret it, there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: threefold meaning in one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the same way, these Shavite texts is
three meanings in one.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the Shambhal interpretation,
there's the Shaky interpretation,
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's the individual interpretation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're dealing with the highest level in
Kashmir, with the monistic, with the first
[SPEAKER_07]: one, Shambho, with Shiva himself,
where we identify directly and simply with
[SPEAKER_07]: Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we talk about simplicity and
bringing back simplicity, this particular
[SPEAKER_07]: time right now, Shivaratri is the union of
the future and of the past together,
[SPEAKER_07]: where the sun and the moon come together,
where the in and out breath come together,
[SPEAKER_07]: where we realize now at this moment that
everything's opening up and we get that
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding of the true potential of the
future, where it was the same potential
[SPEAKER_07]: that came from the past, that Shiva is
that consciousness of potentiality that
[SPEAKER_07]: has infinite evolution, infinite
potentiality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's this moment now we're experiencing
a radical revolution of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_07]: This psychedelic research has been like at
the forefront of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why I thank you and I consider you
part of that lineage of gurus.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you just as much as somebody that I
honor as I do Swamiji.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the same way, Swami Lakshman Juh,
he opened up the tradition.
[SPEAKER_07]: In this age, he opened up tradition.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everybody gets initiation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody can open up these texts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody can listen to what we're saying
and be initiated right now that everything
[SPEAKER_07]: has changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The future is open to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of us are going to become Shiva if we
want to, if we so desire it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the eighteenth, in ninth century,
he was one of the masters of Utpala Deva.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is the master of the master of the
master.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's one of the starting masters of this
tradition.
[SPEAKER_07]: He opened this tradition up to everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, no, doesn't matter who you are,
women, all castes, all creeds,
[SPEAKER_07]: all race, anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can understand these words,
that's how simple it can be.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be as simple as understanding
because it is as simple as recognition.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the school of recognition.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the highest and easiest path.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we say easy, we laugh because
it's like it's deceptively easy because it
[SPEAKER_07]: requires a level of mental fortitude that
can only be facilitated by something like
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So back again, cannabis is important
because cannabis facilitates the
[SPEAKER_07]: forgetting of the world and the focusing
on consciousness, on meditation,
[SPEAKER_07]: on the higher elevation of the mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cannabis once again brings us into the
moment, into the focus, into the one
[SPEAKER_07]: pointed awareness.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when Swamiji taught me how to pray,
he was quoting the Gita, he was quoting a
[SPEAKER_07]: Vaishnava text, but he was like,
it doesn't matter if it's a Vaishnava
[SPEAKER_07]: text.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will use the Vaishnava text and we'll
say, you know, it's a chapter three of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Gita, verse 14, where he talks about rain,
food, sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the beginning, God created the world
through sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_07]: We sacrifice to the Lord.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Lord rains blessings onto us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whenever we light up, that same fire
is the same fire of sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That fire in the joint is the yagna.
[SPEAKER_07]: That same agony is the same agony in the
Vedic fire rituals.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're performing the Vedic fire rituals
when we light up and we say to ourselves,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fire is Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: I offer Shiva to Shiva who is Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lord Shiva is consuming Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't have to say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could just recognize it as you're
smoking your joint, as you're inhaling and
[SPEAKER_07]: exhaling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of these movements, it represents
that constant throbbing, that constant
[SPEAKER_07]: awareness that Shiva is in everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that direct recognition is what I keep
trying to bring up with this school.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's saying, with Palladeva says,
the direct constant recognition of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Lord is the highest form of devotion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing else is necessary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just constantly remember that Lord Shiva
is shining in everything all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that becomes like this constant
understanding that you do in everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our yoga is focused on going outside
and working, helping the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: This missing piece of Kashmir,
of Christ, cannabis, the Jewish mystery is
[SPEAKER_07]: like, this is a continuation of our
heritage, my heritage, what I was raised
[SPEAKER_07]: in, what I've been researching,
what you've been researching.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a continuation of the dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I feel is the resolution of the
dichotomy of this world in which most of
[SPEAKER_07]: the world keeps fighting this fight where
it seems like it's the scholars versus the
[SPEAKER_07]: warriors.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in ancient times, they were friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it seems like we've degenerated
into this fight between the Jewish
[SPEAKER_07]: mysteries and the Aryan mysteries.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what if they were one and the same at
one point, if they just all degenerated
[SPEAKER_07]: into this stupid fight?
[SPEAKER_07]: This ignorance of the Kali Yuga has made
us forget that the scholars existed to
[SPEAKER_07]: facilitate the warriors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have to come together and
realize that we're brothers and sharing
[SPEAKER_07]: that unity, understand that we're
specialized in different ways,
[SPEAKER_07]: but not restricted from the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I'm not trying to push cast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying that we have to realize
that the Vedas talk about how,
[SPEAKER_07]: well, what's good for you isn't good for
me because I was built to do this and you
[SPEAKER_07]: were built to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we shouldn't criticize each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in the mode of this,
like you were talking about the Nagas,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nagas are a completely different
mentality, different way of thinking,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the Kashmir Shaivism comes from
Nagas.
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes from thinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Swami Lakshmanju, he doesn't identify with
Rama.
[SPEAKER_07]: He identifies with Lakshman.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lakshman is considered a Naga.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's considered the reincarnation of
Patanjali who was a Naga.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's considered the incarnation of Seshha
Naga.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's considered the direct incarnation of
the Kamasguna.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this whole Naga teaching is very dark.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very sinister.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's primal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was here before humans was here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was here when the reptiles were here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is an extension of this primordial.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why in the myths, we always see
the Naga and the human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Krishna and his brother, Balarama.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rama and his Lakshman.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always the human teaching and the
Naga teaching.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so here we are realized that Shiva is
friends with the Nagas, friends with the
[SPEAKER_07]: Naga teachings.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why Shiva is Bolanath because he'll
be friends with anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be friends with the Nagas,
with the ghosts, with the demons.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's easy to please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody can come offer anything to Shiva
and he will give them boons.
[SPEAKER_07]: He will accept it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we can come with not only
cannabis, but any herb, any plant that we
[SPEAKER_07]: offer with love to Lord Shiva is a means
and an access to Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I love the word entheogen
because truly it is that Theos,
[SPEAKER_07]: that Shiva that we're trying to generate,
whether we do it through yoga or whether
[SPEAKER_07]: we do it through a preparation or an
elixir, a plant, whether we do it through
[SPEAKER_07]: mantra or japa or Kundalini awakening,
like all our means to achieve Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: My master, his favorite book was the
Shiva's Dottravali.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a celebration, a song that was
written when Utpaladeva was on the boat
[SPEAKER_07]: and he was just singing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just in ecstasy singing on the boat
and his devotee was writing it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's just praising Lord Shiva,
praising Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he describes all of the sex.
[SPEAKER_07]: He describes the hula sex, the agora sex.
[SPEAKER_07]: He describes the right-hand path,
the left-hand path, the no-hand path.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says that all paths are a means to
achieve Shiva, whether you want to do
[SPEAKER_07]: nothing or do everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says the highest form of attainment
is devotion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Devotion will carry you.
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what you do, if you put devotion
in it, it will always carry you to the
[SPEAKER_07]: end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Devotion will carry you to all the yogic
powers, to achievement of whatever it is
[SPEAKER_07]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Devotion to Lord Shiva and everything that
you do is the means to attain whatever it
[SPEAKER_07]: is that you desire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it is so simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bholenath is always my favorite because he
is so simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I strive for that simplicity.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why going forward, I want to make
things as simple as possible for
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's open everything up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's make it simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the promise of technology,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people take for granted clean power,
clean energy, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's something if you go to India,
that's not something people have.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that's been as a huge
leap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sanitation, all these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be as Shaivites coming back like
the gods introducing all this beauty just
[SPEAKER_07]: in the same way they gave us beauty.
[SPEAKER_07]: We give beauty back to everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: We have such beauty.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have here is such a gift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you've literally discovered the
promise and now it's time to share it with
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chris, once again, for your
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Kaligla.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brother, that was beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there's there's no escape from
Shiva, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all returned to Shiva, that,
you know, all we can do is struggle a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inevitably, you know, the big,
the Inbreath and outbreath of the universe
[SPEAKER_02]: is the Big Bang and the return to the Big
Bang and the recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no escape, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing to do is just fall into the
to sync with it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find your place in that cosmic scheme,
your will, man, and be one with Shiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our next friend that's up speaking,
I see Doug's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made the technological leap and joined
us on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Doug as well, like Marcus,
has spent a lot of time in India,
[SPEAKER_02]: spent many years in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he has some, probably some
stories to share with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva related, ganja related, whatever you
can bring to the table, brother Doug,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you got to turn your, unmute your mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little spot there, see you,
unmute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be on the bottom left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottom left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I on now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to see you again, Chris.
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent seven years in India.
[SPEAKER_09]: I originally went there because I,
I was in the pop business in the early
[SPEAKER_09]: seventies and everything became
commercial.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I decided I'd go look for the hash
fields.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I went to India and when I was there,
I met some incredible people and had some
[SPEAKER_09]: incredible experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: I rode a motorcycle from one end of India
to the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I lived up in a place called,
in Himachal Pradesh, mostly was my base.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I was all over India.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in Himachal Pradesh, I lived in a
valley called the Kullu Manali Valley,
[SPEAKER_09]: Parvati Valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's very famous for quality hashish.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in one valley, Parvati Valley,
who is the consort of Lord Shiva,
[SPEAKER_09]: in a little town called, a village
actually called Manikaran, is a home of
[SPEAKER_09]: Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a Mandir there as well as the
Kuthura.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I lived in this area for years and
years and I became friends with this
[SPEAKER_09]: Nagababa who is a, Nagababas are priests
of Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_09]: They wear, they don't have much.
[SPEAKER_09]: They only have a blanket and a lungi and
they have a fire and they don't touch
[SPEAKER_09]: material things, money or anything like
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one Nagababa was the most
powerful man in a 500 mile radius.
[SPEAKER_09]: His name was Gopal Giri Maharaj.
[SPEAKER_09]: And which is funny because he has a
Vaishnava name, but he was a Nagababa,
[SPEAKER_09]: a Shiva Baba.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he lived next to this little temple in
a place called out, A-U-T, it's spelled.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he lived in the little shack beside
the temple.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was like the counselor,
the married counselor, he was the doctor,
[SPEAKER_09]: he was the ruler.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though he owned no possessions,
at all, he was the most powerful man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone respected this man to the max,
like the Pope or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he lived next to this little Shiva
temple, which I found really interesting
[SPEAKER_09]: because it had two altars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first altar was a Bhakwan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bhakwan is a Yoni and Lingam,
or translated in English, a vagina with a
[SPEAKER_09]: penis in the center.
[SPEAKER_09]: And on Shiva Rathri, everybody bathes the
Lingam and the Yoni with yogurt or milk,
[SPEAKER_09]: usually with a combination of cannabis,
like a Banglasi kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_09]: and flowers and garlands, and they have a
feast.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the one day in India where
cannabis is legal, being a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the nice thing was this little temple
next to him, the first altar was a
[SPEAKER_09]: Bhakwan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the second altar was a life-sized
deity of Lord Shiva and Parvati.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Lord Shiva is standing there and he
has a meter long penis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Parvati has her arms wrapped around
the penis, smiling so sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to love to take Christians there
because they would go, oh, that's
[SPEAKER_09]: perverted.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd say, oh, what's perverted?
[SPEAKER_09]: You worship a monkey on a stick,
come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that perverted?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to make them realize that the
different concept is not bad, it's just
[SPEAKER_09]: different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a very sweet concept because the
Bhakwan goes back to the union of the male
[SPEAKER_09]: and female, which begins life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in India, the oldest temples are
Bhakwan temples, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I used to love to take people there
just to show them, make their mind see a
[SPEAKER_09]: different light, a different view.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there's Nagarbaba and I.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got really lucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I went to India, I went back and
forth a few times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I lived in Boston at the time in the
States.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my doctor gave me a big bag of
tetracycline eye cream and other medicines
[SPEAKER_09]: like there was some penicillin also.
[SPEAKER_09]: And anyway, I took her with me to India.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know why I had all this medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to show you that Shiva has a plan,
when I got to India, I was living in this
[SPEAKER_09]: little village on the side of a mountain
and there was an eye flu.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then this eye flu took over all of India
and it made people, they couldn't see,
[SPEAKER_09]: they couldn't function in the light for
like two weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And this Nagarbaba and I, we went from
village to village to village and we
[SPEAKER_09]: treated people with this tetracycline eye
cream.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which reduced the sickness to like two
days.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were so lucky to do this,
to be able to help all these people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realized the doctor gave me this
without knowing, but it's God's plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a result, I would wake up every
morning in my little village I lived in
[SPEAKER_09]: and there would be potatoes and carrots
and all these cauliflower, all these
[SPEAKER_09]: veggies on my doorstep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the way that people repaid me.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a very, very sweet place to live.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was around 3000 meters up in the
Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a great experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have many, many stories, but I don't
want to take up all your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought just to share one story would be
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that just an intuition to give that to
them or like something told you that that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a good medicine for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how did you come up with the idea?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't, I just wanted to take anything
that was valuable back to India that I
[SPEAKER_09]: could take.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took seeds, I took grain, I took wheat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took all different things with me,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But because my doctor gave it to me,
I thought, well, I'm going to the third
[SPEAKER_09]: world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this will come in handy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was eye drops, tetracycline eye
drops of all things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when the Nagarbaba told me this flu
was taking over the villages, I was happy
[SPEAKER_09]: to go with him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we went out all over the world for the
next few days, village to village to
[SPEAKER_09]: village, treating people with tetracycline
eye cream and curing them of this horrible
[SPEAKER_09]: eye flu.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made some pretty good oil in India as
well, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blew a lot of Sadhu's minds with the
potent oil you were making.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was actually turning hashish into
honey oil, using petroleum ether as an
[SPEAKER_09]: extract and activated charcoal to clean it
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had a great big leaching pot that
held four kilos of hashish.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was making oils and living very
comfortably in India.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Nagarbaba, who was my friend,
he loved my oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was feeding him my oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he told the police not to bother me,
that if they did bother me, they would
[SPEAKER_09]: have to deal with him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, everyone was very much,
even the police, very much afraid of this
[SPEAKER_09]: man because he was the most powerful man
and he had all the people behind him.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the police never, ever bothered me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was sitting up in this village.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was illegal to make alcohol in this
village, but I was sitting there making
[SPEAKER_09]: oil because oil is a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like you were just protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had some kind of, yeah, you had some
protection force and maybe that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Shiva protecting you to do your
good work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a funny thing was when I was
living there, a bunch of people came down
[SPEAKER_09]: from Manali with like about 10 kilos of
hashish and the police busted them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my Nagarbaba friend went into the
police station.
[SPEAKER_09]: He took the hashish and says, this belongs
to Shankar and walked out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the police couldn't touch him,
of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he gave it back to the people
that the police took it from.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a great book called Cannabis,
Madness and Colonialism, and it's about
[SPEAKER_02]: the trouble the British Raj faced with
those type of individuals, the Naked Babas
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Naked Fackers and the Islamic
tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the British were, you know,
going in there taking over.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like during the British Raj,
but they would like be cruising down the
[SPEAKER_02]: streets in their in their wagons and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Naked Baba walked right out in the
middle of the street and stand in their
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they try to get physical with them,
it was a real line cross for the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can push people so much, but you start
like messing with their religious world
[SPEAKER_02]: and they will rebel in a heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was this tenuous situation where
they were able to make control with a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain amount of respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they crossed that line,
then the people would uprise, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were trying to figure out what
to do with these sad news and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where this scientific
explanation of, oh, well, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, quasi scientific explanation of
cannabis makes you mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: First originated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they started saying, well,
these guys are insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they put a medical term on it,
it was less of an offense to the to the
[SPEAKER_02]: locals and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just started grabbing up all
these sad news and stuff all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed the Indian relationship with
this holy herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the resonance of that British Raj
prejudice against ganja is really still
[SPEAKER_02]: there now in bread into the people of
India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And India should be leading the world in
medical marijuana and in cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would be leading if it wasn't for
that earlier influence of the British Raj
[SPEAKER_02]: demonizing Shiva's holy plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're correct there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They demonize the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is, in India, the Nagabavas
are very powerful and they have the
[SPEAKER_09]: backing of the people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the police don't have any control of
Nagas, because the people believe the
[SPEAKER_09]: Nagas are are saintly people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, I think your friend Mark from Nepal
is up next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he here or?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you send him the link?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought you'd send him that maybe
maybe he didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't think he's on my friends
list.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't on the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I'd mentioned that to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've got enough numbers I can send.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he know about it, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I never mentioned anything to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see if we can pull him in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't really sure about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just type for a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little bit about the Lingam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Doug mentioned the Lingam there
and this is a classic example of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Lingam inside the basin of the Yoni,
you know, and also and this is a Cobra.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can see that
representative like Kundalini energy,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is like the power of sex instinct,
you know, and this is a three face Shiva
[SPEAKER_02]: and it actually has over his phallus area
and erect Cobra serving as a Lingam,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I like this particular Shiva
a lot because I just ended up with it in
[SPEAKER_02]: my shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I have my shop,
I had a lot of different things come
[SPEAKER_02]: through, but he's got like a Chilam right
here on his belt ready to go and then
[SPEAKER_02]: right here, you know, erected with the
Cobra and he's also the three face Shiva,
[SPEAKER_02]: which goes with the three face Shiva
Chilam ritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Lingam is like, you know,
although it represents a phallus,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like the primal force, the driving
force of the universe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's really like, you know,
like just the drive for life, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like the primal force of it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's an interesting story in the
Puranas, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one of the things I like
about Shiva is it's kind of almost like a
[SPEAKER_02]: folk tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, and you're not stuck with the
dogmatic kind of view of some of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects, you know, some of the more like
fundamental aspects of Hinduism,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's all sorts of folk tales and
folk songs and that type of stuff around
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of an adaption of a
Puranic myth, as it was told to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the story is that Shiva was wandering
through the jungle and there was Brahmin
[SPEAKER_02]: women and they were at a pond washing
their clothes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shiva comes out of the jungle naked,
as he often, you know, generally was with
[SPEAKER_02]: his erect phallus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the women are like, oh my God,
what's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so they go running off to
their husband's Brahman's and they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, we were washing clothes and this naked
man showed up, a wild man with an erect
[SPEAKER_02]: phallus, you know, and they go,
oh, this is terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and they go down to where this
guy, they see him and they call it a curse
[SPEAKER_02]: down on him in the name of Brahma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his phallus falls off and it starts
ripping through the forest, burning
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in his path and destroying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and they go running to Brahma
and they go, Brahma, Brahma.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell him the story of their wives
washing clothes and the naked jungle man
[SPEAKER_02]: with the erect phallus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, oh, no, that was Shiva man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the procreative force of the
universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: He built a basin in the shape of a vagina
and bathed it and worshiped it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like kind of true,
I think, in a lot of ways of the
[SPEAKER_02]: unbalanced phallic age that we're in,
this patriarchal age that we're in and the
[SPEAKER_02]: unbalanced nature of the drive of the
patriarchy, whether it being swords for
[SPEAKER_02]: piercing and penetrating or bullets or
torpedoes or rockets for penetrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about dominating and penetrating
other cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why the sacred herb energy,
you know, the Yoni energy, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: present in cannabis, we grow ganja for its
female qualities, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what the symbolism of the
pouring of the bong on the linga is about,
[SPEAKER_02]: is restoring that balance, is cooling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva was introduced to ganja by Parvati
to calm him down.
[SPEAKER_02]: To stop his wanderings, to chill him out
when they were having a fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those are what the folk myths
say about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a really potent relationship,
this relationship between ganja and the
[SPEAKER_02]: male god, because the ganja balances the
male god with the female energy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're very right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: In India, Parvati, before she was Parvati,
her name was Sati, and she was embarrassed
[SPEAKER_09]: by her father, Daksha.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Shiva tends to get very angry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is why Parvati introduced him to
ganja.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he got so angry, he chopped off
Daksha's head, her father's head,
[SPEAKER_09]: because she burned herself up because she
was so disrespected by her father,
[SPEAKER_09]: her father disrespecting Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_09]: So she burned her body up and took another
body later as Parvati.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Shiva tends to get very angry,
and he replaced her father's head with a
[SPEAKER_09]: head of a goat, as he did with his own
son, Ganesh.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, ganja is really, it's the
balance.
[SPEAKER_09]: It saved my life, and I think many,
many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see another brother is here,
Sachan Raja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sachan, always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another pilgrim to his homeland,
India.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taken in a few Kumbh Mellas as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've invited Sachan to talk a little
bit about his experience with the Chilam
[SPEAKER_02]: in India and Kumbh Mellas, and to share
some of his wisdom with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Sachan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much for having me, Christina,
Chris, brothers, sisters in the world,
[SPEAKER_08]: ganja lovers, Shiva lovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all unite tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you let me know when you're ready for
me to pipe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a little bit, we had a missing
speaker, so we'll get you in a bit early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: My joy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, everyone, let's pull out the sacred
plant, the sacred herb.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another round for those of you who have
already gone through a few rounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: May all beings know peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: May all beings know truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: May all beings know love.
[SPEAKER_08]: May all beings be sanctified in the ritual
fire of truth and beingness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, let's all smoke to the great one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So friends, family, lovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So wonderful to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I have Indian roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was born in Uganda, Africa, raised
mostly in Canada, but I've been many times
[SPEAKER_08]: to India, and I had a wonderful sharing
years back with Chris.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris and I go back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been totally enthralled by his work,
but more valuable is who he is as a being.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a person who cares about the
illumination of society, not just his
[SPEAKER_08]: scholarly capacity, which is brilliant,
but the root of where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that's the root of Shiva
itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there's a term we have all heard of
in the Western world, Shiva as portrayed
[SPEAKER_08]: as the destroyer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would like to give you another
offering of the translation of the term
[SPEAKER_08]: Shiv.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is not as the destroyer in the
harsh sense, but a more accurate,
[SPEAKER_08]: artful translation would be taking into
account the sound, the energy,
[SPEAKER_08]: the language is the kind, K-I-N-D,
the kind dissolver.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first of all, if I could invite us to
re-script our way of thinking slash burn,
[SPEAKER_08]: kill, destroy, and look at it as what
within our personal existence and reality,
[SPEAKER_08]: what is within our personal existence and
reality that we fear in this time of
[SPEAKER_08]: letting go.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a huge time, the whole world on
multiple dimensions is being re-scripted,
[SPEAKER_08]: upleveled, corruption, craziness,
ego, all these factionings are all up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also feel, and I invite us to feel a
profound unifying sacred energy that is
[SPEAKER_08]: allowing the impurity to rise to the top,
the churning, the churning, to rise all
[SPEAKER_08]: the bullshit to the top, which we see,
which Chris is a great advocate of sharing
[SPEAKER_08]: the bullshit on the planet, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but underneath it, we must recognize
that Shiva, this energy within us is not
[SPEAKER_08]: an external God.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the God within, and this is the
aspect of the triune aspect of God.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the arising from the void into
consciousness, the Brahma, this creation,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're looking at each other moment to
moment, being re-created moment to fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: moment from nothing, and our bodies are
sticking together.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some fucking continuity,
which is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at it in some atomic level,
how the hell do we even have continuity?
[SPEAKER_08]: That is Vishnu.
[SPEAKER_08]: The continuity of existence, matter,
energy, time, and space is the Vishnu
[SPEAKER_08]: quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: The arising out of the void into
existence, into temporality, the temporal
[SPEAKER_08]: dimensionality is considered Brahma.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what is Vishnu or Shiva?
[SPEAKER_08]: Shiva represents that which in our being,
which is returning back into the void,
[SPEAKER_08]: returning back to the source of creation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the traditional yogic warrior approach
in the Kumbha Mela, the yogis taught me,
[SPEAKER_08]: the Nagababas taught me, says,
don't be scared of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be scared of dissolving.
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you be scared of the ultimate
benevolence and love on the planet?
[SPEAKER_08]: Love also shows up in a way which allows
things to dissolve and return back into
[SPEAKER_08]: the primordial elements of being.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ask you on a pragmatic level,
not just esoteric, all of us friends
[SPEAKER_08]: watching, listening, what in our life is
Shiva yanking us with right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: How is Shiva putting his trident in us,
shaking us up, pinching us, pointing us?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's three points, the heart, the mind,
and the belly, the soul, the sex.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the three tridents when Shiva is
active, is poking the fuck out of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: What for?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's looking for us to look for where are
we holding on to something that deserves
[SPEAKER_08]: to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a business we're holding on to?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a relationship we're trying to
resurrect, resurrect, resurrect,
[SPEAKER_08]: resurrect, but it's much better off to let
go and let go into the kind dissolving?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an ambition that you've been working
on?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going flat, flat, flat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're putting so much energy into it,
but you're not getting the return from the
[SPEAKER_08]: universe.
[SPEAKER_08]: That Shiva is saying this is not your
path.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of us have chosen and are walking
down paths that our parents have chosen,
[SPEAKER_08]: our society has imprinted into us that we
should walk, we should take.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a sacred time, my friends,
that I've experienced more than any other
[SPEAKER_08]: time in my life, where the willingness,
if we can find that willingness to what's
[SPEAKER_08]: the fear, what do I'm holding on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it my home, my location?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know my brother Chris has gone
through this of letting go of his home
[SPEAKER_08]: base for years and moving into a whole new
dimension, but I'm sure there was Shiva
[SPEAKER_08]: involved.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to face within himself all the
attachments for years of a home base that
[SPEAKER_08]: means something brings you calm,
confidence, brings you a sense of home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where in ourselves are we fucking holding
on to fear?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the biggest thing that Shiva is
saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for this to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a bad habit?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a limited thought?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not good enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no value in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let Shiva burn it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you think you're too big.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I need to be this, engrandize myself,
be this and this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We see this in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shiva will burn that down anyways.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shiva comes for those who self-engrandize
and tears them down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the force of the kind,
the benevolent dissolving.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might not look like it in the moment,
but it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other form, rather than
self-engrandizement that Shiva comes to
[SPEAKER_08]: purify, within our being to return back to
the void is self-depreciation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we holding ourselves small?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we holding ourselves less than
who we are?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you smarter than, are you smart in a
way that needs to come out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you radiant and beautiful in a way
that needs to be expressed?
[SPEAKER_08]: What needs to be expressed that fear is
holding you back with?
[SPEAKER_08]: This to me is the heart of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's take a few deep breaths.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like you to feel into your being.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to feel into your being what you
know right now you need to let go of.
[SPEAKER_08]: That you haven't built up enough courage,
confidence, time, contemplation.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in your soul, you know it's time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time to let go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time not to be ruled by the fear of
smallness.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the one thing you can let go of?
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have that, let that go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let that percolate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel the fear within.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel the, what would it mean if you let go
of that husband, that wife, that dog,
[SPEAKER_08]: that business, that coworker, that boss,
that employee, that relationship?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, rather than trying to do this on
our own, through our own personal will,
[SPEAKER_08]: let's connect with the grand will of Shiva
inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be in communion with that energy of the
kind dissolving.
[SPEAKER_08]: And rather than valiant ourselves,
become, push ourselves into the
[SPEAKER_08]: relinquishment of the fear.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about if we just offer the fear to
Shiva, for the sacred flame, the sacred
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Breathing in the life force.
[SPEAKER_08]: Knowing that with the deepest inhalation,
the drawing in of life, the drawing of
[SPEAKER_08]: Brahma, the sustaining of Vishnu.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, in the exhalation, the sacred
offering, even your fear Shiva will take.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even your attachment, Shiva wants and
yearns to absolve from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you give it to that great
disorganizing power of existence?
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you offer it without holding back,
being greedy with your limitations,
[SPEAKER_08]: holding your fucking smallness,
my smallness, to ourselves, prompting
[SPEAKER_08]: ourselves up to be the valiant nerds that
we think we are when we're really embodied
[SPEAKER_08]: gods, embodiments of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we anything less than the
embodiment of total consciousness,
[SPEAKER_08]: total love?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have a smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's smoke to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's smoke to Shiva.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come rock us with the greatest gentleness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus with his divine trident.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take that which is already denaturing that
we're holding on to, to keep its current
[SPEAKER_08]: form and allow the form to be given its
rightful completion package in path.
[SPEAKER_08]: Om Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.
[SPEAKER_08]: Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see, beloveds, family, world family,
I believe that we are all incarnations of
[SPEAKER_08]: Shiv and Shakti.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we have these beautiful couple in
front of us, the divine manifestation in
[SPEAKER_08]: their own unique form, never to be found
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: You and this one, you and this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet in our uniqueness, the union of
what is already the exact same also
[SPEAKER_08]: resides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Undifferentiated consciousness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Consciousness that's not limited by the
frames and the walls and the boxes we put
[SPEAKER_08]: around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us be wider than all those frames
right now, my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us manifest Shiva right here,
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: By becoming wider and wider and wider than
our minds, wider than our bodies,
[SPEAKER_08]: expanding our presence beyond the room
that we're in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Filling the room beyond.
[SPEAKER_08]: Filling the greater room of our town,
our city, our province, our state,
[SPEAKER_08]: wherever we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Filling the wider room of the country
we're in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Filling the wider room of the planet we
are in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Filling the wider room of the great vast
expanse Filling the widest room of the
[SPEAKER_08]: great infinite universe and universes.
[SPEAKER_08]: All Lokas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we expand out into the infinity of
being, we sit here with a beautiful smile.
[SPEAKER_08]: We inhale a smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, in the midst of our
humanness, the sacred already resides.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the midst of all the fucking calamities
that can come at us, we look at death in
[SPEAKER_08]: the face and say, smile with joy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come and get me, Shiva.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come and get me.
[SPEAKER_08]: To the great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Sanjay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a pleasure, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a very special man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming here and sharing your
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_08]: Om Namah, Shivaaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for viewers at home who have prepared
their bhang for the lingam ritual,
[SPEAKER_02]: time to get your lingam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that brass lingam?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the pouring of bhang on the lingam to
cure the heat, put out the fire of the
[SPEAKER_02]: male energy that's burning so much on our
planet these days, it's a very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very ancient ritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the big reasons that the bhang
on the lingam ritual was for was for
[SPEAKER_02]: malaria in India in the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big problem, malaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the ways that they would try to
beg Shiva to release it was by pouring
[SPEAKER_02]: bhang on the lingam to put out the fire of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're kind of suffering under a fever
these days in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The COVID has been pretty brutal,
man, for humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's surprising how interesting how
much medicinal cannabis has been effective
[SPEAKER_02]: for that for a lot of people in the
scientific studies going on around Shiva's
[SPEAKER_02]: plant in relation to COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all sorts of different angles that
it's being looked at for COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably good for malaria back in
the day as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that on this Shivaratri that
we should really all say a prayer for
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva to release humanity from the bonds
of this cruel COVID, which has taken loved
[SPEAKER_02]: ones from some of us, which we've seen
spread around the planet and changed
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's given humanity a pause for
reflection in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's Shiva's will that this has
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that it's time to move past
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we can all join together
in a prayer, pouring bhang on the lingam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's all focus and think of the suffering
that this COVID has caused around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The half a million people dead in America
alone, millions of people dead around the
[SPEAKER_02]: globe from this cruel, cruel disease,
unable to visit with our grandparents and
[SPEAKER_02]: our older people in isolation in their
last years because of the cruelness of
[SPEAKER_02]: this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's all ask Lord Shiva to release us,
release humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: From this fever and pour some bhang on the
lingam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my Shakti is going to take the honors
here and pour bhang on this lingam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to actually show what
the bhang looks like because people might
[SPEAKER_01]: not have seen it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're joining it, you don't have no
idea what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bhang is a traditional drink prepared with
cannabis in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Shiva's favorite drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have been preparing bhang for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vedic Soma may have been a drink very
similar to bhang.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certainly evidence indicating
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is Shiva's sacred drink since
time immemorial, the way he sought relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to pour some bhang on
Shiva's lingam as people have done for
[SPEAKER_02]: centuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can kind of chit chat for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard's not up for a few minutes yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever get a hold of Mark Rose,
Marcus?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I sent him like three messages to
three different numbers and Skype,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, saying what happened and what
we're doing and that he's involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's invited, but I don't even know where
he is in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole other, it's a whole other
country over there in Nepal where he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just think of him here and say a
prayer for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anybody got anything they want to add
in here or prayer or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to talk a little bit about what
Rol Shakti plays in the Kashmir Shaiva
[SPEAKER_07]: tradition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to say as quickly as I
can, because there's a lot of information,
[SPEAKER_07]: but in reality, we're actually Shakti
worshippers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We worship Satisfati or Sharada Devi,
which is one in the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharada is the goddess of knowledge and of
language.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharada is actually the three main
phenomes, the three mother phenomes put
[SPEAKER_07]: together, Sharada and Da.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we have Sharada, when we say we
have faith, Sharada, we actually have
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharada, which is possessed knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowledge gives us faith because when we
have knowledge, we have certainty and that
[SPEAKER_07]: certainty of will that willpower is
Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in our tradition, Shakti is willpower,
but it is Lord Shiva's willpower to do
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever he wants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in this way, we understand that there's
no such thing as Maya.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only the free will of Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is Lord Shiva's free will all
the time, including your free will.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, in chapter two of the Shiva
Sotravali, it says Lord Shiva's infinite
[SPEAKER_07]: power is found in every bit of Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Shakti, which is Lord Shiva's power,
is so infinite that she can reproduce
[SPEAKER_07]: herself infinitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even in the tiniest speck of Shakti can
produce the most infinite potential of
[SPEAKER_07]: Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even the tiniest grain of sand has
infinity in it, has Shakti infinite in it,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, our own willpower is like that grain
of sand that can expand into the grandness
[SPEAKER_07]: of Shakti herself.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Lord is so grand that each of us can
become a Shiva himself.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a secret teaching of Shaiva
Siddhanta.
[SPEAKER_07]: This means that we become ontologically
distinct Shaivas ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of us can become our own Shiva's
because Shiva's so grand that he can
[SPEAKER_07]: infinitely reproduce the infinite Shiva's
if you desire, if you will.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that willpower is Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: That willpower is Maya.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're one in the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this bondage is not bondage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is willpower.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you realize that it's all your
willpower, you're never going to be bound.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is infinitely your freedom to create
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you've got to put that willpower into
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's that in our tradition,
Shiva is that virya.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is that fire that he puts into the
Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then Shakti turns it into everything
good.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is the sacred cow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the proper worship of Shakti that
produces all the beautiful things in this
[SPEAKER_07]: world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like we must learn how to turn
that fire into love.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's why more than anything
cannabis teaches us how to turn that virya
[SPEAKER_07]: into something beautiful that blossoms
into something that's that's like
[SPEAKER_07]: something that allows us to see beauty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I more than anything want us to understand
that Shakti is beauty and she shines in
[SPEAKER_07]: everything and she has power and she is so
infinite that all of us have access to
[SPEAKER_07]: that infinity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she is everywhere if we allow her
to enter our life in every space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's some one of the guys I
really like that writes about Shiva is
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy, Elaine Danilow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this book here is Dionysius and Shiva
about the connections between Shiva and
[SPEAKER_02]: Dionysius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll maybe go into that a bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's another one of his books,
Shiva and the Primordial Tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the will the gods play the Shiva
oracles, which are all about Shiva in this
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predictions about Shiva in the Kaliyuga.
[SPEAKER_07]: His stuff is particularly different
because he gives a different timeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says that he went along with actual
yogis into the mountains to actual Naga
[SPEAKER_07]: yogis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he writes that he talked to them about
the real time cycles of the Kaliyuga.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, no, we're at the end of the
Kaliyuga.
[SPEAKER_07]: This forty three this four hundred year
thousand stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just Vaishnava misinterpretation
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Shaivites have the real dates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Swamiji says the reason why we opened
up the tradition is because we're at the
[SPEAKER_07]: end.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at Prahliya.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at the fucking end right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The world is fucking reciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time to open open everything up
because people are going to need these
[SPEAKER_07]: teachings.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like this is literally the armor.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like the lifesaver.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to come out and be like,
hey, guys, this is simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can give everybody what they need right
now in the moment where they most
[SPEAKER_07]: desperately need it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, brother, you said something so fucking
powerful.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just landed like like everything for
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is there is no Maya that what it
was determined or called Maya in some ways
[SPEAKER_08]: of perception is actually the the
embodiment of the will of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the expressing itself,
not some illusion to overcome or to kill
[SPEAKER_08]: or destroy or to robe or to heal.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and that to me is the essence.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so beautiful what you said and so
needed now with a world where most
[SPEAKER_08]: religions, many systems have an idea that
there's the illusion we must move beyond
[SPEAKER_08]: and transcend.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problem is is that we need to
enter whatever the thing we want to move
[SPEAKER_08]: away from that we think is illusion and
find the frickin truth of the willpower of
[SPEAKER_08]: who we are and how we are generating this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are generating this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I join you in recognizing this whole
existence as the form of Shakti.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next speaker, let me just introduce
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll pick this up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next speaker is an important speaker
in this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the things I mentioned
about the three children ritual was that
[SPEAKER_02]: Chandra Baba Chandra Kali there,
he invented it to be inclusive,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a really important,
important message.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and Shiva represents everything
between the two poles of the masculine and
[SPEAKER_02]: feminine, you know, everything in between
that every everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of religions in this Kali Yuga
age have rejected people that stand
[SPEAKER_02]: between those two poles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the masculine and feminine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They persecuted them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They burnt them at the stake.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've made them illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva's always embraced them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been part of Shiva energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our next speaker, Richard,
they're going to talk to us about this
[SPEAKER_02]: dual aspect of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_04]: Richard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoyed the conversation so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing I'd like to talk about is
Shiva.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing to kind of disclose about myself
as I identify as Androgyne, I identify as
[SPEAKER_04]: both masculine and feminine myself and in
my spiritual practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Christos, I'm a Thelemite.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of involvement with OTO,
the Gnostic mass, and particularly the
[SPEAKER_04]: teachings of Aleister Crowley.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I live in Baltimore and I
work in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually went to an exhibit on
Tantra and things like that over at the
[SPEAKER_04]: Smithsonian.
[SPEAKER_04]: They acknowledge Crowley's role in kind of
bringing a lot of these ideas into Western
[SPEAKER_04]: culture in that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of those figures who really made
it more accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really shows in a lot of his work
and the things that I study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to bring that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two things I wanted to talk about with
my time today was, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ardhanarishvara, the Androgyne aspect of
Shiva and Parvati, the combined aspect of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another, you know, I'm honestly still
learning a lot within the Hindu,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hinduism, but it came to my attention Bahu
Charamatha, who is the patroness of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hidra, the transgender community in India.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, one of the oldest extending
cultural transgender cultures in the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if I'm able to share my
screen, but I wanted to bring up an image
[SPEAKER_04]: of that real quick just for a post
disabled screen sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't put the screen sharing on for
Richard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me see if I can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, your entire screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it working?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, it's got to hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see my screen yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see anything on it, just your
name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go into the settings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, can you see my screen there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that's Bahu Charamatha,
and she's the Hindu goddess of chastity,
[SPEAKER_04]: fertility in her maiden aspect and of
incarnation of the mother aspect of
[SPEAKER_04]: Shakti.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's, as I mentioned, considered the
patroness of the Hidra community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have some images of the Hidra.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just recently started to study about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the Indian subcontinent,
the Hidra are eunuchs, intersex people,
[SPEAKER_04]: and transgender people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Hidra community in India prefer to
call themselves Kinnara, Kinnair,
[SPEAKER_04]: referring to the mythological beings that
excel at song and dance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the other things that's
interesting about them culturally is
[SPEAKER_04]: they're officially recognized as a third
gender in India being considered nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're either completely male or female.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a recorded history in the
Indian subcontinent since antiquity,
[SPEAKER_04]: suggested by the Kamasutra.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bring them up as a contrast.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some images of some of the Hidra
community here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are some more images.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bring this up as a contrast to what I'll
talk about with the Androgyne aspect for
[SPEAKER_04]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was interested to learn about these
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: With Ardhanarishvara.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll move over to the images of the
Androgyne next.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these are some of the images of
Shiva Parvati together in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Ardhanarishvara form, where the male and
female is split equally in half.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the other things that
correspond in Western occultism,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some images in here of,
for instance, the devil card.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were talking about the patriarchal
phallic energy that kind of is permeating
[SPEAKER_04]: the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Shiva, in the masculine sense,
is considered the ultimate masculine
[SPEAKER_04]: entity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in this Androgyne form, it's an
equally balanced masculine and feminine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the other things you see in
Western occultism, of course, the imagery
[SPEAKER_04]: of Baphomet, the Androgyne of arcane
perfection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the breasts of the female, the phallus
of the male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, kind of bringing these contrasts in
unison.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in alchemy, the alchemical rebus is
symbolic of the magnum opus, the great
[SPEAKER_04]: work, the idea of blending the male and
the female in one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I wanted to talk about what that
means conceptually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talked about... Let me see if I can
stop sharing my screen for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of becoming one with Shiva.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, but who does Shiva become one
with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Shiva becomes one with Parvati in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, like, how do we emulate that?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we incorporate that masculine and
feminine energy in ourselves?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were talking about the influence
it has on our world today, Chris,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also how Shiva is somebody who is a
caretaker of those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those people are all people,
because every human being, whether you're
[SPEAKER_04]: male or female, have those components of
that masculine-feminine energy within
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this form of Shiva, is kind of
symbolizes that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that's happening,
you know, Alastair Curley talked about the
[SPEAKER_04]: ages of the eons, the eon of Isis,
the matriarchal age, the eon of Osiris,
[SPEAKER_04]: the patriarchal age, and what we're in
now, what he would call the eon of Horus,
[SPEAKER_04]: the eon of the child.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the child was interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isis is very obviously
feminine-matriarchal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Osiris was symbolic of very
masculine-patriarchal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still moving out of that age of
Osiris.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of speaks to that masculine
influence you were talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: in some ways manifesting in intense toxic
masculinity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the solution to that isn't necessarily
to erase masculinity or to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually to that blending and
balancing with the feminine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what Horus represents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when Curley wrote about Horus,
he actually said the defining feature of
[SPEAKER_04]: the eon of Horus is this idea of both
sexes in one person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a child is considered episcene.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not fully, they haven't hit
puberty, so they're not fully male or
[SPEAKER_04]: female.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's this eon of the child and that
kind of imagery.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of that, I think Curley
was influenced by a lot of these ideas on
[SPEAKER_04]: what it means to blend the masculine and
feminine and what that creates in a
[SPEAKER_04]: person's consciousness, their view of the
universe, and understanding of self and
[SPEAKER_04]: others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to, there's a description of
Art Hunter Arishvara that I wanted to read
[SPEAKER_04]: off real fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, talking about how the two Shiva
Parvati combine each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: You understand he has to accommodate her
in his own body.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has to shed half of himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he shed half of himself and included
her.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the story of Ardhanashvara.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically trying to manifest that
the masculine and the feminine are equally
[SPEAKER_04]: divided within yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he included her, he became
ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is being said is that the inner
masculine and feminine meet, you are in a
[SPEAKER_04]: perpetual state of ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do it to try to do it on the outside
and it never lasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all troubles that come are,
that are an ongoing drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, it is not two people longing
to meet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is two dimensions of life longing to
meet outside as well as inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you achieve it inside, the outside will
happen 100% by its choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do not achieve it inside,
the outside will be a terrible compulsion.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the way of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the reality which is being
expressed in a beautiful dialectical form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shiva included her as a part of himself
and became half woman, half man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a symbolism to show that if you
evolve in your ultimate context,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will be half a man and half a woman,
not a neuter, a full-fledged man and a
[SPEAKER_04]: full-fledged woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is when you are a full-blown human
being.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not skewed development.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not just masculine or feminine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have allowed both these things to
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Masculine and feminine does not mean male
and female.
[SPEAKER_04]: The feminine and masculine are certain
qualities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only these two qualities happen in balance
within can a human being live life of
[SPEAKER_04]: fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was an interesting kind
of perception of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to move back to share my screen
one more time for a few more minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got a few minutes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if I can share this again real
fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to kind of talk about some of the
theology and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I pulled up a few charts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of talk about this idea of
Purusha and Prakruti.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Purusha is the unmanifested formless
passive beyond attributes, beyond cause
[SPEAKER_04]: and effect, space and time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Purusha is Shiva, the pure
existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Prakruti is Parvati, his goddess that
he combines with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prakruti is the creative force of action,
the source of form, manifestation,
[SPEAKER_04]: attributes and nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mahat is the cosmic intelligence or
Bhuti.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ahamkar is ego, the sense of I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Satva, Rajas and Thomas come into
manifestation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Thomas breaks down into the tapas
of earth, air, fire, water and ether as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's this idea that everything forms
from the interaction of these two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these two are symbolized by that
androgyne concept of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what's interesting is we are
meant to incorporate that into ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a model, you know,
like looking at that form and reflecting
[SPEAKER_04]: on it, meditating upon it, synchronizing
yourself with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you balance the masculine and
feminine in yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that even mean to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is masculinity to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is femininity to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do these parts exist within you and
how do you temper yourself to balance them
[SPEAKER_04]: and radiate them and exude them and live
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to also kind of draw your
attention to something interesting to me
[SPEAKER_04]: at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: The manifesto of Crowley's Gnostic
Catholic Church, the whole point of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Gnostic Masses, you know, I've had some
history of politics over this because I
[SPEAKER_04]: used to be able to be a priestess in
Gnostic Masses because when I read
[SPEAKER_04]: Crowley's works, I said, oh, that's what
I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I should be able to do any of
these roles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they put a bunch of really silly
gender restrictions on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want me doing public masses as
a priestess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, here's their manifesto that
Crowley authorized in 1944 kind of relates
[SPEAKER_04]: to this idea of the ages and the masculine
and feminine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the world has entered March 1904,
the new eon, the age of the crowned and
[SPEAKER_04]: conquering child.
[SPEAKER_04]: The predominance of the mother eon of Isis
and the father eon of Osiris are of the
[SPEAKER_04]: past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people have not fully completed those
formulae and they are still valid in their
[SPEAKER_04]: limited spheres.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the masters have decided the time has
come for the administration of the
[SPEAKER_04]: sacraments of the eon of Horus to those
capable of comprehension.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sexes are equal and complimentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every man and every woman is a star.
[SPEAKER_04]: The priestess must now function as well as
the priest.
[SPEAKER_04]: The expression of the above thesis and
public ritual is to be given by the
[SPEAKER_04]: establishment of the Gnostic mass,
which while adhering to the vital elements
[SPEAKER_04]: of the most ancient and true tradition,
fixes his attention on and aims most
[SPEAKER_04]: firmly in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, I just wanted to read a quick
quote, if I can find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some things Crowley wrote in
Magic Libra Abba Book 4.
[SPEAKER_04]: God is above sex and therefore neither man
nor woman as such can be said fully to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand much less represent God.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is therefore incumbent on the male
magician to cultivate those female virtues
[SPEAKER_04]: in which he is deficient and this task he
must of course accomplish without in any
[SPEAKER_04]: way impairing his virility.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will then be lawful for a magician to
invoke Isis and identify himself with her.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he failed to do this, his apprehension
of the universe when he attained samadhi
[SPEAKER_04]: will lack the conception of maternity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last quote before I just talk a bit
about discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: This constitutes a profound riddle of
holiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a comment on one of the holy books
of Philema.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those only understand it who combine in
themselves the extremes of moral idea,
[SPEAKER_04]: identifying them through transcendental
overcoming of the antinomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They must have gone further yet beyond the
fundamental opposition of the sexes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The male must have completed himself and
become androgyne, the female and become
[SPEAKER_04]: gynander.
[SPEAKER_04]: This incompleteness imprisons the soul.
[SPEAKER_04]: To think I am not woman but man or vice
versa is to limit oneself to set a bar to
[SPEAKER_04]: one's motion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the root of the shutting up which
culminates in becoming a Marian violet or
[SPEAKER_04]: a black brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me pop off my screen sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say connecting this to
the real world.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is happening in the real world around
LGBTQ issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now in the United States there are
tons of bills in the states right now on
[SPEAKER_04]: transgender athletes in high schools and
things like that saying we don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: transgender girls competing in sports.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not even that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: The United States legalized same sex
marriage like 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't even been like six years or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this progress is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me that is kind of that current of the
Eon of Horus, that progress that is
[SPEAKER_04]: happening, that spirit that is guiding the
evolution and the acceptance of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we do that I think in order to have
that acceptance we are moving away from
[SPEAKER_04]: where we were historically.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were talking about people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan of Arc, why was she burned at the
stake?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she broke gender norms.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you break a fucking gender norm society
is going to come get your ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me breaking the priestess taboo
over in Crowley's church, they came after
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got off bad report.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: They were so pissed at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I said no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said you guys, this is how I understand
my spirituality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you, some people understand me
over there of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the people that write the rule book
said no, we don't accept you, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do what we say or get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that what we are seeing in the Eon
of Horus, the idea of the child and both
[SPEAKER_04]: sexes of one, it is incumbent on every
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of how Crowley would, it is incumbent
on every man to invoke Isis, identify with
[SPEAKER_04]: her.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are talking about the same idea of
balancing Shiva Parvati in that form that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can reflect on with that androgyne
aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we bring that into ourselves?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that is sort of that 93 current to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That Philemic energy has a very
androgynous, Baphometic vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gnostic mass is numbered Libra 15 and
tarot card 15 is the devil card.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Baphomet who Crowley called the
androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane
[SPEAKER_04]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me I think it is incumbent on us to
reflect upon what androgyny means,
[SPEAKER_04]: what the balance of the man is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What female forces mean and what we can do
with that power in our lives to help
[SPEAKER_04]: change the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I will wrap up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the opportunity to talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Richard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is interesting you talked about Crowley
saying we had to bring into balance the
[SPEAKER_02]: masculine and feminine to achieve Samadhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is interesting about that is the very
first time that Aleister Crowley achieved
[SPEAKER_02]: Samadhi he was on hashish in 1904.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was written in his diaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't known until after his death
when his diaries were revealed because
[SPEAKER_02]: Crowley feared that people would reject
Samadhi if they realized it came through
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very special drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very special drug that is full of
female energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very special drug that was
recognized as the goddess, the tree of
[SPEAKER_02]: life and the age of world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is here now to balance the out of
control masculine energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is here now to pour the bong on the
eternal lingam of all male energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why this herb was so special to
Crowley.
[SPEAKER_02]: His psychology at hashish is all about the
attainment of Samadhi with ganja and
[SPEAKER_02]: practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes more than just ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would all be doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has got to be some intention in that
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently wrote an article you can find
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the cannabis infused wine of
Dionysius.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was going over that one of the
things I was really looking to come across
[SPEAKER_02]: is I had known about this connection
between Dionysius and Shiva because of
[SPEAKER_02]: other books but I never realized just how
intense the connection between Dionysius
[SPEAKER_02]: and Shiva was.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a historical fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 400 or 500 BC when Alexander went into
India he saw people there worshippers of
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva pressing the grape and making wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legends were that Dionysius had come
from this place Nysa which was one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: places they thought it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Alexander's mind when he came into
India he stumbled onto the birthplace of
[SPEAKER_02]: Nysa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is no lie that the devotees of Shiva
and the devotees of Dionysius recognized
[SPEAKER_02]: this was the same deity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This deity of ecstatic celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: This deity that accepted women power.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big part of the Dionysian
revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not some fancy of new authors like
in the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ancient authors wrote about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roman historians of that time period wrote
about this connection of Dionysius.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are connections between Dionysius
and Yahweh as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are coins minted with Yahweh and
Dionysius becoming the same god basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be quite an ecstatic religion
at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like Shiva religion in that sense of
that ecstasy that was based around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really powerful stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has Swami joined us yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he on board here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a couple of people maybe
have not made the technological leap to
[SPEAKER_02]: get on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was expecting a few other speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anybody got anything they want to say
here?
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Kashmir Shaivam tradition the goal
is Samadhi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yoga is Samadhi.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we think of the culmination of yoga
as being Samadhi and then Samadhi
[SPEAKER_07]: stabilizing we call it Samavessa.
[SPEAKER_07]: We call it the absorption of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: We become Shiva himself always.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't get to that point unless we go
first through Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the beginning we are Anu.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are just an individual not connected to
the universal life force.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we go through Shakti and she
initiates us.
[SPEAKER_07]: She connects us to the life force.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to let her in.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is like the grand teacher.
[SPEAKER_07]: She runs us through tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: She gives us milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go from being a little kid to then
growing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we integrate her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we integrate her then we go into the
Shambho mode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shambho is like the full culmination of
accepting everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you go into the highest mode you are
blissfully accepting everything because
[SPEAKER_07]: everything is Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is just pulsating with her.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is already being done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shambho just enjoys.
[SPEAKER_07]: His Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always making love to his Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: His Shakti is making love back to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am just making love to her all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just blissful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is pulsating wetness everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: The gnosis is persistent all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what we seek for is to always be
sucking on that Amrit.
[SPEAKER_07]: To always have that wine being poured into
the skull.
[SPEAKER_07]: To always be having him drinking the wine
of the senses.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is the senses.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is the wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is the bliss.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we let her into us and she allows us
to become it, we realize Shakti is the
[SPEAKER_07]: very self-reflective awareness.
[SPEAKER_07]: We say in Kashmishvism that the mind is
Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: The awareness is Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Shiva is the core of awareness.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we go I, that is Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we go M, that is Shakti.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, M is Shiva, Shakti together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is that constant self-awareness.
[SPEAKER_07]: The totality of all being everywhere,
everywhere is happening at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: That Shiva, Shakti, Shiva, Shakti,
Shiva, Shakti.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: All my love, I need to leave.
[SPEAKER_08]: But blessings on this wonderful occasion
and prosperous occasion for all of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bless you all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have another presenter with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Rachel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will let her maybe introduce herself and
tell us a bit about her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is going to take us through a
little bit of meditation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe while that is going on,
Swami will show up and we can tie it up
[SPEAKER_02]: with Swami.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us,
Rachel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so pleased to have some more Shakti
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned out to be a bit of a Lingam
presentation, Lingam energy here,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are trying to balance things out
here as best we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are really glad to have you here,
sister.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you are muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am so glad you are here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Selena.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is great to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an honor to bring some Shakti energy
to the Shiva lunch here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been listening the whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just joined now and figured out how to
do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy to be here with you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wow, what a wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: What amazing stories everybody has shared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so great to hear the enthusiasm and
really this Renaissance, the revival of
[SPEAKER_05]: celebrating Mahashivaratri.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am really honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a regenerative cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also like to honor the plant
medicine through ceremony.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what I would love to share with
everybody tonight is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: pranayama, breathing techniques that we
can use to really embody everything that
[SPEAKER_05]: we have talked about of understanding
Shiva and honoring Shiva tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also honoring our plant medicine,
the cannabis plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really finding that divine balance
with the Shiva and the Shakti energy
[SPEAKER_05]: through also chanting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say, even in the Bible,
they say in the beginning was the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so some say that word was om,
which is really a vibration.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I like to keep a foot personally in
each world of sort of being the bridge
[SPEAKER_05]: between the scientific world and the
spiritual world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you think about vibration,
if you look at it from one angle,
[SPEAKER_05]: it kind of is like a cosine graph.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you turn that towards you,
it becomes something physical in time and
[SPEAKER_05]: space.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're familiar with organic chemistry,
you might call this a confirmation,
[SPEAKER_05]: the way that molecules arrange themselves
in time and space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the vibration of sound,
when you look at it from a different
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective, it becomes matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It becomes light, something we can see and
obtain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so om was really all the vibration of
the creation of the universe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of you were speaking tonight
about the sense of creation, sustenance
[SPEAKER_05]: and disillusion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we sound om, it comes from our
own self and our body.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the oh sound really emanates from our
belly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you think about your belly,
your belly button, your navel,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was everybody's original life force,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Our umbilical cord is where we all began
our sustenance, our creation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the om, every inhalation and every
exhalation should, in theory, begin and
[SPEAKER_05]: end with our navel center.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'd like to invite all of us to do
in this moment is just practice feeling in
[SPEAKER_05]: to that space, to our space of creation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're familiar with the chakras or
the spinning wheel of energy, our navel
[SPEAKER_05]: center would be also called our solar
plexus or manipura.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that represents who you are,
who yourself is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I forget his name as he just had to
leave, but he was saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is it that you want on this planet?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is it that you literally need to
get rid of and remove so you can make the
[SPEAKER_05]: space?
[SPEAKER_05]: But tonight is such an auspicious night to
get so clear about that, that why,
[SPEAKER_05]: why are we on this planet?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really comes from the breath,
from the value, from the prana,
[SPEAKER_05]: that life force.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you, I'm going to sit over here so
everybody can see me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take your middle fingers and bring
them right to your navel center and have
[SPEAKER_05]: them touch, just sitting naturally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you find your inhalation,
let it begin at the belly and breathe in
[SPEAKER_05]: deeply.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fill your whole belly, fill your pelvic
bowl, and breathe into your wholeness,
[SPEAKER_05]: into your fullness.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we previously practiced, breathe into
the whole entire room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let your body take up the space around
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold at the top of the inhalation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with your lips closed,
again, the navel initiates the exhalation,
[SPEAKER_05]: the out breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slowly let the breath escape as you draw
your belly button and back behind your rib
[SPEAKER_05]: cage towards your spine, slowly letting
the air come out through the nostrils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you feel like you can't breathe
out any further, try to exhale a
[SPEAKER_05]: millimeter deeper.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you're doing a deep clean into
all the crevasses of your body,
[SPEAKER_05]: like we're dusting the corners of our soul
with our breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's try that again.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're ready, take a big inhalation
through the nose, slowly breathe,
[SPEAKER_05]: into your wholeness, into your fullness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And exhale completely, releasing it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you breathe out, you might start to
feel your fingers cross and pass over one
[SPEAKER_05]: another.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really letting your hands feel this
embodied space that you are creating.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can let your eyes close if that feels
comfortable to you and start to tap into
[SPEAKER_05]: and feel your own rhythm through your very
breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simply breathing in and peacefully
breathing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm going to offer a little prayer
for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have your ganja with you,
I have a little chilling pipe I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be using tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also made some bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been following along with everybody
and I'll show you here the bong I made.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you could see,
has rose petals and cardamom and fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used the flower so it's nice and strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely feeling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we breathe, when we work with the
cannabis plant medicine, we're inviting in
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the elements here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the earth being the plants itself,
the element of fire, we're creating
[SPEAKER_05]: transformation and change.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you bring the fire to the flower,
we create that transformation and change
[SPEAKER_05]: that creates the smoke or the ether.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're sending our prayers up to the
heavens, up to the gods and giving great
[SPEAKER_05]: thanks to Lord Shiva.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a mantra that I invite to share with
you all tonight is Om Nama Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we will, after we work with our
herb, we can practice our mantra 108
[SPEAKER_05]: times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's take a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're joining along with us,
I'm using a little hemp wick to give a
[SPEAKER_05]: tribute to smoking as clean as possible as
we always can, eliminating the butane from
[SPEAKER_05]: the lighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to take a moment to say a
prayer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Light the fire upon your flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Breathe in deeply
[SPEAKER_05]: and exhale it out to the gods.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I invite everybody to join me for
108 rounds of Om Nama Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're wondering why 108,
there's many different reasons why this
[SPEAKER_05]: number is so auspicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of which is the Sanskrit alphabet has
54 letters and each letter is seen as
[SPEAKER_05]: having a masculine and a feminine or a
Shiva and a Shakti aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you do 54 times two,
that equals 108.
[SPEAKER_05]: So giving homage to each of those letters
within the Sanskrit alphabet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you look at the number,
the number one may represent God or the
[SPEAKER_05]: creation or the wholeness.
[SPEAKER_05]: The number zero is the sustenance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the number eight looks like an
infinity sign, that sense of infiniteness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so together, we have the creation,
the sustenance and the disillusion.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's many other aspects of 108 from the
astrological perspective of the Vedas.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we look at Ayurveda in the sky and
seeing the way that we have 10 different
[SPEAKER_05]: houses and nine different planets,
sorry, 12 different houses times nine
[SPEAKER_05]: planets is 108.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we can chant, you can even do
1008 as well, but I thought we'd just
[SPEAKER_05]: offer 108 for today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some other interesting things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on a mala, if you see people wearing
these beads, today, they often have a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of aesthetic quality, but they really have
a deep purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: The japa mala is to, first of all,
keep track of count.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we count the mantras and a mantra,
man means mind and tra is a cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going across the mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our minds are always speaking to ourselves
or having this sense of chitta,
[SPEAKER_05]: what we call in Sanskrit is a chatter,
sort of that self-talk that we hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite often, the self-talk can be very
negative towards ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say how we speak to ourselves is
worse than we might speak to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this moment, I am inviting everybody
to just release that and see if you can
[SPEAKER_05]: use that mantra to bring in a sense of
loving kindness and the way that your mind
[SPEAKER_05]: can speak to yourself from here on out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we go across our mala beads,
the japa mala, we'll use, and if you have
[SPEAKER_05]: the beads, you're welcome to go along.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have them, that's absolutely
fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can join in the chant at any time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll use our thumb and our middle
finger to press on each bead.
[SPEAKER_05]: This center bead here is called the guru
bead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this bead, we give great thanks and
can bring to our third eye or Ajna chakra
[SPEAKER_05]: to give homage to our guru, to Lord Shiva
tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guru is the one who removes the
darkness so that we may see the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in doing this chant, it's really a
discipline, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes discipline to say something 108
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a commitment to something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you think about commitment,
think about two molecules bonding
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just inhale the ganja, and now we're
committing to her, to working with her as
[SPEAKER_05]: our plant ally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're committing to Lord Shiva,
to the Lord of the ganja, the Lord of the
[SPEAKER_05]: bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're giving great thanks to the plants,
to the universe, for our very existence.
[SPEAKER_05]: So give your whole self over.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a service that we're giving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more we put into it, the more
you'll get out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the law of attraction,
whatever energy that you're creating,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever it is that you're voicing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know for myself, I just want to
mention the first time I ever tried
[SPEAKER_05]: chanting, I'm not a singer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll probably hear tonight, but think
about it as your heart's song.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what you sound like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about being in a right tune,
but it's more just about letting your
[SPEAKER_05]: voice be heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Letting the gods, all of the divine,
your ancestors know that you are here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more from our heart, the bhakti is
from that heart center.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more we can sing there, the more our
prayers will be heard and answered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll begin together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a deep breath in through the
nose and out through the mouth,
[SPEAKER_05]: just clearing the channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Inhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And exhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be chanting Om Nama Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll begin on our first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Nama Shivaya, Om Nama Shivaya,
Om Nama Shivaya, Om Nama Shivaya,
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Nama Shivaya, Om Nama Shivaya!
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Nama Shivaya!
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep going with your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: Om Namah Shivaya.

[SPEAKER_05]: Stay present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Rachel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was beautiful and helps us get
centered for our last presenter,
[SPEAKER_02]: the great holy man Swami Chaitanya.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I pronounced the last part
right, Swami.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to correct me on the
pronunciation of that term.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on the bottom left.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bottom left.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not alone in mispronouncing the name,
that's why I usually just go by Swami.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chai like tea, chai, and tanya like a
ballerina or an ice skater, figure skater,
[SPEAKER_06]: chaitanya.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means consciousness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rachel was talking about chit,
and chit as such, chitananda, works into
[SPEAKER_06]: chaitanya.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are sort of one and the same at a
certain level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for inviting me on to
Shivaratri.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite an honor to be a guest here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Namah Shivaya chant, of course,
is one that we always chant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other ones too.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite ones for doing a
chillum or smoking ganja is you take the
[SPEAKER_06]: joy and you say, alakho deyapalak dekho
dunya kajalak, and behold, the wonders of
[SPEAKER_06]: the world revealed through the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a way of seeing the world as a
magical illusion and taking it to the
[SPEAKER_06]: higher level that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what to say about Shivaratri,
the idea that this energy is now walking
[SPEAKER_06]: the earth and being amongst us that is
celebrated as different incarnations or
[SPEAKER_06]: manifestations of Shiva, where Shiva will
just show up to you at a certain place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you'll look up and you'll see
that little sickle moon up in the sky,
[SPEAKER_06]: that little sickle moon.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say, oh, that's a sign from Shiva,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or something else will grab your attention
and you realize that, oh, that's a message
[SPEAKER_06]: from Shiva.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you see a beggar on the street or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of a sudden there's a little zap
in between.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say, oh, that was a little shakti from
Shiva.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the way that Shiva operates in
the world in his form as being in the
[SPEAKER_06]: present.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, he has a form of Shiva as the
Aghorasiva who is on the burning gods and
[SPEAKER_06]: being involved in that sort of
transformation where you cross over to the
[SPEAKER_06]: other side as the lord of the sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has this manifestation as a lingam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And normally on Shivaratri, we're pouring
over honey and milk and melted butter and
[SPEAKER_06]: ghee and all these things over the Shiva
ling that is then our worship ceremony
[SPEAKER_06]: where we can go on for hours and hours
pouring these libations over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the form of Shiva that is
beyond the expansion of the universe.
[SPEAKER_06]: That just the very conception of it
doesn't even put borders on the universe
[SPEAKER_06]: and all its multi-universes through the
time of creation and dissolution and the
[SPEAKER_06]: maintaining.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's Shiva.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Shiva does have a wrathful form
that is breathing fire and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sometimes called Rudra.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, Nikki just reminded
me, my favorite form of Shiva is Shiv
[SPEAKER_06]: Nataraj where he's dancing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the dancing, he is then creating
the universe through the Eksoat Tandava,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the 108 dances that Shiva
positions as he does in order to create
[SPEAKER_06]: the universe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we celebrate that same with 108
repetitions of the Panchadasa,
[SPEAKER_06]: this five syllable mantra of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Shiva is the center.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we think about the chakras
and the Muladhara chakra at the base of
[SPEAKER_06]: the spine, in that little triangle,
there is a Shiva lingam there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is then how we focus the energy
in the lower chakras and bring them up and
[SPEAKER_06]: transform them.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another lingam in the heart chakra
and another lingam in the third eye
[SPEAKER_06]: chakra.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how the energy is supreme.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the third eye chakra is like that
Jyotir lingam, the lingam of light that is
[SPEAKER_06]: absorbing all the energy of the universe
and radiating it back out to be shared
[SPEAKER_06]: with anyone who tunes into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even actually those who don't tune
into it share in the energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all the forms of Shiva as a
beggar and as a yogi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one of the great forms of Shiva
is with Shiva Parvati.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just as I say Shiva Parvati,
who comes in, but my Parvati, Nikhajira
[SPEAKER_06]: Nirmala is her Sanskrit name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she is my consort and beloved,
Shiva Parvati.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a certain place where Shiva
Parvati joined in a space above the third
[SPEAKER_06]: eye, the Shiva Shakti, the Kundalini
rising and joins there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you go beyond the duality of male and
female in that this is called the Kamakala
[SPEAKER_06]: Chakra.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in another triangle, there is the
Shiva and Parvati, they're united in the
[SPEAKER_06]: bliss beyond any time or space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we use the lingam as a way to
symbolize the essence of the energy
[SPEAKER_06]: without a physical form.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lingam is actually a representation of
a non-physical form or a physical thing
[SPEAKER_06]: with a physical thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the lingam is the simplest physical
thing as a source of energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we must always remember that the
lingam is embedded in a yoni, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lingam is embedded in a yoni and
that is part of the Shiva Shakti.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that Shiva without Shakti,
yes, there you are, thank you,
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris, Shiva without Shakti has no power.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it just occurred to me that we did
Om Namah Shivaya, but there's a variation
[SPEAKER_06]: that my teacher in India, Chiranandagiri,
gave me of the Shiva mantra and it
[SPEAKER_06]: includes the feminine, the Shakti.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think one of the great things about
this day and age is that so much of the
[SPEAKER_06]: religion has been masculine dominated to
worship the goddess and to worship the
[SPEAKER_06]: goddess equal with the god is one of those
things that our modern day wants to bring
[SPEAKER_06]: forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a form of, this was given to me
by Chiranandagiri, Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we put the syllable Hrim after Om and
Hrim is the syllable, the bija mantra of
[SPEAKER_06]: all the goddesses taken together,
but particularly it's the bija mantra of
[SPEAKER_06]: Bhubaneshwari, the goddess of the earth
and also Tukkura Sundari, the goddess who
[SPEAKER_06]: is the all embodiment of all the threeness
of the universe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we say Hrim, Hrim is like Om for
the manifested world, the manifested
[SPEAKER_06]: universe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om includes all the unmanifest and the
manifest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Hrim is where we bring it down through
the creativity of the feminine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll just do a few of these Om Hrim
Namah Shivaya since we start, I came on
[SPEAKER_06]: when you were doing Om Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we then incorporate the divine feminine
into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we'll just do that for just a few
minutes and we'll go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Namah Shivaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Om Hrim Nam There's three forms of japa.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is the out loud, the vaikhadi form of
japa, and that is great to do in a group.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the whispered form of the
japa, which is madhya form of japa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the silent form of japa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the silent form of japa is one that
you can carry on continuously.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of this base, like a tamburi
base note underneath whatever else you're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it just becomes... And you speed up
the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like... So you're creating this
rhythm and this kind of torque within
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself with the mantra.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happens is as through the mantra,
your bones start to vibrate with that
[SPEAKER_06]: tone, and eventually all the molecules in
your body vibrate with that tone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that tone, that sound, is the divine
you are invoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mantra is the divine.
[SPEAKER_06]: The yantra is the place for it to
manifest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's tantra.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway... Can I just say a couple
things I'd like to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is... And I know this from personal
experience, because it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say om namah shivaya with full pure
intention a hundred thousand times,
[SPEAKER_00]: expect big changes in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely... Because Shiva is the god
of transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you recite that mantra a hundred
thousand times... And it doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be all on the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when you've done it a hundred
thousand times with pure intention,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I wanted to say is
that right now, as some of you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: know, the Kumbha Mela is happening in
Haridwar in Uttarakhand state of India up
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Ganga.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tonight there'll be... Well,
it probably was 12 hours ago, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: huge celebrations happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Jalus, the parade,
when all of the Babas go out and parade to
[SPEAKER_00]: the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably happened this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tonight will be a very special time in
India, as literally millions and millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of people will be celebrating this...
Aarti, fire ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they'll be drinking bhang and
they'll be very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming from that direction on our globe
tonight is lots of higher consciousness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And whenever we chant OM and do those
mantras, our psyche, our mind,
[SPEAKER_06]: mental patterns join those of all those
people doing that, not only in India,
[SPEAKER_06]: but all around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the great thing about chanting
OM just by itself, is when you chant OM,
[SPEAKER_06]: you join the chorus of the syllable beach
mantra of the universe, which has been
[SPEAKER_06]: chanted since time immemorial.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll chant in time into the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we become part of that wave every time
you use the mantra of OM.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just a blessing to be here and
thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Swami, and your partner
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this has been a wonderful event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing these like small little
home Shivaratris the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of COVID, you know,
which seemed like a terrible thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it is a terrible thing,
but there's also this massive change
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in humanity right now because of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are all alone together,
you know, and we wouldn't have been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this if it hadn't been for COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here we are all celebrating
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to this is going to grow
in the West.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shivaratri is going to become a
celebration of ganja people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just and I thank you all so
much for making part of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say one more thing about
Shivaratri.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like Nikki mentioned the Kumbha
Mela, and that's when millions and
[SPEAKER_06]: millions of people go try and be and be in
the same place.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the edges of the Ganges, right,
the Ganga.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Shivaratri is completely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone goes to their local Shiva temple.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what we're doing here is your local
little Shiva temple.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: All around every Shiva temple tonight and
over the night, every single one of them
[SPEAKER_06]: has a celebration.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like everybody goes one place.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everyone goes to their place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why it has that extra energy
that it's your neighbors and your friends
[SPEAKER_06]: and people who've been worshiping at that
temple for such a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a whole myth about how
Shiva's, you know, all these millions of
[SPEAKER_06]: temples happened all over as part of the
Hindu mythology.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're doing the thing in the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think that in the Kali Yuga
that, you know, the Iron Age, the age of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, materiality and physicalness,
that an aspect of spirituality has taken
[SPEAKER_02]: on the physical form of ganja and a
medicine that we take body born of Shiva,
[SPEAKER_02]: from Shiva's own body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a really powerful way
to take the medicine, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with all of its intent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between a sadhu in India
who sits down with his children before he
[SPEAKER_02]: sits down to do his asana, asana practices
and some kid that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: about to smoke a blunt and play some video
game is an intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all in how you see this herb and
how you visualize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you put into that and take back
in with it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think on this, the final third
chelum, you know, of the three chelum
[SPEAKER_02]: ritual of today's Shivaratri 2021,
I just want to thank you all as aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiva that have come here today to share
your wisdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have any closing words,
you know, we'll just open up the floor and
[SPEAKER_02]: go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to share something really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But um, I love actually, what,
what's his name?
Nikki.
Nikki.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for adding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for adding that in about how
powerful the mantras are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a really powerful
experience a couple years back with mantra
[SPEAKER_01]: beads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had no idea what that would open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually had such a deep experience
that my whole yoga mat was completely
[SPEAKER_01]: drenched in tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm talking like a puddle of just
like an explosion of tears that came
[SPEAKER_01]: running out of my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really blasted me open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually like was really scary
looking back at it was it really shook me
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know if I was having a mental
breakdown or what, what was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was very intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you're right, like they are very
powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's very important that we
have tools to work with because the times
[SPEAKER_01]: are really intense and the times are
really intense and we need tools right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like Rachel was talking about
with the chitter chatter and Rachel,
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you so much for sharing with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really beautiful to hear you and
guide us through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much, Rachel, for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what you talked about with Om,
yeah, that's something as well too,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the breathing, um, these are
really important things that we have that
[SPEAKER_01]: are free that we can use and access at any
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, we just need to create the space
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the feminine, I think, you know,
um, setting up that space and that time
[SPEAKER_01]: and the right setting and, um,
using these plants, these medicines,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, with a way of, you know, for self self
awareness and the more that we become more
[SPEAKER_01]: self-aware we can become, uh, things
around us become better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like walking in our truth
and walking in our, um, leading of,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially I think for the feminine,
the beauty that comes out, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: been lost in our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very masculinized and,
um, remembering that beauty I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be another important aspect to
us, um, going forward, because I think our
[SPEAKER_01]: society's forgotten the beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and when I say beauty, I'm talking
like it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, we forgotten to look for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Special thanks to Mark Richardson too,
you know, for hosting the event here on
[SPEAKER_02]: his Zoom platform and YouTube and stuff
like that and, uh, taking care of the
[SPEAKER_02]: control board and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shankara, Shankara Mahadev.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a wonderful, beautiful experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I listened to the entire thing and,
and had full enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the P, I had no doubt that you would
invite high caliber folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so thank you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the, uh, more than 200 people
that have been watching have been,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I say one more thing if we have time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, we talked about mantras,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to talk about the secret mantra
of Kashmir Shaivism.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, you know, you were talking about
all the different forms of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is a tricky form of Shiva,
which there's a school of, of Shaivism
[SPEAKER_07]: that we call trika.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that appeals to the tricky part of us,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're think, if you think you're
clever, if you think you're cunning,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you think you're a tricky person,
well, you're going to understand what I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: going to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we're saying is that every time
you breathe, you're reciting the mantra.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you take a breath, you're
reciting the mantra.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you become aware of this and you
realize that you're, you're reciting the
[SPEAKER_07]: mantra 48,000 times a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you become aware that you're always
reciting the mantra, you're doing japa all
[SPEAKER_07]: the time, you're doing it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the trick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Swamiji used to say, you know,
Oh, was that, was that my master Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, bubble man doesn't know he's being on
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're, if you're a trickster and
that, that appeals to your mind and you
[SPEAKER_07]: think you can crack the trick and you can
always remember this trick, then you're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing japa all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all in the intention, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That japa is so hamsa.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the, that's the syllable of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hamsa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you breathe in, that's what it
sounds like if you listen to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing is hamsa is a Sanskrit
word meaning a swan, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the swan has all sorts of beautiful
connotations, symbologically, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we know as the ugly ducking becomes the
swan, but the swan is also, the swan is
[SPEAKER_06]: supposed to be able to take milk that's
dissolved into water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just drink the milk from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, it's, it's quality of discernment
of being able to detect the truth in the
[SPEAKER_06]: midst of the falseness, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that, that that's hamsa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you, as you say, if you breathe
that mantra silently all day long,
[SPEAKER_06]: but are you conscious of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you aware of living it that way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you ride on that wave.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would connect that mystery to the
mystery of Jesus walking on water.
[SPEAKER_07]: See that the, the swan also goes into the
water, but he's never like, he comes out
[SPEAKER_07]: of the water and he's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, I'm not wet, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, I'm, I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the water, but I'm out of it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, the world doesn't even touch me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I walk on it like no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually speaking of Jesus,
that reminds me when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you just said, Chris, that thing
about how Shiva is in this bud and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, you know, every time you imbibe
him, I, having grown up Catholic,
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately thought, Oh my God,
that's just like the host in church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're given the body of Christ,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd never quite put that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really interesting way to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bingo.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a boss for the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been so, so great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Shiva.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all Shiva to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
