Hey
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting here with Martin from Roor,
and we're over at High Integrity Glass
[SPEAKER_01]: Arts, which you have to admit,
some of the pieces we've seen up to date
[SPEAKER_01]: have been completely beyond stellar,
and right at the end he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did I show you my wife's new piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he pulls this out, and I'm like,
I don't know why I am so impressed with
[SPEAKER_01]: this, but man, this is one of my favorites
that he's shown me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a Darby-Nate Dizzle
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Cactus Dicro that Darby is
known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smallest Swiss Perk I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dizzle Swiss Perk, I don't know what the
red color is called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, Roe slapped on an
Elite Bucket from Mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just fits so beautifully,
I think I'm going to maybe have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, we've got the torch right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have this affinity for the
smaller piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the smaller and smaller
pieces, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the cups we were looking at,
those are small pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're by no means what I would call a
large piece, but it's interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got going on with this torch
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe out of gas?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the only other one right here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas technical difficulties here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be getting some gas right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could move the phone and take that out
of the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm balancing my phone up against the
other torch right now, which is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous, so here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got torches, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: High integrity glass doesn't mess around,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we'll get that dab prepared and
we'll have the whole thing all sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab being held off camera there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to pass that dab over,
Martin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get high with a little help from my
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited to hit this little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone was criticizing me today on
YouTube saying that I was hitting the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: too fast and that I would get a better
taste if I waited, and I don't think he
[SPEAKER_01]: understood that I was hitting hash instead
of oil, but here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's a very cool little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hats off to Dizzle and Darby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bet it.
I'll bet it.
