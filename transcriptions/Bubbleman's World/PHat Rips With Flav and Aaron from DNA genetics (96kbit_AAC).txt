[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting bubble-icious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the one that I have in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I didn't plan that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles!
[SPEAKER_00]: Imported to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacation style with these dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sitting in the LB right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: West West, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys, Aaron's come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron of course from DNA has come up to
enjoy this trip as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our families.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all taken up to Whistler for a
pretty awesome family trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, I guess what we're
gonna do is we're gonna test out Flav's
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo bubble hash out of all of these just
ridiculous pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the straight fab over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this bowl doesn't turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll trade you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now he has the bar cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to put it at an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's easier to torch the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a super fat pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he might need the bigger torch
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the little creme brulee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Switch!
[SPEAKER_03]: I on the other hand don't need a torch at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my little candle light right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My little tea light and my bee line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So romantic around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say we hit this Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the 120.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit the 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit the 73?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys get the 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hit the 120.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually haven't even tried the 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want us to hit the 120 out of
these fab pieces over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll press a little piece together for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get the little tool right there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to give you the fancy dancy
dabber eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be ninja about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an actual dabber eye?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think the actual dabber eyes
have this wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tools and stuff, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did Nick and T do those dabber eyes?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, some other guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is the happy daddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the happy daddy one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick gave me this in Amsterdam which is
a very nice little kick down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this titanium?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a dab for you my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're smoking what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, this is the Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lift this up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that's in the middle when I'm up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out for the teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we make the loud noises?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys can torch any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go up high and not get
torched in the elbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe my finger didn't get
burned.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was right here by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have the scar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a lifelong scar from the
e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should show them a picture of
Mark's finger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, your shit is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure it's hot enough.
You do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially for Hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?
Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a killer rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Switch?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the old deep game?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass the pipe to the left hand side.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: You keep that pipe right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rip I got out of this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rip that this one gives you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that cloud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a nice blue color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could talk about that Congo for a
second too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't see a melt factor on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a ton of melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I couldn't even see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sure got a nice feel to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a nice taste to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was older dried mostly flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure gave me a nice rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a rocker of a hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that pipe is absolutely astounding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a huge can with an absolute
ridiculous amount of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys can see how much
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like compared to a hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the can is very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far does the down stem go though?
[SPEAKER_03]: The down stem is massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's pull it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very big down stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: No I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No it's because I can see it from this
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it just goes below that first line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need actually quite a lot of water
in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: This really does like move on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I tipped it up the tiniest bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did this little woo woo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron was like whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch out for the pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well this is always one of my favorites to
hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This little mothership.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is by far one of my favorite pipes
ever made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like period.
[SPEAKER_04]: By any artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just such a beautiful little piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even after seeing all the beautiful FTKs
with the marbles and all the different
[SPEAKER_03]: opals.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just super classy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcel and Buck representing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's straight to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to put all this other bells
and whistles on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The round opals on it are pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even without those it would be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The solid stem on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: That solid white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the workmanship that's put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What people can't see is all the little
air bubbles in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the air trapping is absolutely
astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every little cross section.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcel actually told me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked about the reticellos and the air
trapping and like the history of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their Venetian techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the older families.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the more ancient families.
[SPEAKER_04]: That knew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you came into the tutelage of the
family.
[SPEAKER_04]: You literally were not allowed to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they would kill you before you were
allowed to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sacred knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being passed down to the individuals that
were under their tutelage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean like yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like these are ancient techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the more modern techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know like some of the stuff that Buck
does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it make it stronger?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just to do with the actual
difficulty of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the kind of tools and heat sources
that they had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they don't have like crazy torches
back in the day or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No I'm just looking at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still like a really nice piece of
quartz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_03]: No it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love club bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But would you use a club banger when you
got one of those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is you know beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the cut too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see how the oil is like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh is it that one or the other one?
[SPEAKER_04]: See how the oil is right on the underside
of the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know how I borrowed your purple
power or whatever in Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were like make sure flab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like these ones are purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: The orange cleaner or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: To clean my pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grunge off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And purple power I guess was the older
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Mark's always like dude like you
do this a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't always clean your pipes the
best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you clean these ones really
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I cleaned them really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I cleaned them spotless.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a tiny little smudge of oil
sitting on the honey bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fucking guards didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had me in there for like two and
a half three hours looking at my pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were swabbing them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever swabbed the bull down?
[SPEAKER_04]: I told them they were used.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like I torched all the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I torched any resin off of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they actually took all the buckets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took all the swings.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took all the pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_04]: No in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming back into Canada from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the FTK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they took it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were just sitting there like
deleting text messages on your phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had my phone already actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most fucked up thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's your phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a search warrant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can't come to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate seeing you get in my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even get to get my passport
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know who the fuck I am because
you got a nine hour, three hours from when
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought my ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try this one now?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 120?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see that show though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Border Customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one with Flav though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where he's got 250k worth of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy's like they're all talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I've never seen anything like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're not even really sure how to
proceed with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're interviewing him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like this is $250,000 worth of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm legal literally out those doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is ridiculous that they're even
talking to me about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a federal exempted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would just be such a great
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually sort of how it went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well because it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you wasting your time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I could literally walk out into the
airport, go right out front in the smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: section where everyone's smoking their
cigarettes and burn the shit out of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is there an issue?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can see clearly that I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to hide it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like I'm legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were used.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have any through of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one would have got them through.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have broke that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't even let them touch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one won't be traveling across the
internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm driving I'd do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After getting fucking searched like that,
brother, I wouldn't be traveling with my
[SPEAKER_00]: shit either, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one and that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that I worry the most about is
if they could say, because like in Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: technically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like paraphernalia is illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the viewers out there,
Canadian viewers know that, but it
[SPEAKER_04]: technically is illegal paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, at the border.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in the cell paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_04]: To possess it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of fucked up because all
these beautiful fucking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco use.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all tobacco resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: All for tobacco use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these pipes are tobacco water pipes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fire up my tobacco torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want the small one?
[SPEAKER_03]: For that little guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you guys should.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's so huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have the B line, please?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A, beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: B, exceptional glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: C, good peeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good peeps.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the beginning of a good,
long, week-long adventure that we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are going to see a lot of
footage from us in some fairly different
[SPEAKER_03]: situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what comes of it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I personally am very looking forward
to the bobsledding on the Olympic course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told Mark, I've got a brand new pen
that's specifically designed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bobsledding, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm in the tuck, I'm going to be
hitting the pen, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark says that pen's going to be gone in
two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, there's no way, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I want to hit it on the
bobsled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, it goes 125 kilometers an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, what's that, like 20 miles an
hour or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, like 75 or 80.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 80, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be on just a sled, not in a vehicle?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, luckily, they have a driver,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and they have a train breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so we don't have to, we just sit in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how it goes,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if we all get to go
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, are they going to tell you that
you're going to have to break,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a vacation, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a vacation, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be like, bro,
I'm going to be responsible for these
[SPEAKER_04]: three other fools in the front of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only the course where the dude died
in the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to be responsible for you
two, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to five-man bobsled, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be like, one,
two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been down it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll bring the GoPro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, we'll bring you guys with us so
you can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: From that to the cat, to the snowmobiling,
to the ice cave, to the back country
[SPEAKER_03]: snowmobile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need a snowmobile to get to the ice
cave?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll need to get a snowmobile,
too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Snowmobile is essential to get to the ice
cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about riding on the back of a
snowmobile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's no homobiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just side by side is what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Side by side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, side by side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means one guy's holding half of the
steering wheel in the middle, and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: standing on one side of the sled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other guy's over here,
holding the other middle and the other
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of your homies has the cliff side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the throttle side, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited, actually, to do a snowmobile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: From all the pictures you've always showed
in the videos and everything like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's one of the things I'm most hooked
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be some of the most epic footage if
we can get out on the sleds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even to just get simply out to Sprout or
Brandywine, which is just the back country
[SPEAKER_03]: of Whistler, just across the Sea to Sky
Highway on the other side is so
[SPEAKER_03]: ridiculously beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Ryan's been posting photos for
the last couple of days, and you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: even believe how beautiful the photos are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just taken with a cell phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be very nice if we could get back
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like this travel well in a little
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready for my last rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to go back to the
original Kongo, the 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to bring this around for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's like a gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just think of it like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't put it on that mat, because holy
did it slide on that mat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't slide when you lift it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like there's condensation from
the amount of water that's sitting in the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is I want to rewatch the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to risk this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one can go over to you, and I'll take
this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have your legal right to bear
arms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arms of joyousness, not distraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I came up with a subject that we
brought up tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Guns?
[SPEAKER_00]: The gun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toy gun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toy gun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's okay in Canada is not necessarily
okay in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get shot for a toy gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just encourage playing with toy guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just period.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: My son never even plays with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that thing got taken out
of his toy chest and out here for your
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your daughter was all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows I've been trying to kill ...
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, she knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like driving for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to take a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're professional as it comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: There definitely is a learning curve to
hit all of Flav's glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all has different little nuances and
trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Singularity is what makes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never bad to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love singularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should just bring singularity up for
the piece to be in the Whistler in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of the table the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else is in Whistler right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else is in Whistler right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a big crew of friends that are in
Whistler that I'll be able to introduce
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys all to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got these three brothers that I'm
good friends with, Ryan and Ethan and
[SPEAKER_03]: Devin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're up there all the time,
living the life of the snowboarders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this all one glass artist or is this
a collab?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's Buck and Marcel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially Marcel blew the can and all
the sections.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Marcel made the sections and then Buck
made the skeletal structure of the fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of his major designs.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is that piece is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the piece that rocked me the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got mild hits out of this one and this
one, but this one gave me an absolute
rocker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a really good hit off that one,
but this one has a really good hit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel uncomfortable with it because
it's such artwork and functionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, it's not mine and I don't
work for my own money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like expensive pieces like that size.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the sharp parts, like the teeth
and the spines and those are the parts
[SPEAKER_04]: that are hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of being careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to hit fat glass and you want
to be able to appreciate it, then just
[SPEAKER_03]: respect that each piece deserves to be hit
in a particular way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way you might grab this piece will not
be the way you grab that piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty fat though, that opal right
down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so sick, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes a while before you see that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with the eyes, like Ratticello
madness.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another opal right if you turn it
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it glow?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not glow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sure damn near impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color other than Ratticello is Depe's
darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic Depe's darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear a lot about that on the internet
in the glass forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are chatting about that color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we've done a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good session of ripping each one of these
pieces, each one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first of many.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you guys tomorrow for Hash
Church, which is Sunday, 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: West Coast time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll be wake and baking with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, I guess we've got one more day
here before we're going to head off to
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistler.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Whistler adventure will start soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Aaron from DNA and Flav421 with the
Epic Glass Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to my collection for making these
videos possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Good Hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, always thank the Good Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work with the Good Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo Bongo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
