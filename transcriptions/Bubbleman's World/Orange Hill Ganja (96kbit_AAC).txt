Alright,
[SPEAKER_02]: so doing a little pre-soak here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting things nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's rocking the trim and the ice and it's
a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever pre-wash your trim?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little trick you can do with the
trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I make it, sometimes I wash the
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can filter it out and still save the
hash that is potentially lost as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're walking used to be under the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: General's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got quite a few planted in each
one.
So what I
[SPEAKER_03]: do, I chop the neem tree and throw the
leaves all over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a natural pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem oil, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've just got neem leaves all around
the area and it's protecting the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: from pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's great man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this pest, it also, it lives in the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so they eat like crow-fill or
whatever they take out the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, come down buddy and come over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Irrigation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way from the river, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You using gravity or a pump?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're using a pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just started flowering in the last week?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to look really nice already
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You notice how narrow the leaf is on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the cultivars here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you just have a lot of seed that's a
mix of seed that you plant and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: put them out or do you have an idea that
there's some varieties?
[SPEAKER_03]: I started out with the blueberry,
then I get some diesel and I mix them
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what I got, but I got
something nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure you do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a narrow leaf on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All over here we've got even the
vegetables growing right with the ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Kalalu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Kalalu growing with the ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: All over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you everything loves growing with
the ganja.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man, everything is a pest of the
ganja.
[SPEAKER_03]: Birds, ants, everything loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything loves it, not just the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: No sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all like, yeah!
[SPEAKER_03]: Goats, every animal, everything loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really tell that you've done a
lot of work in this little plot,
[SPEAKER_02]: fencing it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean even just to move this many tires
filled with earth and to plant and place
[SPEAKER_02]: them in this environment is a lot of work
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's commendable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ganja farmer is a hard working man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not work when you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, when you love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just becomes your passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only work when the fucking federal is
taking from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well good job man, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like what you got going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feed them basically water every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I use like the goat manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it inside the tires mixed with the
dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you water in the morning or do you
water at sunset?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well in this stage it's better to water in
the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those ones over there is best to water in
the morning because they could gather the
[SPEAKER_03]: energy to grow in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these ones they're flowering so they
water them in the night so they use the
[SPEAKER_03]: water to make big buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all the same ages but some of them
are faster than some because there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed train with the blueberry and the
diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some come looking like the blueberry and
some come looking like the diesel and some
[SPEAKER_03]: come looking like something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well you know some might call you a ganja
farmer but I call you a trichome farmer
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're also a hash man and you get
those trichomes off the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing for trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ganja man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah man, the ganja man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice, nice little garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice bigger tractor tires here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making up here and I get my dinner or
breakfast or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and if I didn't have to fence here
for the goats I'd be having like corns and
[SPEAKER_03]: beans and lots more stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm a wrecker and I'm also a
hustler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to hustle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just a hustler.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's so much more commendable
when you have the ethics of a worker to
[SPEAKER_02]: back up the hustler mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ant's Nest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we on an Ant's Nest right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This little one right here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the hole to get in but right
here is all the nest.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the nest.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well let's stay off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely reacted to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn ants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you thinking there John?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty awesome man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hearing about Bubble Man for the
longest time you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Said I wanted to meet him because he was
like my Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh this guy let me put food on my table
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man as long as you have hash you
always have some cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes you different than the rest of
the folks here having the bags and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really because everybody has to find
something to do and you know it's like you
[SPEAKER_03]: know when you find something you're good
at and something people respect you for
[SPEAKER_03]: you just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I owe it all to the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the General.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless up General.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want some water?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some nice freshly watered plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying it's a little jungle trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the rain they start shooting
up more shoots and that would definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: be something I wouldn't have known.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have thought that the water would
have burned the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: You pour it right in the top there don't
worry about it.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pour it out too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm just going to pour and you catch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
Alright man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright back to the session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the D-nail set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry the Dabinator set up over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the D-nail whip and silicone carbide
nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to do a little ganja session.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little hash session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the ganja field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright hey guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the beautiful beautiful Negril
Orange Hill up in the mountainside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over at the Hash Man's place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw his hash the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the handful of course on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got over 2,000 likes so we're stoked
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we wanted to see a little bit of
where that hash you know is being grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was able to bring us up the
mountain to one of these little fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants over there in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants in bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe about a couple of weeks into bloom
at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still looking very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful smell on the resin and we
thought we would have a little Dabinator
[SPEAKER_02]: session.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got the Mothership Fab Egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: The D-nail drop down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corycotton drop down with D-nail sick bowl
and the Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our little battery and I'm going to
hit a little Bubble Man brand orange
[SPEAKER_02]: creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the last that I have left and I
thought what better place to come and hit
[SPEAKER_02]: the last of some of this beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah it's just like butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to do a turp dip into the
Jack Frost because why wouldn't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turp dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the hash getting wet from the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you pull them out the hash is got
a little bit of a shine to it on the tip
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the turp dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right this may be my first ever
Mothership Dab in a ganja field in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome buddy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessed love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that changed the vibe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want some bigger loans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke as many bowls in this field as we
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have to run off and hide in the shade
every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also doing live Periscope and John's
filming as well for his channel which is
[SPEAKER_03]: Ming underscore media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ming underscore media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check those guys out on Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got Vimeo and YouTube channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really great stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice documentary and editing styles
and he's helping us out a little bit today
[SPEAKER_02]: holding the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to thank him out and maybe
offer him a dab.

[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of the weed let I view the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ganja is mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have been traveling to Kingston for
20 miles and hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have been sleeping on my job one
night like the clock lowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fresh vegetation with trees and with
flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have to stop and check my ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lick them up above.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a big head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want no ziggy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give me no palm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give me time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want no twiggy now.
[SPEAKER_06]: No to pop.

[SPEAKER_00]: Pass that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the way that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of the way that's to the mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: To go Maybe tree Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go that early?
[SPEAKER_02]: You only flower for 5-6 weeks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in Jamaica, due to the climate and
the weather, the plants doesn't grow that
[SPEAKER_03]: tall, so we got like basically 6-8 weeks
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: 6-8 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: These 55 gallon drums, are they your rain
catches?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I pump water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man, pump it from the river.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, maybe 2 every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's a hot sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: 250, so 100 gallons of water a day for
what could be anywhere from 200 to 300
[SPEAKER_02]: plants blooming in various different
stages, but actually blooming in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same...
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, little babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you plan on turning a lot of this
into hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, most of the trimmings in some
of the small plants goes into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great that you're using the
trimmings because I did see your hash and
[SPEAKER_02]: it sure looked a lot better than most of
the hash I see commercially available on
[SPEAKER_02]: the streets of...
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know this part of the country in
Orange Hill, the resin on the weed is
[SPEAKER_03]: higher than every other place I've been
to, so we can use the trimmings and make
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful hash too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you take pounds of weed too
sometimes and just make hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man, sometimes 5 or 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a pound of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to do it, respect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes guys want like a pound or a key
of hash and I got to make it for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man, I have to make it for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it dried and ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I definitely want to thank you for
inviting us up here to hang out and chill
[SPEAKER_02]: with you for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're going to make some hash later
on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we should film a little bit of that
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn you on to some new tips
and I want to get you some more bags for
[SPEAKER_02]: your kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be a simple transition for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, there'll be a whole couple of
experiences in between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: One love.
[SPEAKER_05]: My life, it's my life, it's my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's your life, it's your life,
it's your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we come together for one life,
we're coming from behind, behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: Showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spiritual warriors.
Showing the world our watch.
Spiritual warriors.
Showing the world our watch.
