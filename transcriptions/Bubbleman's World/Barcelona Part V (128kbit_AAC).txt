[SPEAKER_38]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_38]: I just got to the Spanavis Fair.
[SPEAKER_38]: I missed yesterday, unfortunately,
but ended up having a great day spending
[SPEAKER_38]: with friends, Ramon and Rick DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_38]: I bumped into Jigga and Flux, you guys
have seen on the last video.
[SPEAKER_38]: And now I've got myself a nice little
table set up with the Dabinator and some
[SPEAKER_38]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just going to wait for people to come up
and say hi and I guess we'll photograph
[SPEAKER_38]: and video some dabs and we'll see what
people are doing.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hopefully Jeff Church shows up later and
we do a little bit more rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: And yeah, just stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_38]: We're going to have a lot of fun here
today.
[SPEAKER_51]: This is the 90.
[SPEAKER_30]: Which one did you put in the secret cup?
[SPEAKER_30]: The 90.
[SPEAKER_30]: Interesting that the 90 cakes faster than
the 70.
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, this one, this one's got, this one has
been open now for three days.
[SPEAKER_43]: This one's done it's second day.
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_43]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_43]: She's got the water.
[SPEAKER_43]: The Warlock, the Warlock crumbled right
away.
[SPEAKER_43]: Really?
[SPEAKER_43]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_43]: It's just, it's just, it's just crumbled.
[SPEAKER_38]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_38]: That looks like waxes.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_26]: Dude, it looks, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a lot of email dabs right there,
sir.
[SPEAKER_26]: I need some new, I need some new feed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm always happy when the great gardeners
come by.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, there's one right here.
[SPEAKER_38]: Sometimes with that you just heat it up a
little bit first.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, did that smell good?
[SPEAKER_38]: Wow, nice work.
[SPEAKER_38]: That was like professional.
[SPEAKER_38]: It takes a gentle hand.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, both of us, those guys are super
awesome too.
[SPEAKER_38]: Like a local Spanish bag company.
[SPEAKER_38]: Both came over, they brought me a little
bit of hash, which to be honest,
[SPEAKER_38]: I've been smoking.
[SPEAKER_38]: You want to try it?
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not letting go of the mother shit.
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_43]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_38]: Matt's just doing this all over.
[SPEAKER_38]: He's probably been at three booths doing
this in the last half hour.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just roll around and barb people down.
[SPEAKER_38]: You're getting barbed on, dude.
[SPEAKER_26]: You got like 100 people, dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: We should learn how to say hold it in in
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barbara butt.
[SPEAKER_38]: Really?
[SPEAKER_38]: Barbara butt.
[SPEAKER_38]: It just sounds so awesome.
[SPEAKER_38]: Is this like Canadian accent?
[SPEAKER_38]: It's like Barbara butt.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just a barb.
[SPEAKER_38]: What are you doing, barb?
[SPEAKER_38]: Jesus, that guy's like out.
[SPEAKER_38]: I like how they run away after they take a
hit.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hell yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_38]: These guys are down for the bob.
[SPEAKER_38]: This was one person standing here when he
started this.
[SPEAKER_38]: He's like, hey, you want a hit at the
barb?
[SPEAKER_43]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_43]: It's the Barbara butt.
Dude,
[SPEAKER_43]: the mothership and the barb, they
coalesce.
[SPEAKER_43]: I just got to get my own mothership.
[SPEAKER_43]: I think we can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_44]: Mother shit.
[SPEAKER_44]: Mother shit.
Well,
[SPEAKER_38]: it's been four minutes, Matt.
[SPEAKER_38]: You've been going pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's barb.
Like thousands.
[SPEAKER_38]: Way better.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, you can have a picture or.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, barb.
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm happy to say that it tastes like
that when I grow it too.
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's like, you know, it's good to know
that you can get the seeds and then
[SPEAKER_38]: actually get that strain.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, because I don't think of myself as a
really amazing grower.
[SPEAKER_38]: I hadn't grown for a long time.
[SPEAKER_38]: My barb, both that Afghani and barb.
[SPEAKER_38]: And you kill the plants and overwater them
and do all these things and then don't
[SPEAKER_38]: expect to grow the fire.
[SPEAKER_38]: Five minutes, 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_38]: I think you got some people doubling up.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_38]: I wasn't watching either.
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm not a big oil guy, so I don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_38]: Take it easy, guys.
[SPEAKER_58]: Ask for barb.
[SPEAKER_58]: Ask for barb.
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, let's take a break.
[SPEAKER_43]: Break time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it took me like two weeks to fucking
put a leg to heel.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was expecting a bruise to come up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hey, look who it is.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hey, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, I just thought we better get a
little bit of footage for Bubbleman's.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, let's do that, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Show what his heads have been saying.
[SPEAKER_17]: Trues in the house.
[SPEAKER_17]: What do we got here, buddy?
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a little bit of Neville's Haze
heads.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is like after the material's been
beat up about five times to get heads off.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just went in again and dug it out
real more and done a static trick on it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then once we had the power,
we put it through the static trick again.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that got out a lot of the green
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_17]: Game changer on that, mate.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were a bit disappointed with Neville's
Haze yields.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been getting crazy, like 5% to 10%
on things like the Nicole.
[SPEAKER_17]: And 24K.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we had the super frosty Neville's
Haze.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we got like a percent.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: 2%, something like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's hit that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, so what do we got, right there?
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, let's hit that.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, here.
[SPEAKER_38]: You get to be my cameraman.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_36]: I think I took this from there already.
[SPEAKER_36]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_36]: One of my favorites, too.
[SPEAKER_17]: My son's middle name is Haze.
[SPEAKER_41]: Really?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's between you and Amit with the Haze
and Kuss.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got all sorts of good names.
[SPEAKER_16]: My wife chose Haze.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, really?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, like just a joke.
[SPEAKER_16]: She said, yeah, it always makes you so
happy.
[SPEAKER_53]: Smells beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got a very Amsterdam coffee
shop-esque smell to it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It does, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_17]: It reminds me of the S5.
[SPEAKER_38]: Pretty good time here at Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_38]: Lots of people are coming up, showing me
Hash and Vod.
[SPEAKER_38]: Coming and asking about the bags.
[SPEAKER_38]: Obviously talking about Hash Church and
Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's really cool how many people we're
actually able to touch through this
[SPEAKER_38]: audience.
[SPEAKER_38]: It is the YouTube channel.
Very cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've met so many people that have been
watching Hashtag, and they're here to meet
[SPEAKER_17]: everyone and see some heads and have a
dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's always a pleasure, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, so this gentleman just walked
up to me.
[SPEAKER_38]: He is Max from Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_38]: He's the gentleman that sent me the
Dabinator from Germany.
[SPEAKER_38]: So of course we want to give you a shout
out.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let me load you up with something first.
[SPEAKER_38]: Max from the, yeah, this is the barb.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, here you go.
[SPEAKER_38]: And this is a mothership, yeah?
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dabinator, show us that shirt.
[SPEAKER_38]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_38]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_38]: And did Brian from D-Nail ever get in
touch with you?
[SPEAKER_38]: Did Brian from D-Nail?
[SPEAKER_38]: He's going to.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I know he wants to talk to you and
figure some things out or whatever.
[SPEAKER_38]: So yeah, he liked your unit and that you
were using good components and that you
[SPEAKER_38]: weren't just copying and making it cheap.
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll hopefully hook you guys up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the word?
[SPEAKER_38]: Just love bubs.
[SPEAKER_38]: He just wants to try them.
[SPEAKER_38]: So we got Doug from THC and Hem Pudlim
here in the booth.
[SPEAKER_38]: He's showing us some fire.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is the bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_48]: Little bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_48]: And this is the bubblegum hash that won
third place in the resin category.
[SPEAKER_38]: I have to say, he just gave me a piece and
it is definitely, like I'm pretty darn
[SPEAKER_38]: happy.
[SPEAKER_38]: Most pieces of hash, I'm a little less
than happy.
[SPEAKER_38]: See this one, I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_48]: And here is the Le Sage.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, Le Sage.
[SPEAKER_38]: Did you have something to do with this,
Julien?
[SPEAKER_38]: Le Sage?
[SPEAKER_38]: C'est français?
[SPEAKER_38]: C'est français.
[SPEAKER_38]: That has a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, of course it does.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's Le Sage.
[SPEAKER_38]: So what did you do for that?
[SPEAKER_38]: How did we make Le Sage?
[SPEAKER_38]: We made it in Basque Country.
[SPEAKER_38]: Basque Country.
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is also Basque.
[SPEAKER_38]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to squeeze.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's far away though, eh?
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_38]: It would be nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: It would be nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_38]: You will film this for me?
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_38]: We're filming this right now.
[SPEAKER_38]: So we got Jeff Church in the booth.
[SPEAKER_38]: He has come by.
[SPEAKER_38]: Doug just offered me a few buds.
[SPEAKER_38]: And we're going to squeeze rosin out of
it.
[SPEAKER_38]: You really want to see this.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm telling you, I made some earlier with
this shitty Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Squeeze oil out of this in five seconds.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dabs of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Church is just going to be online.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's at the Hash Museum, but it's not open
to the public.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, so you got the bud?
[SPEAKER_38]: I got the bud.
[SPEAKER_38]: And then what is that?
[SPEAKER_42]: That's a bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_42]: Barcelona bubblegum right here.
[SPEAKER_38]: Right, not the Basque.
[SPEAKER_38]: That one's real nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: Almost a little more fruity.
[SPEAKER_53]: All right.
[SPEAKER_38]: You want to do it up on the table so
everyone can see?
[SPEAKER_53]: This is the Basque bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_42]: All right.
[SPEAKER_42]: Pop the flour in here.
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, so flour's in.
[SPEAKER_42]: This is the soil-grown rosin technique.
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, soil-grown.
[SPEAKER_42]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_39]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, soil-grown.
[SPEAKER_39]: And then one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_39]: All right.
[SPEAKER_39]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_39]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_39]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_39]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_39]: Rosin, yes.
[SPEAKER_39]: All right, I want a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_39]: Here you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_39]: Maybe clean that up.
[SPEAKER_39]: Excuse me, I threw the bud on the hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_38]: See that?
[SPEAKER_38]: He milked the oil right out of the bud,
Doug.
[SPEAKER_38]: Fresh, fresh.
[SPEAKER_38]: Fresh.
[SPEAKER_38]: No solvent.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just give that a wipe with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: You don't got to... I don't.
[SPEAKER_38]: But we could rip a piece off if you want.
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is, I have to show that it's real
bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_38]: It sticks to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_26]: Nice, I like that you got your med-tainer.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, but then you know it's bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_31]: It can stick to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_31]: If you can put posters up with it.
[SPEAKER_31]: Then it's all good.
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Matt Green, how are you?
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_38]: Revlon.
[SPEAKER_38]: He gets the good ones.
[SPEAKER_38]: Can you imagine one day where Jeff could
be like a Revlon model?
[SPEAKER_38]: Like holding one of these up?
[SPEAKER_38]: When I crimp my bud.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: But we squeezed the hash, we squeezed oil
out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_38]: Watch how easy he picks it up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, it's parchment.
[SPEAKER_38]: But you can also use the Teflon,
which is oil slick.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, they both work.
[SPEAKER_38]: This one works good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, dude, just half is perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_38]: The fact that it was a bud in his jar like
eight minutes ago, now it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_38]: dab in my lungs like 10 seconds later.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to admit in the 25 years we've
been doing that, that's pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: nice.
[SPEAKER_53]: I just want to solve it with a dab in your
lemon.
[SPEAKER_53]: It's a dab in that lemon.
[SPEAKER_53]: Oh my god, is that good?
[SPEAKER_53]: Sliver.
[SPEAKER_53]: No, I'd better not.
[SPEAKER_53]: Gooster.
[SPEAKER_53]: So good, like living hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Living hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Rossum.
[SPEAKER_38]: If there's something to be said,
hit a wall.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, snap.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's scraping it off the thing and
collecting it as a clear oil.
[SPEAKER_27]: The return is good?
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you learn the technique, the smaller
the bud, the more return.
[SPEAKER_27]: Too big of a bud and then it gets caught.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can still take this and smoke it or
use it in an edible or soak it in coconut
[SPEAKER_38]: oil.
[SPEAKER_38]: There's still some medicine, but this is
top quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_38]: You going for another squish?
[SPEAKER_38]: Here, I just turned it off because I'm
worried that you're going to heat it up
[SPEAKER_38]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful because if it smokes, there's too
much power going through it.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_38]: I just turned it back on too.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, there's some more Rossum.
[SPEAKER_38]: Gave probably 50% of what it just gave us.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_42]: It's like a best VHL color.
[SPEAKER_38]: Rossum.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, what's this for?
[SPEAKER_38]: To Rossum?
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, he'll do it.
[SPEAKER_38]: One second.
[SPEAKER_38]: He wants you to try this bud.
[SPEAKER_25]: Just a little bit.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_37]: Not too much or you open it and nothing's
there.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, that's his.
[SPEAKER_38]: Press it up and give him a dab.
[SPEAKER_38]: Fresh dabs.
[SPEAKER_38]: We're making hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_38]: You want to be really solid with this
pipe.
[SPEAKER_38]: Never really hit it from a weird angle.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's how the pipe will... The first person
that hit it today dropped this on the
[SPEAKER_38]: table.
[SPEAKER_38]: I was so glad it didn't break because
that's the only piece I have.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's what we got.
[SPEAKER_38]: Press it up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, nice field.
[SPEAKER_38]: Give him that poor thing on the right
there.
[SPEAKER_38]: My fingers are available.
[SPEAKER_38]: I can do it too.
[SPEAKER_38]: If you want to keep yours clean though
because you're operating the Rossum and
[SPEAKER_38]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_38]: Operating the Rossum.
[SPEAKER_38]: You're a Rossum technician.
[SPEAKER_38]: Rossum technician.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, Terry will have a machine that he's
going to be building.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm building a machine, mate.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm like, dude, like your water extraction
machine, dude, just sell them.
[SPEAKER_38]: Fucking bags.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's what I say to Terry.
[SPEAKER_38]: He was supposed to be the guy to sell the
bags in the beginning and instead of
[SPEAKER_38]: selling the bags, he was like,
I'm going to build a machine.
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_33]: Of course it never happened.
[SPEAKER_33]: Dude, at this point in our life,
we know that the majority of the great
[SPEAKER_33]: ideas we have...
[SPEAKER_33]: This is a successful business,
man.
[SPEAKER_33]: I can't execute.
[SPEAKER_41]: I can't execute.
[SPEAKER_41]: I got some kids.
[SPEAKER_41]: Fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: Marrowing.
[SPEAKER_38]: You got some flavors?
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_38]: Always some good representatives from
Italy, right?
[SPEAKER_38]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_38]: Did you see that guy's butt that we just
squeezed?
[SPEAKER_38]: Did he get a hit?
[SPEAKER_38]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_38]: I should have done that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: You make these in Italy?
[SPEAKER_38]: Where was this from?
[SPEAKER_38]: From Spain.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, from Spain.
[SPEAKER_38]: Old Rock Platinum Ice Walk.
[SPEAKER_38]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: Nice little resume.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's good, eh?
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_40]: And so, you were next.
[SPEAKER_40]: Someone else is a bud?
[SPEAKER_40]: What happens when you do it to us?
[SPEAKER_40]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_40]: In the screen?
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, in the screen.
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, let's do something.
[SPEAKER_42]: Let me press this really quick because I
promised it would dab at them.
[SPEAKER_42]: Two seconds.
[SPEAKER_42]: I got a fresh parchment for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to write the mothership.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a Taurus.
[SPEAKER_04]: One time.
[SPEAKER_57]: Yeah, you ready, bubble man?
[SPEAKER_38]: That's enough for me.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't need to take it all.
[SPEAKER_38]: I want everyone else to try.
[SPEAKER_38]: But I do need to try.
[SPEAKER_38]: La Sage.
[SPEAKER_36]: Actually, here.
[SPEAKER_36]: Hell yeah, I'm going to get it on film
when I get La Sage.
[SPEAKER_36]: La or Le?
[SPEAKER_36]: La.
[SPEAKER_36]: La Sage.
[SPEAKER_36]: La Sage.
[SPEAKER_36]: Can I just use this one here, then?
[SPEAKER_58]: This is the La Sage.
[SPEAKER_58]: We had the joint in us last night when the
bar rocked around the outside.
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, but that was the Barcelona bubble
wrap.
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_58]: A little bit different.
[SPEAKER_58]: Man, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_58]: Awesome tech.
[SPEAKER_30]: Makes it so available.
[SPEAKER_30]: Next up, Barb.
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, next Barb.
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so, go ahead and like whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just whatever you want to be the special
put in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_63]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to get back to the booth.
[SPEAKER_38]: I had one right here.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I just grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Doug.
[SPEAKER_38]: Always a pleasure, brother.
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for coming by and bringing the
party.
[SPEAKER_38]: I started the party, dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: Doug started the party.
[SPEAKER_38]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: All the great familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is good times right now.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful with that.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's going to be like nothing we've ever
used.
[SPEAKER_38]: I think you should use this for that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, it's going to be runny, bro.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is going to be the stuff that makes
someone pass out unconscious when they dab
[SPEAKER_38]: it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_43]: Second winner of Dab a Dude Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_43]: We're going to rosin it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_38]: Imagine you take your entry and you're
rosin it before you enter it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_42]: Whose butt was that one?
[SPEAKER_38]: That one was his.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's say, Jeff, let's say it's your dad.
[SPEAKER_38]: You take that and I'll get him.
[SPEAKER_42]: See how we have different text,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_32]: I like yours, though.
[SPEAKER_38]: The first time I tried to use it,
I ripped the paper like an idiot.
[SPEAKER_42]: That's the best thing about hashish.
[SPEAKER_42]: Everybody has a different tech because
they did it or they saw the buddy do it.
[SPEAKER_43]: A lot of time, it's just what you had
lying around.
[SPEAKER_43]: What can I do right now?
[SPEAKER_43]: All right, Julien.
[SPEAKER_62]: Un pour mon bon ami, Julien.
[SPEAKER_29]: Lasage.
[SPEAKER_29]: Show me that.
[SPEAKER_42]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_42]: That is pre-press.
[SPEAKER_42]: There's already rosin greasing out.
[SPEAKER_42]: So this is going to be epic right here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Barbson.
[SPEAKER_42]: This is my first time on the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_42]: Be careful with the heat on this one.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not going to be like butt.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_38]: Little shots.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: And you're welcome to use the smaller one
if you want.
[SPEAKER_38]: Real little shots.
[SPEAKER_38]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: Nuts.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't smoke it too much.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, I can't wait for the money shot when
he opens this.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's take a peek.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hold on, one more.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_42]: And there's a lot more to go.
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_44]: What?
[SPEAKER_44]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_44]: Barbson.
[SPEAKER_44]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_44]: Set that there.
[SPEAKER_44]: We'll get a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm going to take a shot.
[SPEAKER_38]: The smell is awesome.
[SPEAKER_38]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_38]: It looks like a marking a chef would put
on a dessert with like the raspberry
[SPEAKER_38]: coulis.
[SPEAKER_38]: With the mango one.
[SPEAKER_38]: Cake, resin, right?
[SPEAKER_38]: And fucking turn it into just.
[SPEAKER_38]: So now Matt knows why he would take his
six star and turn it to ten star.
[SPEAKER_38]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_38]: Ten star.
[SPEAKER_38]: See?
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, I haven't hit it yet, but I have
to admit like this could fuck someone up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_38]: You ready first?
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's fuck someone up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's just like the Shiva snot.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just so gummy.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Push it down and pick it up like snap.
[SPEAKER_38]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_38]: Like flat the way you were.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: And just tap it down like push it down and
then lift it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here, let me show you.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: It doesn't seem as tacky though.
[SPEAKER_42]: There he goes.
[SPEAKER_42]: Now he's got it.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, it's really terpy.
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_35]: It's like insane.
[SPEAKER_42]: Here, I'm just going to go for this little
section here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_38]: Someone hold this so I can do the camera.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Julien.
[SPEAKER_34]: Take one.
[SPEAKER_43]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_38]: We just made rosin out of bar,
full melt.
[SPEAKER_38]: Talk about a good time to roll up,
Joseph.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, that's strong as fuck, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_38]: You got rid of all the wax membranes.
[SPEAKER_38]: Here, Barb usually lights up the face.
[SPEAKER_43]: Sort of has changed it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_43]: I got to try it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, of course, dude.
[SPEAKER_45]: This is terpy.
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_45]: It's still fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, hook me up with a little one.
[SPEAKER_43]: But it's still tasty.
[SPEAKER_38]: Here, I'm just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, that's exactly the one I wanted.
[SPEAKER_38]: I thought you were going over there,
and then you went right to the little ball
[SPEAKER_38]: that I felt like I should be inhaling.
[SPEAKER_38]: Did you name that?
[SPEAKER_38]: I did have my name on it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Is that big enough for you?
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm just passing my camera out.
[SPEAKER_42]: So rosin coats your mouth.
[SPEAKER_42]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_42]: Nice work, sir.
[SPEAKER_42]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: It definitely changed, you're saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: It changed a good time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
OK.
[SPEAKER_42]: So second place tabbadoo right there,
right there.
[SPEAKER_42]: This.
[SPEAKER_42]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_42]: This one?
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_42]: From this?
[SPEAKER_44]: So nice.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, OK, that explains it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, that was really a nice experience
right there.
[SPEAKER_38]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to press it again.
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_22]: Press it three more times.
[SPEAKER_22]: I used the pipe once.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can press it in this three more times
and collect all the rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: I used the pipe once.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm just going to leave that one so people
can see.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful, because it's on the ground.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: You want to do it up on the table so
everyone can see?
[SPEAKER_42]: All right.
[SPEAKER_42]: Pop the flour in here.
[SPEAKER_39]: All right.
[SPEAKER_39]: So flour's in.
[SPEAKER_39]: This is the soil-grown rosin technique.
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, soil-grown.
[SPEAKER_39]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_39]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, soil-grown.
[SPEAKER_39]: And then.
[SPEAKER_39]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_39]: All right.
[SPEAKER_39]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_39]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_39]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_39]: Rosin.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_39]: All right, I want a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_39]: Here you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_39]: Maybe clean that up.
[SPEAKER_39]: Excuse me, I threw the butt on the head.
[SPEAKER_38]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_38]: See that?
[SPEAKER_38]: He milked the oil right out of the butt
dub.
[SPEAKER_38]: Fresh.
[SPEAKER_38]: No solvent.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just give that a wipe with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't, but we could rip a piece off if
you want.
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is to show that it's real bubble
gum.
[SPEAKER_38]: It sticks to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_38]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: I like that you got your med-tainer.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, but then you know it's bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_31]: It sticks to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_31]: If you can put posters up with it.
[SPEAKER_31]: Then it's all good.
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Matt Green, for the papers.
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_38]: Revlon.
[SPEAKER_38]: He gets the good one.
[SPEAKER_38]: Jeff Church doesn't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_38]: It was actually the cheap one.
[SPEAKER_38]: Can you imagine one day where Jeff could
be like a Revlon model?
[SPEAKER_38]: Like holding one of these up?
[SPEAKER_38]: When I crimp my butt.
[SPEAKER_28]: For press, the isolator is good,
this?
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: But we squeezed the hash, we squeezed oil
out of the butt.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_38]: Watch how easy he picks it up.
[SPEAKER_38]: No solvent.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's like wax paper.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, it's parchment.
[SPEAKER_38]: But you can also use the Teflon,
which is oil slick.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, they both work.
[SPEAKER_38]: This one works good, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, dude, just half is perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_38]: The fact that it was a bud in his jar like
eight minutes ago, now it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_38]: dab in my lungs like 10 seconds later.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to admit, in the 25 years we've
been doing that, that's pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I like the intelligence of it.
[SPEAKER_53]: I just saw the solvent was dabbing in my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_53]: It's yapping at all.
[SPEAKER_53]: Oh my god, it's that good.
[SPEAKER_53]: Slippery.
[SPEAKER_53]: No, I better not.
[SPEAKER_53]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_36]: So good, like living hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Living hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: There's something he said, hit a mole.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_27]: Ooh, this is tacky, scraping it off the
thing and collecting it as a clear oil.
[SPEAKER_27]: The return is good.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you learn the technique, the smaller
the bud, the more return.
[SPEAKER_27]: Too big of a bud and then it gets caught.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can still take this and smoke it or
use it in an edible coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_38]: There's still some medicine, but this is
top quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_40]: We're going to press this.
[SPEAKER_40]: I know.
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to send all the Spanish guys up
here.
[SPEAKER_53]: It's easier if they have fun.
[SPEAKER_38]: You going for another squish?
[SPEAKER_38]: Here, I just turned it off because I'm
worried that you're going to heat it up
[SPEAKER_38]: too.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful, because if it smokes,
there's too much power going through it.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_38]: I just turned it back on too.
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, there's some more rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: Gave probably 50% of what it just gave us.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_38]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, what's this for?
[SPEAKER_38]: To rosin?
[SPEAKER_38]: OK, he'll do it.
[SPEAKER_38]: One second.
[SPEAKER_38]: He wants you to try this bud.
[SPEAKER_25]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_37]: Not too much, or you open it and nothing's
there.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, that's his.
[SPEAKER_38]: Press it up and give him a dab.
[SPEAKER_38]: Fresh dabs.
[SPEAKER_38]: We're making hash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_38]: You want to be really solid with this
pipe.
[SPEAKER_38]: Never really hit it from a weird angle.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's how the pipe will shoop.
[SPEAKER_38]: The first person that hit it today dropped
this on the table.
[SPEAKER_38]: I was so glad it didn't break,
because that's the only piece I have.
[SPEAKER_38]: So what do we got?
[SPEAKER_38]: We got to press it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, nice field.
[SPEAKER_38]: Give him that poor thing on the right
there.
[SPEAKER_38]: My fingers are available.
[SPEAKER_38]: I can do it for you.
[SPEAKER_38]: If you want to keep yours clean though,
because you're operating the rosin stuff.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_38]: Operating the rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: You're a rosin technician.
[SPEAKER_38]: Rosin technician.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, Terry will have a machine that he's
going to be building.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm building a machine, mate.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, dude, like your water extraction
machine, dude, just sell them.
[SPEAKER_38]: Fucking bags.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's what I say to Terry.
[SPEAKER_38]: He was supposed to be the guy to sell the
bags in the beginning, and instead of
[SPEAKER_38]: selling the bags, he was like,
I'm going to build a machine.
[SPEAKER_38]: OK.
[SPEAKER_33]: Of course it never happened.
[SPEAKER_33]: Dude, at this point in our life,
we know that the majority of the great
[SPEAKER_33]: ideas we have are successful businessmen.
[SPEAKER_33]: I can't execute.
[SPEAKER_41]: Fuck,
[SPEAKER_41]: dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: Marrowing.
[SPEAKER_38]: You got some flavors?
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_38]: Always some good representatives from
Italy, right?
[SPEAKER_38]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosin, rosin, rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: Did you see that guy's bud that we just
squeezed?
[SPEAKER_38]: Did he get a hit?
[SPEAKER_38]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_38]: I should have done that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: You make these in Italy?
[SPEAKER_38]: Where was this from?
[SPEAKER_38]: From Spain.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, from Spain.
[SPEAKER_38]: Old Rock Platinum Ice Walk.
[SPEAKER_38]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: Nice little reservoir.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's good, eh?
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_40]: And so you were next.
[SPEAKER_40]: Someone else is a bud?
[SPEAKER_40]: What happens when you do it to this?
[SPEAKER_40]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_40]: In the screen?
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, in the screen.
[SPEAKER_42]: You want that?
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, let's do something.
[SPEAKER_42]: Let me press this really quick,
because I promised it with Dad,
[SPEAKER_42]: but then in two seconds, I got a fresh
parchment for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_24]: I want the mothership.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a Taurus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots on that one, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you ready, bubble man?
[SPEAKER_38]: That's enough for me.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't need to, like, take it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just I want everyone else to try it,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: But I do need to try La Sage.
[SPEAKER_38]: Actually, here.
[SPEAKER_36]: Hell yeah, I'm going to get it on film
when I get La Sage.
[SPEAKER_36]: La or Le?
[SPEAKER_36]: La.
[SPEAKER_36]: La Sage.
[SPEAKER_36]: La Sage.
[SPEAKER_58]: We had the joint in us last night with the
barb rocked around the outside.
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, but that was the Barcelona bubble
wrap.
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_58]: A little bit different.
[SPEAKER_58]: Man, that's a nice, awesome tech.
[SPEAKER_30]: Makes it so available.
[SPEAKER_30]: Next up, barb.
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, next barb.
[SPEAKER_42]: OK, so go ahead and, like, whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever you want me to squish,
put it in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_63]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: I had one right here.
[SPEAKER_38]: I got to get back.
[SPEAKER_38]: Doug, always a pleasure, brother.
[SPEAKER_38]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for coming by and bringing the
party.
[SPEAKER_38]: Started the party, dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: Doug started the party.
[SPEAKER_38]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: All the great familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is good times right now.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful with that.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's going to be like nothing we've ever
used.
[SPEAKER_38]: I think you should use this for that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, it's going to be running.
[SPEAKER_38]: Bro, this is going to be the stuff that
makes someone pass out unconscious when
[SPEAKER_38]: they dab it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_43]: Second winner of Dab a Dude Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_43]: We're going to rosin it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_38]: Imagine you take your entry and you're
rosin it before you enter it.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_42]: Whose butt was that one?
[SPEAKER_38]: That one was this.
[SPEAKER_38]: La Sage, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's hit Juneanna.
[SPEAKER_38]: You take that and I'll get him.
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to wait to do it until you got
the video.
[SPEAKER_42]: See how we have different techs,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_38]: I like yours, though.
[SPEAKER_38]: The first time I tried to use it,
I ripped the paper like an idiot.
[SPEAKER_43]: A lot of time, it's just what you had
lying around.
[SPEAKER_43]: What can I do right now?
[SPEAKER_62]: Alright, Julien.
[SPEAKER_62]: Un pour mon bon ami, Julien.
[SPEAKER_29]: La Sage.
[SPEAKER_29]: Show me that.
[SPEAKER_42]: That is pre-pressed.
[SPEAKER_42]: There's already rosin greasing out.
[SPEAKER_42]: This is going to be epic right here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Barbzin.
[SPEAKER_42]: This is my first time on the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_38]: Be careful with the heat on this one.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not going to be like butt.
[SPEAKER_38]: Little shots.
[SPEAKER_38]: And you're welcome to use the smaller one
if you want.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just real little shots.
[SPEAKER_38]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is going to be nuts.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't smoke it too much.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, I can't wait for the money shot when
he opens this.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's take a peek.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hold on, one more.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_42]: And there's a lot more to go.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_44]: What?
[SPEAKER_44]: Barbzin.
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_44]: Set that there.
[SPEAKER_44]: We'll get a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm going to take a shot.
[SPEAKER_38]: Smell is awesome.
[SPEAKER_38]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_38]: It looks like a marking a chef would
bring.
[SPEAKER_38]: Put on a dessert with like the raspberry
coulis.
[SPEAKER_38]: With the mango one.
Cake.
[SPEAKER_38]: And fucking turn it into just.
[SPEAKER_38]: So now Matt knows why he would take his
six star and turn it to ten star.
[SPEAKER_38]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, I haven't hit it yet, but I have
to admit like this could fuck someone up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Are you ready first?
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's fuck someone up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's just like the Shiva snot.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just so gummy.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, push it down and pick it up like
snap.
[SPEAKER_38]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_38]: Like flat, the way you were.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, and just tap it down.
[SPEAKER_38]: Like push it down and then lift it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here, let me show you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: It doesn't seem as tacky though.
[SPEAKER_38]: There he goes.
[SPEAKER_35]: Now he's got it.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, it's really turkey.
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, it's like insane.
[SPEAKER_42]: Here, I'm just going to go for this little
section here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_38]: Someone hold this so I can do the camera.
[SPEAKER_26]: The pipe.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Julien.
[SPEAKER_34]: Take one.
[SPEAKER_43]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_50]: We just
[SPEAKER_38]: made rosin out of bar full melt.
[SPEAKER_38]: Talk about a good time to roll up,
Joseph.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, that's strong as fuck, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_38]: You got rid of all the wax membranes.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barb usually lights up the face.
[SPEAKER_43]: Sort of has changed it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_43]: I've got to try it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, of course, dude.
[SPEAKER_45]: This is the turkey.
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_45]: It's still fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, hook me up with a little one.
[SPEAKER_38]: But it's still tasty.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I'm just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, that's exactly the one I wanted.
[SPEAKER_38]: I thought you were going over there,
and then you went right to the little ball
[SPEAKER_38]: that I felt like I should be inhaling.
[SPEAKER_38]: Did it have your name on it?
[SPEAKER_38]: It had my name on it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Is that big enough for you?
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm just passing my camera out.
[SPEAKER_42]: It's so rosin-coated.
[SPEAKER_42]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_42]: Nice work, sir.
[SPEAKER_42]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: It definitely changed, you're saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: It changed a good time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
OK.
Hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I take a picture?
[SPEAKER_42]: So second place tab-a-doo right here.
[SPEAKER_42]: This.
[SPEAKER_42]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_42]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_42]: From this to all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well,
[SPEAKER_38]: that was really a nice experience right
there.
[SPEAKER_38]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to press it again.
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_22]: Press it three more times.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can press it in this three more times
and collect all the rest.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_38]: Careful, because it's on the ground.
[SPEAKER_38]: More rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barb's not done yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Second press.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's coming out hard there.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's how I normally do it,
but I do it 230 degrees.
[SPEAKER_42]: That's hotter than that.
[SPEAKER_42]: So I did it like half the time.
[SPEAKER_42]: I did 15 seconds just now.
[SPEAKER_42]: 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_42]: Drip.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_42]: Stop moving it.
[SPEAKER_42]: A butterfly.
[SPEAKER_42]: Get
[SPEAKER_42]: it out.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_38]: I just go like this.
[SPEAKER_38]: Then open it again.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just push the button twice, and then close
the... Did you just get that?
[SPEAKER_38]: No, hold it up like this.
[SPEAKER_38]: And get a picture of the one on the left.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's full of bubbles.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, it is a worst shower.
[SPEAKER_15]: A butterfly,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_45]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dab it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here, let me clean it.
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_36]: Video tape of people taking my picture.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's an Oxydyne.
[SPEAKER_36]: Nice, though, that.
[SPEAKER_36]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, so Javier heard that we were
making rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: He came over.
[SPEAKER_38]: I was like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_38]: I got hash.
[SPEAKER_49]: So he's got the double fruit.
[SPEAKER_49]: I see you with him in YouTube and some
videos.
[SPEAKER_49]: Maybe, maybe.
[SPEAKER_42]: Great gardener really oiled up the screen.
[SPEAKER_42]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_42]: It's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll clean that later.
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, he got a whole row to do his three
kinds.
[SPEAKER_49]: Let's start with 45.
[SPEAKER_49]: I need a spoon or a dab or something like
this.
[SPEAKER_49]: A dabber?
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, look.
[SPEAKER_38]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, it's dirty, though.
[SPEAKER_38]: Don't put a dirty dabber in there.
[SPEAKER_38]: These are my people.
[SPEAKER_38]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: Making rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: 45.
[SPEAKER_38]: 45.
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll start with the 45.
[SPEAKER_49]: OK, or more?
[SPEAKER_49]: I put more or it's OK?
[SPEAKER_49]: We can do just that if you want.
[SPEAKER_49]: That's good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_38]: Because we're going to do three different
kinds, so.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just wants to have a little taste of each
one, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_38]: So we should get a new piece of parchment
out.
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, I have scissors right here.
[SPEAKER_38]: I have the box with the ripper on it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's nice looking.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_38]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like honestly, as nice as Barb was,
that's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, I mean, the Barb was juicing out of
the screen before we even applied heat.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barb's in.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, we got it?
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Preparing for rosin.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's really hot, though, so.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, well, dude, twice the power.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Twice the power.
[SPEAKER_38]: OK.
[SPEAKER_38]: So here we go.
Here we go.
[SPEAKER_38]: Open it right up in front of him.
[SPEAKER_38]: I got that for you.
[SPEAKER_38]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll keep my fingers on the outside.
[SPEAKER_38]: We should be OK.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you like a dab?
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.
[SPEAKER_49]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_49]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_49]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_49]: Amazing, amazing.
[SPEAKER_49]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_38]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_38]: Pick him up a dab, like not a huge one,
because he's working, but give him a
[SPEAKER_38]: little taste.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_49]: Do you want to do it when he's done with
it, so you can pick the dab up for him?
[SPEAKER_49]: Is there less quality?
[SPEAKER_49]: 45, amazing.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, it's like up to six star.
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm interested to see how it changes for
you.
[SPEAKER_43]: How it changes from smoking this,
from you smoking this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_43]: You smoking this.
[SPEAKER_43]: It changes.
[SPEAKER_43]: I know, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_49]: There's a whole profile to it that's done.
[SPEAKER_49]: Normally, I like more press, because
broken the terpenes and mix the oil and
[SPEAKER_49]: everything.
OK.
[SPEAKER_49]: But this is different.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's like the scar box slightly.
[SPEAKER_49]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_49]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_49]: Right down here, I'll grab you a dab.
[SPEAKER_49]: OK.
[SPEAKER_49]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_49]: Small one, please.
[SPEAKER_49]: Just get him a nice one like you get me.
[SPEAKER_49]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's so, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_49]: Pull and snap.
[SPEAKER_49]: Shatter.
[SPEAKER_49]: Hey, I know.
[SPEAKER_38]: Baby dab.
[SPEAKER_38]: But the taste, and because he knows the
strain, you know, it's his, he smokes it a
[SPEAKER_38]: lot.
[SPEAKER_38]: 45 micron.
[SPEAKER_49]: Amazing.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_49]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_49]: That was?
[SPEAKER_49]: That was his double fruit.
[SPEAKER_49]: Double fruit.
[SPEAKER_49]: 45.
[SPEAKER_49]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, 45.
[SPEAKER_49]: Half plant.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's nice quality, but.
[SPEAKER_49]: I must try it out.
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_49]: Transform the taste.
[SPEAKER_49]: This is just getting out of control.
[SPEAKER_38]: Look at your fucking parchment,
dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_49]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_49]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: He can roll that up in a second and do a
little patty in the middle so it's all
[SPEAKER_38]: clean.
[SPEAKER_38]: I could do it as well.
[SPEAKER_38]: But I like the film.
[SPEAKER_38]: I catch Jeff doing it and it looks better.
[SPEAKER_38]: It is a butterfly.
[SPEAKER_38]: Snap, snap.
[SPEAKER_38]: Beautiful butterfly.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's got a hole in the middle.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's like a fucking trophy.
[SPEAKER_38]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's just 45.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's try the 73.
[SPEAKER_42]: So much smoother.
[SPEAKER_42]: Like it cuts out that little bit of
harshness that you get from any
[SPEAKER_42]: contaminant you might have.
[SPEAKER_42]: That's double fruit.
[SPEAKER_42]: Yours has very little.
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's like, but it's like that waxy
cellulose membrane that holds all the
[SPEAKER_42]: resonance.
[SPEAKER_42]: That's what you're not getting.
[SPEAKER_42]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: So today.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I kill it with this.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_38]: You're going to win contests with this.
[SPEAKER_38]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_38]: You'll take like 20, 46, 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_38]: People will be like afraid.
[SPEAKER_38]: Having heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_49]: But I imagine big pieces.
[SPEAKER_49]: You can make big pieces.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, big, nice.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can make them.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just a little bit at a time and then.
[SPEAKER_38]: The quality is on point.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's really tricky.
[SPEAKER_33]: We're puffing right now.
[SPEAKER_33]: What a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_33]: 420.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, that was.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, that was Barb.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, it's different.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is fun and exciting.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's like we feel like I'm at the edge of
the cutting.
[SPEAKER_38]: I know.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, have you?
[SPEAKER_38]: I got him on tape going.
[SPEAKER_38]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_38]: Wait, that dude right there that you just
showed how to make this.
[SPEAKER_38]: You'll win like a dozen contests in the
next year.
[SPEAKER_38]: Roz made his.
[SPEAKER_38]: He wrote the book.
[SPEAKER_33]: He wrote the extraction thing.
[SPEAKER_42]: He's like, yeah, let's press out all these
things.
[SPEAKER_42]: And we did one.
[SPEAKER_42]: He's like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, another level stepping up.
[SPEAKER_38]: I just am thinking of how many contests
Javier will win doing this in the next one
[SPEAKER_38]: year.
[SPEAKER_38]: How many will you win?
[SPEAKER_49]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_49]: Maybe the same as Trey.
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_42]: Man, yeah, it really brings the flavor of
each screen out so much more.
[SPEAKER_49]: Something different price because I make
me this experience.
[SPEAKER_49]: David.
[SPEAKER_49]: Fresh frozen is amazing, but this is like
a next.
[SPEAKER_42]: I had tests done on the before the rosin
and then the after and the turpene content
[SPEAKER_42]: went up from six points.
[SPEAKER_42]: Four milligrams per gram to seven point
four milligrams per gram.
[SPEAKER_38]: It gained some more turpene's after he
made it because he got rid of the wax
[SPEAKER_38]: membranes.
[SPEAKER_42]: It's exactly so.
[SPEAKER_42]: But it didn't even the heat did not
destroy everything.
[SPEAKER_42]: And it was only slight.
[SPEAKER_42]: There was only a third.
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, we're back at it.
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is the bud.
[SPEAKER_38]: I love Hayes.
[SPEAKER_42]: A little tiny bit like you expect with
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, it's got the small resin heads.
[SPEAKER_42]: Let me gather that dab up together.
[SPEAKER_38]: To gather up two dabs because I want to
taste that deep nevels.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's the deep nevels.
[SPEAKER_38]: I think I want to try the next one.
[SPEAKER_49]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, he's totally.
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, because he had no understanding of
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_42]: You twist this up and ball it up and print
that in the silicone.
[SPEAKER_42]: And it squirts cash oil out.
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, like little chips.
[SPEAKER_37]: Little chip.
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, it's a little wee chip.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can actually eat it.
[SPEAKER_36]: No fucking way.
[SPEAKER_36]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_36]: You did it that easy.
[SPEAKER_36]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not really enough for a nice one.
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, it varies.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a dab though.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's all that's there.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's all that's there.
[SPEAKER_38]: Why use this?
[SPEAKER_38]: This is a pizza box.
[SPEAKER_38]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_38]: Like when I order a pizza, I don't eat the
box.
[SPEAKER_38]: I take the pizza out.
[SPEAKER_38]: If you go to a shitty pizza spot,
I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm all 90 micron pizza.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just a second pull.
[SPEAKER_48]: See if I get it.
[SPEAKER_42]: So I got barely a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_42]: It's still right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_38]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_38]: Two thumbs up for two tears down.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: I like the shirt.
[SPEAKER_38]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, what was that?
[SPEAKER_38]: Turn?
[SPEAKER_38]: Turn the best shit into better shit if
that's possible.
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_43]: Second place, non-solvent dab adieu.
Barb.
[SPEAKER_38]: The sin of Barb.
[SPEAKER_38]: The look on people's faces as we've been
doing this throughout the day has just
[SPEAKER_38]: been like, so wait a second, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, look at it coming out.
[SPEAKER_38]: You get the drip in.
[SPEAKER_38]: The thing is how ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hey, Al, you seen this?
[SPEAKER_38]: Squeezing oil at a hatch.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's Barb.
[SPEAKER_38]: We got to hit that.
[SPEAKER_38]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_38]: He hit it in the middle half.
[SPEAKER_38]: He hit it.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_38]: But he had his tested, and the fact that
that karyophylline was present.
[SPEAKER_38]: It shows that the heat can't be destroying
too much.
[SPEAKER_38]: Rosin test, uh, uh, soil grown.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's had his tested, and it was 70% THC
oil.
[SPEAKER_38]: Non-decarboxylated, decarboxylation
doesn't happen in two seconds with 200
[SPEAKER_38]: degrees temperature.
[SPEAKER_38]: You need like the extreme temperature of a
flame or a nail to decarboxylate
[SPEAKER_38]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's garbage.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's right here.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, look at that.
[SPEAKER_38]: Are you kidding me, bro?
[SPEAKER_35]: That's really sick.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_38]: Now, Don, Don, go back to high school for
a second, and just think, all of these
[SPEAKER_38]: kids with access to dabs that never had
access, they just had shitty weed they
[SPEAKER_38]: could get.
[SPEAKER_38]: Bro, we could have been doing this
forever.
[SPEAKER_38]: I know.
[SPEAKER_38]: My sister had a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_56]: I like.
[SPEAKER_31]: Rosin with a great gardener.
[SPEAKER_31]: Trying it for my first time making rosin.
[SPEAKER_31]: Aaron from DNA.
[SPEAKER_38]: Don't burn your finger.
[SPEAKER_38]: Don't burn your finger.
[SPEAKER_38]: Push down with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_38]: Push down with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_38]: And then only for a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_38]: And then open it up and kind of do it
again.
[SPEAKER_38]: Make sure, as you see it leaking out,
that's when you kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Cause that's hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd open it again.
[SPEAKER_38]: You don't want to burn it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Open it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Open it, open it.
[SPEAKER_37]: Now open that thing and show us.
[SPEAKER_37]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh yeah, open that up now.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's stupid, bro.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can just drop the pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, look at that dude, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_38]: Dude, it just started running down.
[SPEAKER_38]: Jesus, you're nerdy.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's sap.
[SPEAKER_38]: Extract.
[SPEAKER_38]: That was from the Jamaican bud.
[SPEAKER_38]: No, that was from some rosin that he,
like some of his nice hash.
[SPEAKER_46]: This is from the bar, from the bar.
[SPEAKER_46]: You just buy garbage.
[SPEAKER_46]: You just buy garbage hash brown and
squeeze the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_46]: Say that on camera.
[SPEAKER_46]: Or you just buy garbage hash and you just
squeeze the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_46]: And then you're like, good.
[SPEAKER_46]: Just like you can buy 200 pounds of any
weed and turn it into that clear bullshit
[SPEAKER_46]: and put some fucking terpenes in it and
call it 99 different strain names.
[SPEAKER_46]: This shit, this is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_38]: I gotta give it up, man.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's definitely cool.
[SPEAKER_38]: That is fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_38]: Barbzin.
[SPEAKER_38]: Drip it.
[SPEAKER_46]: So can you imagine, wherever you go now,
you just bring your fucking little hair
[SPEAKER_46]: iron now and you turn the trash into a
fucking stash.
[SPEAKER_38]: Three star to six star in five seconds.
[SPEAKER_49]: Because when you travel, you can't always
have the kind kind.
[SPEAKER_49]: That's why we're always struggling
sometimes in different places in the
[SPEAKER_49]: world.
[SPEAKER_38]: But you can take any of the local flavors
and just get 10 buds given to you and go
[SPEAKER_38]: home and have 10 daps.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's nuts, bro.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's safer.
[SPEAKER_38]: Young kids are pretty stupid.
[SPEAKER_38]: They can blow up.
[SPEAKER_38]: They can make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_38]: I make mistakes at 42.
[SPEAKER_38]: I wouldn't fuck around with it.
[SPEAKER_38]: But at 20, I for sure would kill myself.
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll tell you the secret machine they use
to make this shit, okay?
[SPEAKER_46]: The secrets.
[SPEAKER_46]: It's been out for a long time.
[SPEAKER_46]: What's the secrets?
[SPEAKER_46]: It's called the George Foreman.
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, the George Foreman rosinator.
[SPEAKER_46]: The George Foreman rosinator.
[SPEAKER_46]: The George Foreman will work.
[SPEAKER_46]: Because it's on an angle, they make sort
of fat drips.
[SPEAKER_46]: You just keep rosining your shit and it
will drip down into the tray.
[SPEAKER_38]: We just need to get D-Nail to create a
George Foreman, a silicon carbide heated
[SPEAKER_38]: tray.
[SPEAKER_38]: So that is the best heat source.
[SPEAKER_38]: We have a giant fucking t-shirt press at
the warehouse that's connected to a
[SPEAKER_38]: fucking air compressor.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm thinking that has to be in the top and
bottom.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, that works.
[SPEAKER_38]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_38]: Bro, you can get giant fucking slabs with
that thing.
[SPEAKER_38]: What you got to do is you got to put
parchment paper on the bottom and then put
[SPEAKER_38]: buds like two or three inches apart,
just popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_38]: You don't even need these.
[SPEAKER_38]: You just put more parchment on top,
give it a two second press, open it up,
[SPEAKER_38]: flick the buds off, and you collect the
oil.
[SPEAKER_38]: Bro, I'm going to do that in fucking
action.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's like new shit.
[SPEAKER_38]: Do you remember seeing those big bags of
fucking keef I had?
[SPEAKER_38]: You can rosin all that, bro.
[SPEAKER_38]: Or static some of it.
[SPEAKER_38]: So much easier than all the other methods.
[SPEAKER_38]: Or all of the above.
[SPEAKER_38]: Who's the one claiming this?
[SPEAKER_38]: Who's the kid that discovered this and
started doing it?
[SPEAKER_38]: Soil Grown really blew it up by pressing a
bud and getting oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_49]: Because it's simple as shit, but it took
some intelligence to actually do it.
[SPEAKER_38]: No, no, it's in the timing.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just social media and the ability to
share.
[SPEAKER_38]: You turned great in this super,
super group.
[SPEAKER_38]: I think you can still make more.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can.
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll be able to squeeze that two,
three more times, bro.
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not even the right color yet.
[SPEAKER_38]: You can't leave that on either or it'll
blow.
[SPEAKER_38]: But you can squeeze it one more time,
but squeeze it way less now because it's
[SPEAKER_38]: hotter.
[SPEAKER_38]: So really give it like a one or two second
or you might burn it.
[SPEAKER_38]: Take two.
[SPEAKER_38]: And the pressure helps with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_38]: Smoking a bit.
[SPEAKER_43]: You've got to figure out how to get all of
that out because there is a ton in there
[SPEAKER_43]: still.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's going to get refined.
[SPEAKER_49]: The method will get better and better.
[SPEAKER_43]: Kids that are out there now, you've got to
figure out how to get all of that out.
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll be busy growing.
[SPEAKER_43]: You guys figure it out.
[SPEAKER_38]: I think it's time to hit some dabs of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_43]: These guys
[SPEAKER_38]: brought us some nice bud.
[SPEAKER_38]: Alex, Christian, and Matthew.
[SPEAKER_38]: We're about to soil-grown that shit down.
[SPEAKER_38]: Jeff just got back, so I figured,
well, we better film more rosin making
[SPEAKER_38]: because we've only filmed like 48 minutes
of it today.
[SPEAKER_39]: A little bit of custard on the bud,
eh?
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to repress really quick.
[SPEAKER_39]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_39]: It'll come off.
[SPEAKER_38]: I've been doing represses.
[SPEAKER_38]: I've seen that a little bit where it's
just the placement of the bud or whatever.
Whoa,
[SPEAKER_42]: whoa, crazy.
[SPEAKER_42]: So this one's so fresh it's spitting out
green.
[SPEAKER_42]: That's neat.
[SPEAKER_42]: That's bizarre.
[SPEAKER_42]: I've never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_42]: I've seen purple.
[SPEAKER_42]: It's like a greenish blue and green.
[SPEAKER_38]: It looks green.
[SPEAKER_38]: Because of the moisture in the bud,
brought some chlorophyll out.
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's just see that green oil.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hold that up in the light.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's pretty tricky, guys.
[SPEAKER_38]: A little bit of fresh bud.
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, let's dab it up.
[SPEAKER_49]: It's like blue, like green and blue.
[SPEAKER_38]: Give him a dab.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just trying to keep your shit from blowing
up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to just step out for five
minutes, get a little bit of video from
[SPEAKER_38]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_33]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_33]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_38]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_38]: See you, man.
[SPEAKER_38]: Just doing a little tour video.
[SPEAKER_38]: Showing the products.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's a huge tent.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is the secret genre.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's a huge genre.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's the big books.
[SPEAKER_38]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_37]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_38]: Here's Barney's gigantic, ridiculous,
awesome booth.
[SPEAKER_38]: If you're going to do a booth,
well, looks like Dairy knows how to do it
[SPEAKER_38]: best.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_38]: Best booth hands down.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hands, come on.
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't even have to say it.
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm just saying it.
[SPEAKER_38]: It's Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_38]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_38]: After all these years, 20 years I've been
involved with Cannabis Cups since 1995.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's the first time I introduced myself
to you.
[SPEAKER_38]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_38]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Keep the good work up.
[SPEAKER_38]: Keep winning contests.
[SPEAKER_38]: That's our booth right there, guys.
[SPEAKER_38]: And then here's the fam right here.
[SPEAKER_38]: This is where I just feel at home.
[SPEAKER_38]: DNAs representing.
[SPEAKER_38]: Want to see contests?
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, they've won a few.
[SPEAKER_47]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_47]: Good to see you, too, man.
[SPEAKER_47]: Hey, this is for you.
[SPEAKER_47]: DNA skateboard team.
[SPEAKER_47]: Representing, dude.
[SPEAKER_47]: We've got to get together and do some
skateboarding.
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_47]: I want to see some skateboarding.
[SPEAKER_47]: Maybe for one year.
[SPEAKER_47]: I broke my ligament.
[SPEAKER_47]: No.
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_47]: I mean, I got nights.
[SPEAKER_47]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_47]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_47]: You'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: It always comes back.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, stay tuned, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's going to be rehab.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, one year.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this is my need.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're young.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want a secret?
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Bikram yoga.
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_38]: Hot yoga.
