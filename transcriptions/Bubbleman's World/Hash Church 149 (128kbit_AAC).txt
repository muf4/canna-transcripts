[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Hash Church episode 149.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the bubble man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of been MIA for the last couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks to Dr. Natasha for holding
church down.
[SPEAKER_02]: She absolutely has been doing an
incredible job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, all of you for showing up
and watching mama holding down the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melty Heads, Jay Hendricks, thank you for
smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean8033, we got Bingo Lombardi in the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs4Days and Sal Chatino, the regulars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crew holding it down as they do every
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to send out the invitations here
real quick to the panelists and see if we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't get ourselves started on a little
Hash Church show here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely have some beautiful hash to
smoke with you all here on Hash Church
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some of what I made recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it's going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the quality easily can put
this upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shake it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can promise you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, my friend?
[SPEAKER_14]: I am well.
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got some beautiful
headstache.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sunday morning and I feel like it's
my first church in a while.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's mine, too.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't also not been around,
so I didn't I didn't even know you hadn't
[SPEAKER_02]: been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how that's how not around I've been
yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was able to escape up to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, I was in Canada this week
and over in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were in Canada in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, which is just literally like a four
to five hour stop.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: We pulled in at seven and they're like,
it's one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, well, we've seen Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how how big could Canada possibly
be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how long do you really need to see
Canada?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I got to see the Miniature Museum
and the Bug Museum and, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: in the museum district there in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking hilarious, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to give it to you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are so polite and it's such a
beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody was out taking care of their
topiaries and there's beautiful topiaries
[SPEAKER_14]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's it's it's wonderful to watch
and be part of.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I saw that it was you finished off
the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it for you, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I did all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I got to Alaska, when I was since
I was on Hash Church, the wonderful people
[SPEAKER_14]: over at Rainforest Garden, Rainforest
Farms in Juneau, Alaska invited me over to
[SPEAKER_14]: their garden.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I literally got into Alaska and went
straight to a garden.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I get home and I open up this
Cannabis Business Times, which is a
[SPEAKER_14]: magazine here in the States.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's the grow I was at in Juneau,
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so trippy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so they're all growing on LEDs up
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Fluence Lights ad.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to thank Gianno Barrett and the
wonderful people at Rainforest Farms.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was fascinating what's going on up in
Alaska compared to what's going on
[SPEAKER_14]: stateside, because I've been able to go
through other states and see what's
[SPEAKER_14]: transpiring.
[SPEAKER_14]: And sure, Alaska is very much like the
early part of California.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody is bootstrapped.
[SPEAKER_14]: No one can get any kind of money to do
whatever they need to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody has to bootstrap.
[SPEAKER_14]: From the bottom on up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone seems to be growing with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are just growing and selling
what they grow where others buy from
[SPEAKER_14]: distributors.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was interesting to see how
frustrating it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_14]: If they need to send in a sample because
they have to have everything tested to
[SPEAKER_14]: show exactly, you know, their THC CBD,
although CBD is illegal in Alaska to the
[SPEAKER_14]: dispensaries, but they're selling it in
health food stores.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the marijuana there is it's very good.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the quality that I expect yet or
of California, et cetera, that I'm used
[SPEAKER_14]: to.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're very popular with edibles
there because everybody comes in on cruise
[SPEAKER_14]: ships.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, so edibles are really high.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have a lot of.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I didn't really see any
distillates.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rainforest Farms is working on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for the most part, it's mostly just
flowers and edibles, not a lot of other
[SPEAKER_14]: ancillary products.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it costs seven hundred dollars to fly
to the laboratory, get a sample.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't matter if you have one
sample or 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: It costs you seven hundred dollars to get
it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about the testing price.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the helicopter cost.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you'd think it'd be cheaper to
send it by dog sled.
[SPEAKER_14]: But unfortunately, there's only a handful
of testers in the state of Alaska.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, they're reliant on that
reality.
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, so it was beautiful to see
everywhere we went.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody was selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: So every city we stopped in Skagway,
Juneau and Ketchikan, there were multiple
[SPEAKER_14]: retail dispensaries for 21 and older.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was fascinating to get an eye on the
scene outside of the lower 48.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm going to see what happens in
Hawaii in December because they finally
[SPEAKER_14]: open things up.
[SPEAKER_14]: But outside of the lower 48, that's all I
was been pretty much aware of.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get your mic unmuted there,
John?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to reset your whole computer,
most likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of try to reset the browser,
but you might have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B, what a character.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to spend the last seven or eight
days with Johnny B on a little trip to
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had we had a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say Tony was there as well,
as well as our Jamaican partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to visit a nice field.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to, you know, talk about the future
of products in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to actually tour Tony's lab before I
left.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got to see the whole nine yards going
on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to see at Vesa.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, and bubble man brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's part of it, Vesa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vesa and Prana and Blue River terpenes are
all all getting produced there at the Vesa
[SPEAKER_02]: lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's working, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's working, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember, keep your mic muted when
you're not talking like I'm not doing
[SPEAKER_14]: right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what was I talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my sense of you were talking about
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about no, you were
talking about Tony's lab that you went and
[SPEAKER_14]: this is Tony's lab.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, mega props.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never seen anything that is a state
of the art, a state of the art gets had to
[SPEAKER_14]: go in and immediately put booties on top
of my shoes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And everything about the place was state
of the art, top of the line.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been waiting to see something like
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was beyond proud to see, you know,
hospital grade floors and walls and things
[SPEAKER_14]: like that, which is the reality that is
needed.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, to take things to the next
level.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was very impressed by what they've
been able to bring forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, the way I say it is Tony's
no slouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's been this has been five plus
years in the making since really we met in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam and with the, you know,
with the evolution and the innovation of
[SPEAKER_02]: Prana, with the creation of Blue River
terpenes and finally the birth of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the bubble man brand actually
getting launched.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been it's been very symbiotic with
those three brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell you from my perspective, sitting up
here in Canada, being a part of it through
[SPEAKER_02]: Skype and video chats, but still not being
there, you know, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one thing to hear something and,
you know, to think about, OK, this is a
[SPEAKER_14]: possibility.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's another thing to actually walk into
that reality.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was good to see the future.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, because I hear people say it all
the time and, you know, I hear people say,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, most common thing I ever hear
is, you know, oh, my God, this is the best
[SPEAKER_14]: part you're ever going to see.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and, you know, I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every time, you know, you've heard that
bubble man, you know, once you hear that
[SPEAKER_14]: from somebody, what you're going to see is
definitely not even close to the best.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're going to ever see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was, you know, there's a kind
of a difference, too, in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial production of resin and
producing something on a on this level
[SPEAKER_02]: that is because it's going to be sold to
so many different people that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you need to really raise the bar
to protect everyone that you're selling to
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that you're selling
everything that's on par.
[SPEAKER_02]: No molds, no microbials, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing for pesticides, much like you guys
have been doing for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, you know, there's the other side
of the coin was where I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And recently being in Ontario for this
little couple of days of hash making,
[SPEAKER_02]: I made some beautiful hash a little bit
just sitting on the top of the jar there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really nice quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five star, I guess I would call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite six, but five star for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't make it in a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it in a garage with concrete floors
and with tools hanging everywhere and
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's kind of, oh, I wanted to
welcome sub cool to the room as I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: telling this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, sub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just telling everyone's got the blue
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm just talking about the
difference right now, sub between Tony's
[SPEAKER_02]: lab, the advanced Vasa lab, which is
probably what I would call the most
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting edge hashish laboratory going
right now, at least in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the flip side of that is the
beautiful thing about bubble hash and the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to make your own bubble hash is
that you can do it in your own kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't require a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can you can you can bust out the most
beautiful damn near pharma ratio quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: pharma purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninety nine point nine percent,
if not 100 percent heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did it recently in an area that,
you know, most people would be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, my God, you can't you can't make
bubble next to that or you can't do this
[SPEAKER_02]: and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's part of the thing that
we have to remember about bubble hash is
[SPEAKER_02]: that you don't require a laboratory to
make it for yourself, that you can make it
[SPEAKER_02]: in your kitchen with a little spoon and a
little bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the quality is really on par.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that it's it's kind of one
of the bonuses of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing you know, you we've known each
other a long time, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will tell everybody that's why I
mean, I'm not some pro hash maker.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never made tons of amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never sold hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: But but with your bubble bags,
I was able with a steel spoon in my
[SPEAKER_06]: kitchen and some ice to make killer
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can see my product all over
the net.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never made more than a gram or two.
[SPEAKER_06]: For you guys watching me and bubble man
had this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to press my little teeny pieces of
ash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do now know that I was pressing
water in it, by the way, and telling you
[SPEAKER_06]: publicly I was pressing a little bit of
water in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the pucks were so small, it wasn't an
issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and Waterman was pressing a lot more
or hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he used to spread it out more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of how our conversation
started.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, hey, sub, I see that you should
spread it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you forgot to mention that with
bubble bags, a stainless steel in your
[SPEAKER_02]: kitchen, you forgot the most important
part, your uber dank weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mainly just want I wanted you send me
the invitation so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to stop by and say, hey,
I actually don't I'm not going to hang out
[SPEAKER_06]: with you guys, but I didn't want to be
rude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go get donuts with my lovely
wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't want to just look at the link
and not say, you know, give you guys some
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunday love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I appreciate it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got a quiet Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch more people coming and
we're going to get into some pretty heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm always thinking about it and
figured I'd send you off the link.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always welcome to to share your
space here in Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love you, Auntie Anne.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to watch from the phone and
going to do some stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, greetings to everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, God.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give our love to Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great day, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a great one and keep doing that
voodoo that you do so well.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when I was making hash,
I wasn't doing it properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, that's when I met you,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you showed me the sifting and then
instantly started sieving and putting my
[SPEAKER_13]: hash through the colander and not making
pucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, both you and sub were in a unique
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both you and sub had great material,
but were just needed a few little tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the problem is out there is when
people are using shitty material and you
[SPEAKER_02]: give them tips and those tips don't really
result in them producing a product that is
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting and something that they actually
want to, you know, show off and share with
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the real bonus in all of this is
actually having material to use that is
[SPEAKER_02]: worthwhile using.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're cleaning up swag, it's just it's
just not going to clean up the way you
[SPEAKER_02]: want it to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Best flowers, best material makes the best
hash period, people.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't polish a turd.
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I said that just the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally said to someone you cannot
polish a turd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, people are trying to polish turds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got their turd polishing kits out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They buy those kits on Walmart.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're selling those turd polisher kits,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can add stuff to make your turd
smell better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is a problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the reality.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's something that we've seen
all the way back from when people would
[SPEAKER_14]: put in orange peels, you know,
to change the scent a little bit or,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, thinking they're doing good,
you know, but not realizing the damage
[SPEAKER_14]: they're actually doing or creating
Sporesville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I'll never forget seeing my
buddy walking up to my friend's apartment,
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing these buds hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I was like, what the fuck
is all over them?
[SPEAKER_02]: They look so weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, I sprayed them with
orange crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: He sprayed his colas with orange crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, it dries and is very sticky
and looks very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left that relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know people back in the days it was the
old Coca-Cola trick, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: sprayed down with Coca-Cola the last
couple of days before you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It dried up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked like it had crystals on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be stickier than hell.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just look at the weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It sticks to the wall.
[SPEAKER_13]: And hey, that was the late 80s,
early 90s that I recall.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they still do it that way.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's when I was originally buying and
selling weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mexican that I got was all compressed
with Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was brown.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you actually would break open that
quarter pound, you'd see the sugar stains
[SPEAKER_14]: on the inside.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it was absolutely dumbfounding,
but that's just that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the easiest way to grow crystals
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the easiest way to grow
crystals.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's not.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm saying that's what people are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to welcome Mr. Skunk Man Sam
to the room, Dr. Natasha to the room and
[SPEAKER_02]: the lovely Sarah Sunday to the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: And good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to have you all here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on in the good world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know Sarah, I invited Sarah today
because we are closing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting closer and closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be a month, a month and a week
or something away from the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a local cup that we have here in
Canada that Sarah's been putting on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, I want to say for the last four
years, am I correct?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the fourth year, the fourth
annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at where you are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could only see your avatar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't opened up your camera,
but when you spoke, it went full screen
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, holy smokes, that is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can just picture a big stage in the back
behind you and a big massive concert just
[SPEAKER_13]: pounding.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have 50 acres here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, the best part about that property,
the best part of that property is that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nobody on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best part of that property.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't be so stressed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never have a party here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be like the biggest security risk
ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know growers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't ever let anybody come to your
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Having a lot of people knowing where I am,
that would be, I would never sleep again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea of you having a big stage and
a party at your property, I could just
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine you'd just be ruined.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it wouldn't be working for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do as big as I have it now and no
bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like the length of the,
my stress level would be too high.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuckin' right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for coming in in such a
beautiful environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about yourself, Natasha?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch the fireworks last night
with the crew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, had a nice evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had a nice evening out in
Vancouver last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went to check out the fireworks show with
Kristen and Tyler and yeah, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a nice patio from their
apartment and kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't have to get up in all the
crowds or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could watch from afar.
[SPEAKER_01]: My preferred fireworks watching venue,
but yeah, it was Team Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put on a good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a nice night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kind of hermity writing and
staying in my apartment lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was nice to check out the city and.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but the end of that fireworks
display last night, wasn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I was right on the beach and kids and
it was just, I mean the lights,
[SPEAKER_13]: the sky, just lit right up.
[SPEAKER_13]: And for Vancouver to be so beautiful,
I was staring right at the barge.
[SPEAKER_13]: And wow, it was a, it was really good to
see they have one August 2nd, August 3rd,
[SPEAKER_13]: I think too.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I didn't see it on there with all the
a hundred thousand people down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally a different experience when
you're up on the beach, right under the
[SPEAKER_01]: fireworks, which I've also experienced is
I did that a few years ago in Vancouver
[SPEAKER_01]: and lightning and thunderstorms are very
rare here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there happened to be this epic
lightning storm going on while the
[SPEAKER_01]: fireworks were going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that was very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a nice show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also being out on the boat is always one
of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting out on the boat and being like
almost next to the barge is a really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really beautiful spot to see those
fireworks from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had that experience yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have to do that for the next
fireworks show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably maybe drive the boat out
to kids, drop it in the water there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we could go out on the boat and
watch that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to drive my boat three hours
from where I live all the way around the
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain to get to, which is scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to get home, take about three plus
hours in the pitch black, driving like two
[SPEAKER_02]: kilometers an hour, looking for logs and
other things in the water.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll come with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome D420K in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like I haven't seen you forever,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been traveling.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been, we had the last, the last show
I was on was before the ladies took over
[SPEAKER_12]: the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to say that was an incredible show
too, Natasha.
[SPEAKER_12]: Way to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like kudos to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, mega kudos.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, of course let's do a bong
rip, you mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a bong rip and then we'll have
Sarah give us the low down on what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on with the Karma Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a great time at the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people ask me, you know,
oh, there's so many different events.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, for me, I'll give you a
view of my perspective, not as a person
[SPEAKER_02]: who's going to the event to see the
booths, to, to see the bands, to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't go for any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a businessman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to expose my company to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can say this, that out of all the
shows I do, I do really well at the Karma
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup, not just for business, but for
interactions with people who have come
[SPEAKER_02]: from all over Ontario, Canada,
and the U S to actually come see me or to
[SPEAKER_02]: see John or to see whoever else is at this
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I really feel that the Karma Cup is
a success for that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the larger, bigger sort of
conferences that are, I guess a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more, you know, less smoking and more
conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really do very well at those
conferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really do much business,
but at the Karma Cup, it's business like
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a business perspective,
which is, I think my most accurate
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective that I can give you,
it's a great event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth having a booth and it's worth
going down there and getting some
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you say, Sarah, you want to
tell us a little bit about this year's
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, totally, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, first off, it's September 9th and
10th in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two days over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the weekend after Labor Day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: My joint was just delivered to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to send a text.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, did you get me my joint?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Josh is the man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he is.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So September 9th and 10th in Toronto,
it's an expo.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got speakers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for instance, right now, just the
other day, we had the in-person entry date
[SPEAKER_07]: and got all the entries in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like there's going to be over a
hundred again this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could still use more, but, and
concentrate though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have, but, or concentrates and
you want to enter, hit me up and I'll give
[SPEAKER_07]: you another week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's like 200 grams, approximately,
a bud and 32 grams of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll deal with the details.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to hit me up, Sarah at the
KarmaCup.com or like on any of the social,
[SPEAKER_07]: basically, I'll read your DM and we can
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got the most ridiculous quantity of
edibles this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: people are just going crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool to see the mature
marketplace that we've developed and how
[SPEAKER_07]: many new companies are out there and how
many people are excited about the industry
[SPEAKER_07]: and trying to innovate and bring good
products to the public.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hope that in our new legalization
framework that all these new companies
[SPEAKER_07]: really get a chance to demonstrate their
knowledge that they've acquired over years
[SPEAKER_07]: of experience in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would really be a shame if all this
industry knowledge is not taken advantage
[SPEAKER_07]: of.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm almost sold out of booths.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got like zero small booths and I've
got like maybe under five big booths left.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want a booth like I would get on
it Monday or Tuesday because I would
[SPEAKER_07]: expect them to be done by Thursday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a ton of sponsors right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got
[SPEAKER_07]: Diamond, Fido, High North.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a list.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was more prepared for my last interview
because I had a bit more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see who else I got here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sponsor and vendor info.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the beauty of Google Sheets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I use them all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Google Docs and Sheets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what's happening now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loading.
Loading.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, where is me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Load faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we can do a bong rip while it's
loading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, do a bong rip, please.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Johnny, when are you getting a
haircut, scruff dog?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yo, it's the new Ed Sheeran look.
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to his concert last night.
[SPEAKER_13]: I signed some signatures.
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, I'm an Ed Sheeran lookalike.
[SPEAKER_13]: People thought it might be like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: I was even in Edmonton and we were sitting
at a bar.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was with Drew from Boveda and I was with
Helena.
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody came up and bought us some
drinks.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was like, he wants to buy a drink.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the fun in life, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep growing it, Ben.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's doing good for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just letting it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked out really good for you at
Customs when you came back from Toronto,
[SPEAKER_02]: that hair, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually got pulled in and they went
through all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: The guy said I looked interesting and he
wanted to talk to somebody.
[SPEAKER_13]: But said it was an experience and got out
of there nicely and then hung out with
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, went and saw him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, missed his flight, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say next time, comb your
hair over next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, the Customs guys,
they pick anything they can to cause us
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: This kid was like 20 years old and he said
he wanted to do his job.
[SPEAKER_13]: He finds people he likes to talk to.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what he told me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you look like someone interesting to
talk to.
[SPEAKER_13]: I educated him all on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them what you said when you got to
Customs and he said, what were you doing
[SPEAKER_02]: in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_13]: I was educating doctors on how to describe
cannabis to patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was training doctors, he says,
with his hair standing out like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy's like, I'll talk to you over
there, please.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what went on.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to have a session and I ordered you
some pizza.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a pizza.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was three days to get to Jamaica in
February.
[SPEAKER_13]: This time, it took me three days to get
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true because John couldn't leave
from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Jamaica, we dropped him off at three
o'clock in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 10.30 at night, he texts me and says,
I am still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My flight never left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's rioting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The army and the police are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are throwing up and having heart
attacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ambulance is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went and saved him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went and picked him up and got him and
he stayed with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we were like, all right, we'll go to
Toronto together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was staying in Toronto to make some
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: John was going to continue on to
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made him miss his flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I was stoked though, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to puff a nice little session that
night.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then because of the screw up and the whole
thing, and yes, it was a Jerry Springer at
[SPEAKER_13]: the airport in Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was people arrested.
[SPEAKER_13]: People were puking.
[SPEAKER_13]: I put on my face, people were rioting.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then they shoved everybody on a plane the
next day.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, yeah, I'm not going over those
things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Needless to say, we all made it home
nicely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Things went fantastic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamaica was amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots to talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need Tony to be on here to talk
more about what's going on in Jamaica and
[SPEAKER_13]: for the world because it's pretty good
stuff going on, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure he'll be on a little later
on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been touring around some people and
pretty busy the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know yesterday I watched him on Google
Chat filling up the first bubble man pen
[SPEAKER_02]: with, I think it was strawberry banana
goo, as well as the 30% terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll hear a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to Andrew D'Angelo's birthday
party last night to hit everyone up with
[SPEAKER_02]: the new pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he hit that pen on the camera,
he literally blew right out of the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was sideways.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hit it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he coughed and blew backwards out of
the camera view.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the pen has been designed to
really rip like a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want these little puffy,
light ... But also designed to give a
[SPEAKER_13]: standardized dose.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the biggest thing that we were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, oh, it's what he was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get a dose every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, the standardized dose is
actually the other unit that he was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about with the Teflon mesh,
not our pen at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a different unit, but also very
cool, nebulizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_12]: Long rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: You ready, Sarah?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: I unmute you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it to you as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know plugging is terribly banal,
but got to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: These people are helping me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've enabled us to basically make the
event happen, so I thank everybody very
[SPEAKER_07]: much.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is basically an order of alpha,
because that's how I have them listed.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Squad and Vapor Central Platinum.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of sponsors.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're helping me out, giving me money
and things to make the event happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everybody, if you can go out and
support those guys, I would truly
[SPEAKER_07]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, you're coming too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're coming too, right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be there 100% supporting in any way
that I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to shout out Jordan of the
Islands as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me a big huge seed collection here
recently, his entire catalog, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give thanks, Jordan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get those cracked and I'll give them
to everyone I know, because that's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give away genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if any of you have a problem with it,
maybe suck a bag of dicks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for the watermelon by way
of John last year, two years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: whenever it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: The watermelon does well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's beautiful the way she grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: The calyxes stacked on top of calyxes,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Very bumpy looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets red too.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you let it go and it's cold,
oh my God, it gets this crazy red ruby
[SPEAKER_07]: color.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really beautiful plant and stinky.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's a fan favorite,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, shout out to Subcool,
because that was done under his banner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a TGA genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Astro Boy was done as an accident,
I guess, Bad Boy was taking care of the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow for Sub while he was potentially,
I think he might've been in jail at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bad Boy didn't realize this male,
and I can't remember if it was an Apollo
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 or an Ortega or something, but it ended
up- I think it was Apollo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ortega.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two, we used to have a lot back
then, especially in Winnipeg, where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: from, and this is where the grow was,
and this has happened to be where Sub was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, yeah, it was just all kind of
unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll never forget my friend,
in my living room, giving that cut to my
[SPEAKER_02]: mentor, Ron Hickey, and Ron kind of being
like, oh, this wasn't the one I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you promised me another one,
and now you're not giving it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was really kind of a little bit upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect what he was upset about,
but it was less than three months later
[SPEAKER_02]: that that tune changed, and he's just been
praising the Astro Boy ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoy it heavily.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys for sharing genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it's very important to share
genetics, because I recently had an
[SPEAKER_07]: incident where I came back from a trip,
and a couple of my mothers had died
[SPEAKER_07]: because somebody hadn't actually gotten
them water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was all super bummed out,
and it was one of my favorite plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'd given it away, so I'm able to get
it back.
Woo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the way to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you share the genetics- I saw someone
post recently this beautiful spear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably like a two and a half foot
long just spear, a beautiful purple bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: greenish purple bud covered in resin,
like white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy was all happy because he had
given it away a bunch of times,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was able to get it back because he
was giving it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty simple thing, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't understand it, if you hoard
something and then you kill it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will be gone, and you will be the
person to blame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard words to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcus, you mentioned that you were giving
away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know I patented that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you give away free seeds,
you actually have to pay me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, listen to this, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only did I know that, the free seeds
I'm giving away are yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've got it patented.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've got it patented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you always said, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's when we share information,
our knowledge, and what we do here every
[SPEAKER_13]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_13]: We share.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the level that we're at,
I'm not talking about Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go take his 40 years of work, of his
registered cultivar, and go peel it off
[SPEAKER_02]: and share it with the entire world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: When there's a business, when you've
invested millions of dollars and you've
[SPEAKER_02]: paid PhDs to do work for you, and you have
laboratories and greenhouses and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things, well, okay, now we're
entering a different world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, of course, that person,
those people who have done that work
[SPEAKER_02]: should be paid for their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should get something out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just talking about cultivars that are
all on this level of being able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you can buy it, well, I can share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can get it, I can share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with giving away free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I strongly believe in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure you've probably given away
more seeds than anyone I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine the kilos and kilos and
kilos of seeds that have left your hands
[SPEAKER_02]: to go to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've even taken it upon yourself to
collect other seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget being at Sam's house,
and he started pulling these giant fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds out, literally like this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, he had one on his couch one
time, and people thought it was one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those pillows you sit on when you have
had- It was that coco de mer seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: that in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coco de meres.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an unbelievable thing to get that put
in your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, here, check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what, you've shipped one of
these back from the Seychelles or wherever
[SPEAKER_02]: you were?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, no, I shipped a trunk load
of them back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just appreciate Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_14]: We think bag loads are just a stash loads.
[SPEAKER_14]: He thinks trunk loads, and that's
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep in mind, a trunk load of these
seeds was probably 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're huge fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they fall on you, they can kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does, what does it weigh,
like a kilo or something?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's more like 40 kilos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy, like when it's full of water and
fresh?
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's full of water and it still has a
husk on it, because what you saw was
[SPEAKER_05]: dehusk, just like a coconut is dehusk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess, Natasha, are we going to have
Adrian come in today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he should be coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He texted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he'd be about 15 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said he'll be on and yeah,
we'll talk about his new study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Kevin was in a situation that he
wasn't sure if he'd be able to.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, what did he say?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on, he's on Block Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bandwidth might be crummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but he said Adrian and Siren would
make great guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adrian will do an awesome job and Chimera
may join.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said Chimera, the link as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the new, new, new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll, we'll wait to talk about it till
he pops on, but that'll be soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you get to see Ed and Jane last
night?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I never did end up connecting with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think they're here till the
Wednesday show also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we'll get them, uh, get together
for a little puff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to mention something new,
new, new that's happening up here in
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada that was going to be announced.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just was announced.
[SPEAKER_13]: High Times is going to be having a
cannabis cup in Canada, August 25th to
[SPEAKER_13]: 27th.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it has taken over the Legends Valley
Music Festival and Biocup and it'll be
[SPEAKER_13]: officially announced yesterday.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was announced, but it'll be released on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_13]: But High Times is doing cannabis cup here
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be happening in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, three weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's happening August 25th to 27th.
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be at the Legends Valley Music
Festival at the ranch.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, I think they're announcing,
uh, that, uh, Tragic and Hip is going to
[SPEAKER_13]: be playing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see that, uh, High Times is also
preparing to go public?
[SPEAKER_14]: On the stock market.
[SPEAKER_13]: I never saw that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's, that's coming down the pike.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, uh, if people don't know, High Times
was recently sold to a new group,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, with, with a whole bunch of different
people and, uh, a lot of people that I
[SPEAKER_14]: know that are good people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, hopefully they'll change,
uh, some of the direction of the magazine,
[SPEAKER_14]: the cups of, of really going in their own
direction.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but, uh, yeah, apparently,
uh, they're putting together to make a
[SPEAKER_14]: public offering and it'll be available on
the stock market.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the actual, uh,
calling letters are, but I thought that
[SPEAKER_14]: was an interesting move considering the,
you know, legality and how things are
[SPEAKER_14]: becoming more normalized.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you guys saw, but Sunset
magazine, which is a very normal magazine
[SPEAKER_14]: for your predominant home person or garden
person came out with an article on how to
[SPEAKER_14]: grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, how to grow your cannabis outdoor
because it's now legal on the entire West
[SPEAKER_14]: coast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now people can grow their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're owned in certain States.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the normal magazines are starting to
go, okay, well now we can talk about this
[SPEAKER_14]: because this is now part of, you know,
adult life over 21 that, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: you need to know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sunset.
[SPEAKER_14]: It really blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I've been to their actual,
uh, they have, uh, festivals over here in,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, San Jose.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, it's very pomp, very,
you know, it's, it's all the, the regular,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, people who sell all the things for
your home sponsor it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking everything from solar panels
to the nails, to the screws, to the
[SPEAKER_14]: hammers, electronic cameras, all that sort
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's fascinating to see the normalcy
spreading into the media in a way that we
[SPEAKER_14]: have never had exposure where high times
is the only way you could get grow
[SPEAKER_14]: information back in the day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell Mark Emery even had to do it,
you know, constitutionally up there in
[SPEAKER_14]: Canada to sell high times because you
know, your government wouldn't even allow
[SPEAKER_14]: high times for a time being, you know,
so I think it's kudos that they're now
[SPEAKER_14]: going to have a, uh, cannabis cup finally
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's fitting and it shows to,
uh, uh, the steadfastness of the Canadian,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, not give up and you go out from
not even having the magazine to getting
[SPEAKER_14]: ready to have a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: So outstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it'll be interesting to see how much
sort of traction they can build in three
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not go to the bio cup last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my friends go and say it was,
it was fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, I have to pick and choose,
you know, really carefully with my
[SPEAKER_02]: products because not all the events I go
to, uh, end up being worthwhile for me
[SPEAKER_02]: business wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when it comes to high times,
they've always been able to bring people,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's with usually like three to six
months of advance of being able to like
[SPEAKER_02]: promote and get the event going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't be going to the high times
cannabis cup this year, but I know my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends will, and I'm sure we'll get an
update on whether or not they pulled it
[SPEAKER_02]: off with bringing the, the, the people
that need to come when you actually have a
[SPEAKER_02]: high times event that to me tells me that
thousands of people are going to come for
[SPEAKER_02]: four to 5,000 minimum, maybe 10,000.
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be more with the events that will
be, well, we've got some headline as we
[SPEAKER_13]: enlisted on Monday and the new headline is
coming up and high times has taken over
[SPEAKER_13]: the event because the event was a 10 year
event.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they've taken over the next eight
years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it would definitely be, um,
uh, a big event.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll happen every year for the next eight
years at the grizzly farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, ranch, I should say, and, uh,
and, uh, on the Island, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope everybody can make it out this
year, but, uh, it's all taken over.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on the website.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're interested in tickets,
just go to cannabis cup.com, click on the
[SPEAKER_13]: link, Canada, they have Detroit and Spain
out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, there you guys go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope to see you all come up for the
first, uh, high times cannabis cup here in
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be, uh, you know,
first from, I heard it might be the second
[SPEAKER_13]: one.
[SPEAKER_13]: They sponsored one years ago, apparently,
but, um, in my opinion, this is the first
[SPEAKER_13]: time the first one that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, it's pretty cool to see it happen
up here, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like dabs has crashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, he's the way he's looking.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was about to say, it looks like dad was
out, but boy, dad's is grown.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, fishing on my pontoon boat with and
seeing if she could handle it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she is a trooper, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: She loves fishing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I caught a fish last night.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she was just like, she was like,
what the hell is that coming out of the
[SPEAKER_12]: water?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's, uh, he's quite the little adventure
doggy.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's not scared of much.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and nice and chill here on hashtags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to puff more bowls until
more conversation comes to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So new book found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the scratch and sniff weed book.
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you seen, have you guys seen this?
[SPEAKER_12]: No.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So cool to send it across the border.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually got it in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, one of the, I got at this actually at
Giano shop there at rainforest farms.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got cute little illustrations and,
uh, they've got little scent stickers so
[SPEAKER_14]: you can actually scratch and, uh,
sniff them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, yeah, things smell like,
uh, a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: The cannabis still doesn't smell a lot,
but it's got like a little mango so you
[SPEAKER_14]: can smell the mango and lemon and pining.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it explains some of the, you know,
karyophylline, lemonine, linalool,
[SPEAKER_14]: myrcine.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it breaks down terpenes for people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's the first, uh, that I've seen of a
breakdown that's very simplistic,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, for people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it goes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I literally, I got it at the, uh,
at the shop there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, uh, it's Abrams image, uh,
Abrams image.com and it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: the scratch and sniff book of weed by Seth
Matlins and Eve Epstein illustrated by
[SPEAKER_14]: Anne Picard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it smell like Terps?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have some, you know, that you could
definitely tell like, here's here's maple
[SPEAKER_14]: syrup and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there cannabis Terps in there?
[SPEAKER_14]: It says so, but they don't smell right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, cause Tony has that technology to
make scratch and sniff cards and stickers
[SPEAKER_02]: with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smelt the Tangy business card.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: A Dana Larson scratch and sniff cartoon
book all with weed cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for showing that book.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's needed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, uh, if there, if there is one
thing that's needed is it's an identifier
[SPEAKER_14]: for these genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a bad enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got some of these funny ass names
for these things, but it's one thing to
[SPEAKER_14]: know the name.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's another thing to actually have the
phenotype set in a sense so that we could
[SPEAKER_14]: actually drop and smell.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that people could acclimate and I
could then educate my bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can educate them better, the patients
and the public, because then they know
[SPEAKER_14]: what they have, what they're looking for,
what they have access to.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had to learn that from, you know,
our oral or analeptic testing or for me,
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been, I've seen, you know,
I've seen tons and tons of cannabis over
[SPEAKER_14]: the decades.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've been fortunate to understand and
get my own knowledge and understanding
[SPEAKER_14]: like each and every one of us on here have
for certain genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: But with the new market coming on,
there needs to be better education.
[SPEAKER_14]: Education tools that we can take forward
to the public so that they can absorb so
[SPEAKER_14]: that they can kind of catch up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we are at the tip of the spear,
all of us here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're, I mean, some of us have been the
tip of the spears for, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: four plus decades, Sam, you know,
so, uh, but it's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's another step to educate the masses is
we have to reach out beyond us.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to reach beyond the knowledge,
you know, stop preaching to the converted,
[SPEAKER_14]: get out there and introduce yourself to
somebody and challenge yourself to your
[SPEAKER_14]: own communication abilities and
communicate and do your best to stand
[SPEAKER_14]: steadfast to the challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would only add that I think Sam might be
the wind in front of the spear as you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just off the spear.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm concerned about a little bit is
the way some of the extract companies will
[SPEAKER_05]: extract THC and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then recombine them at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what the recombining is only five or
10 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the entire suite of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you analyze an average plant,
you can find 50, 60 terpenes pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look, but most people don't look.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seems like a great form of education
though, for the people that don't have the
[SPEAKER_12]: education on just the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like that's, that was pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty interested in learning about
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, doctors need this education.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, not only they need to know about
this cannabis, they need to know the
[SPEAKER_14]: different ranges and understand even about
terpenes, you know, cause some doctors do,
[SPEAKER_14]: but they're mostly the holistic or those
that are in the naturopath world.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not necessarily those of the
regular doctor world, no offense,
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Natasha or any other doctors out
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, it's not taught as we,
as you know, doctors not taught in,
[SPEAKER_14]: in, in school.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've had to become your own researcher
and you know, find, you know, become your
[SPEAKER_14]: own arrow tip and actually go down that
path, you know, and we've all had to
[SPEAKER_14]: become not only leaders, but trailblazers
because you know, a lot of us have seen
[SPEAKER_14]: trails, but that trail doesn't go the
direction that we want.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to go this other direction.
[SPEAKER_14]: We see that trail and we respect that
trail for where it's done, but however
[SPEAKER_14]: it's, it's not our trail.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we have to find our own path.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so as we're pushing forward and as
we're educating ourselves, we have to
[SPEAKER_14]: realize that, as we're educated,
we have to educate, you know, thousands,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, I don't want to say it's a
hierarchy, but if you look at it like a
[SPEAKER_14]: hierarchy, then a thousand below us is
kind of like that pyramid scheme.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to educate all these people now
that we come into contact or interaction
[SPEAKER_14]: with.
[SPEAKER_14]: So any type of education tool that we can
simplify the process.
[SPEAKER_14]: So by being sent, you know, olfactory
regions is so exponentially we're tied to.
[SPEAKER_14]: I learned that firsthand after I lost my
sense of smell for 10 years after the war.
[SPEAKER_14]: Until it came back on the dog's fart,
but still, you know, boom, terpenes kicked
[SPEAKER_14]: back in my nose and you know, fart terps.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fart terps be as ugly as it was,
you know, boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would have tried beaver terps probably
five years earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we can put together for people
who have lost their sense of smells.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beaver terps sent rescuers.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about preaching to the choir
on this last trip to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky enough to speak to a room full
of doctors at an event that was put on to
[SPEAKER_02]: educate doctors in Jamaica in regards to
prescribing of different medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some products registered recently
with the minister of health department.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we needed to educate doctors in
regards to, you know, first, I guess it
[SPEAKER_02]: was really mainly Tony who obviously came
up with Prana and he was explaining the
[SPEAKER_02]: United cannabis company, but I got to be
on stage and talk about sort of trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: glandular trichome where the resin is
produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony literally just started talking about
standing up on stage in Mo Bay in regards
[SPEAKER_02]: to educating doctors and just was able to
kind of give them a little bit of a short
[SPEAKER_02]: overview of what the glandular trichome
is, how the medicine synthesized inside
[SPEAKER_02]: the head, how we extract and isolate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Tony translated that into the
medicine, into Prana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the resin lesson, Tony went up and
then spoke about Prana and it was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome to see because before we spoke,
it was a lot of people speaking about drug
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction and sort of like a lower level
of knowledge of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say that Dr. Lorenzo
Gordon absolutely blew me away with his,
[SPEAKER_02]: what he did with his slides and whatnot,
the information that he shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you not agree, Tony, that that was
some of the deepest science that you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: ever heard about cannabis and the THC and
all the different molecules?
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed, agreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went deep and explained how the brain
synopsis and receptor work responded to
[SPEAKER_03]: different cannabinoids and ratios and
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the room, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning, Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a little bit shut this morning?
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a birthday party last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of, a lot of extract smoke
there, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to smoke some extracts right
now, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of this five star bubble hash
that I made just a few days ago in
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto.
[SPEAKER_12]: Vsod, everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Going for Bratki with the found.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, D.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good day, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Enjoy, be safe out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I'm going to bong rip with you
on the way out, so.
[SPEAKER_12]: Might as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, might as well join you on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I might as well join you too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Tony, it's good to see you,
sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've told the bubble man earlier about the
trip to your beautiful and wonderful state
[SPEAKER_14]: of the art laboratory.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hadn't got to connect with you since
then.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he went to Jamaica and I went to
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was Alaska.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazeballs.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's cannabis everywhere,
but it's like, it's about, it's like 1996.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's still clawing, you know,
no one can get any type of investors or,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, so everybody's bootstrapping.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no bank will give anybody a loan.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I said earlier, it costs $700 to
fly any sample to the lab to get it
[SPEAKER_14]: tested.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have to let it stack up a bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all that affects price, you know,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's, it's still reasonable.
[SPEAKER_14]: Edibles are the most popular thing there.
[SPEAKER_14]: They need bubble man tech there,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do not have full melt.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do not have any of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, concentrates are lacking
and they're working on it, but it's very
[SPEAKER_14]: difficult with these, you know,
the system there that they have in place,
[SPEAKER_14]: as well as then you insert Alaska weather
and, you know, you can see how the comedy
[SPEAKER_14]: can ensue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this kosher Kush is absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice to have a variety of, you know,
fresh Hatties, if you will.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're the best ones, in my opinion,
the fresh ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fresh Hatties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this material was, was,
was cured and dried properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of asked him that he did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, should I leave it fresh
frozen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why don't you dry it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll give, I think when you're
learning about bubble hash, it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: important to learn first with dry
material, use dry material, dry material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's no cheating involved,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_02]: wax membranes filled with moisture that
appear to be melty on the first few days
[SPEAKER_02]: of fresh bubble hash being made can often
dry out, evaporate and leave a buttered
[SPEAKER_02]: out non melty finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's sort of where,
you know, fresh frozen people love the
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh frozen because A, it's going to
preserve those very caustic terpenes that
[SPEAKER_02]: we would otherwise evaporate out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good conversation with my friend
Zach in Ontario, who's just 25 years old,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years younger than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just says, yeah, the young people,
they, they want all those as live as
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, those are kind of like
terpenes that for what we did for years
[SPEAKER_02]: was we allowed those to evaporate out
because they were so rough and caustic and
[SPEAKER_02]: harsh on our throats that now you have
this product that everyone's smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this, it's just gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grabs you so harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite different from, you know,
20 years ago, smoking something that was
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely perfectly cured before the hash
was even made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the hash, when you make it is perfectly
cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you say that there's a big
difference in those two things,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, yes, for both the reasons you
mentioned, both for taste and smell and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and combustibility and also the moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't want any moisture trapped.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to get it out one way or another.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand the reason why people
like elevated terpene levels from live
[SPEAKER_05]: resin, but they need a way to get it bone
dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: People, I guess, use evaporator ovens or
even really low temperature freeze dryers
[SPEAKER_05]: or some sort of something because the
stuff feels just like a dry powder when I
[SPEAKER_05]: touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sounds like a freeze dryer,
some type of evaporated unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's pretty amazing whether it's
fresh or dry sifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got to get the variety you like
the best and bingo.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely something to be said
for how it ignites.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you actually go to dab it or hit it,
when it doesn't have that tiny little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of moisture, it just seems to be like
poof.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, THC and most of the terpenes are
pretty darn flammable basically,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're extremely volatile.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you catch the volatile part of it
on fire, then it sort of looks like a
[SPEAKER_05]: flammable, but we've seen it in Afghan
Hubbly Bubbies with a flame two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're standing next to the Hubbly
Bubbly and you're getting a tan on the
[SPEAKER_02]: side of your face because a flame is
shooting up out of the top of the thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's only when you put your resin in,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's obviously wasting some
cannabinoids and terpenes, but it's also
[SPEAKER_05]: the way to get the biggest air intake of
vaporized cannabis products that's
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else is quite like an Afghan
Hubbly Bubbly water pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing like it at all that I've
ever come across personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: By far, it's the top, top, top for most
absolute ripped you can get from a bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's what could possibly,
okay, maybe my glass, ham, gallon of water
[SPEAKER_02]: gravity bong is a close second,
but by close, I mean like a kilometer and
[SPEAKER_02]: a half.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Hubbly Bubblies in the real deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people are saying, oh, but that pipe,
it's going to get me too stoned or it's
[SPEAKER_05]: too much smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why it's designed that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to hit on it and then take a big
hit and the purpose is to get you too
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's therapeutic for certain and I can
only imagine the amount of people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: history of time that hit that pipe and
then had to go lay down on pillows or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe right there on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed to get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we come out of prohibition,
as the straightest of the straights,
[SPEAKER_02]: the most conservative Christian,
just like the straightiest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: straights, as they come to be
unbrainwashed with their children and
[SPEAKER_02]: their loved ones using cannabis as a
medicine, I suspect that it's still going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take a while, but at one point in time,
we'll really be able to be proud and not
[SPEAKER_02]: ashamed to use cannabis for elevation,
to call it getting high, to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting high and it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be associated with like,
I just ate a bunch of pharma drugs and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all propaganda.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we mean by high is an elevated state
of mind, just a really elevated state of
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, one that is soothing to the five
cents prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: This that we are currently all locked in
because if you consider that there's only
[SPEAKER_02]: a small amount of space on the graph of
what it can be seen or what can be heard,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't hear everything that can be
heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a very small piece of the pie and
that's in regards to all our senses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to have a plant like cannabis
to be able to elevate, relax ourselves and
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of soothe these senses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrous, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense taken, Drew Robertson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat's ripping along as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a whole bunch of people in there that
have been in probably since this morning
[SPEAKER_02]: when I started the link.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do apologize for starting the link so
late today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually start it a day or two early and
I didn't start it till this morning at 7 a
[SPEAKER_02]: .m.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry for those people that were
probably looking and thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh-oh, maybe there's no hash church today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that freak people out after 149
weeks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys realize we're like a couple of
months away from three years of doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: show every Sunday?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should either have an invisible
or a silent hash church.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be the third year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just, no one will show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll open it, but they're just,
I'll put, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the third year anniversary,
I insist that we all use dolls as our
[SPEAKER_02]: avatar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So start looking now for the doll that
you're going to use, the little doll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone gets to pick one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got mine already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got yours already, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then Sam has to show his face for that
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, Sam's not allowed to use a
doll.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will use a doll with my face on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's make a 3D You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get these crazy 3D sculptures of
your face and your body if you,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh man, that would be funny for someone to
show up with one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just printed my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably at the end of the show he'll be
like, probably you guys didn't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: this, but my new 3D hash-making machine
uses hash as the main substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to dab my head now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll just pick his head right up off
the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop it into the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to do that, Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a simple resin block that goes
into a polynamorous printer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get this bubble man thing
charged that I used last night at the
[SPEAKER_03]: party.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to head off at how funny you looked
when you took your first dab on that
[SPEAKER_02]: wheelchair because you literally pushed
yourself as you coughed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a cartoon, how much smoke
you blew out of your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, would you fill that thing with
glycol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Glycerin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Sam's already patented that,
Dank Runner says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patented what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how awesome Sarah's background is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of patented anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a novel and unique idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go grab another battery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Mark, I just wanted to show you,
I got handed my new poster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did that?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my friend Chris Perez, FTF Media.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in Riverside now in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really windy here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's just an awesome artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's what I'm going to be putting
in the newspapers and on the telephone
[SPEAKER_07]: poles and all over campuses and various
places starting on Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have all my sponsors here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have tickets.
[SPEAKER_07]: My last pluggy plug, I swear.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have general admission tickets.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are various lounges and outlets.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a list on the website.
[SPEAKER_07]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, glad you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what doing it right is all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole point is to bring as many people
as possible with a like line together and
[SPEAKER_07]: give these awesome new companies that are
starting up promotion and make them some
[SPEAKER_07]: money.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's like my whole goal is to push it
as hard as I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are all the samples tested for pesticides?
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, make sure it's always important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good, good, good thing to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, testing is so bunk in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've done it now a lot and it's
garbage basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every lab is crappy.
[SPEAKER_07]: They never get me the test when they say
they're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not true that all labs are garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some labs are garbage, but certainly
not all labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lab for 30 years and it absolutely
was not garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you had you in the lab and like
Dave paid and like epic, like top,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the upper echelon of like Canada is
hurting, I will admit, for labs and we
[SPEAKER_02]: need some good labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Anandio Labs is doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Page's group at UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're still not there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them won't test for me because
it's by the nature of the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, they don't want to do my testing
because they're licensed dealers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's another issue that we have here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this time I'm using high north labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They promised me they're going to get it
to me and it's going to be done and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be another, I find whenever I,
and I obviously this is probably not an
[SPEAKER_02]: option for like cannabis cups and stuff,
but whenever I have sent things to a lab
[SPEAKER_02]: to test it, um, you know, and I'm not
testing like 50 things at a time by any
[SPEAKER_02]: means, but when I send things to a lab to
test them, I send them to like two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three labs, redundancy for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I know that's not going to be an
option for the cannabis world,
[SPEAKER_02]: but so expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I'm having something,
you know, when Indra is extracting oil and
[SPEAKER_02]: defatting oil from a protein powder
isolate of hemp, I don't want a single lab
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell me the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got three different labs to tell me
the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that, you definitely see variation
that does not put your heart at ease when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like that shit was the same sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, what were they doing that it
all came back different?
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, Marcus, you can start by
just looking at the protocol that they use
[SPEAKER_05]: for a GC FID for terpenes or HPLC for,
uh, uh, if their methodology isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: correct, then it's probably not
reproducible either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragonfly medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit you up all last.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit you up all last minute while you're
like trimming up a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you want to come do hash church?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Sarah's like in bed with no clothes
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me get dressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get dressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just, uh, Oh, we're talking about
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about, uh, you know,
the things that we seem to talk about over
[SPEAKER_02]: and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it just be great if there was two
different sort of areas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you, if you grow with pesticides
while you kind of have to be over in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, and if you grow without them,
you're in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the lab testing is just,
we need to bring the cost of lab testing
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we need to bring the cost of what's
in that pen down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks ridiculous.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_14]: Liquid gold.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are those available now, Tony?
[SPEAKER_14]: You said they were going to be around July
or August 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are coming along.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the first ones that got out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got to, you got to test them
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying you want to be a tester?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not afraid of testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'll tell you what's interesting about
it was kind of last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got some good reaction is it's a tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: So see how the solution is thicker on the
top and then it goes into a section right
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's thinner, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's reusable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could open up this top over here
and refill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's why it doesn't burn out the
flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause of those separations, you're only
hitting what goes into the bottom chamber
[SPEAKER_02]: and you only get a little bit in there at
a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority stays up at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe I will never hear the same
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you enjoy that Natasha?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you didn't see that on the all female
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think guys are just naturally more
obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it, but, uh, I think we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were so pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, I watched in awe at the
women.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even now I'm like, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to not talk over people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to not be loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to not say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to say the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean you don't know how to be polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But wouldn't it be a real drag if we were
all women or all men?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the, uh, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm also a big fan of the yin and the
yang, but being the side that I'm on,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was very, I just, I really appreciated
that panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just fill that up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, I mean, I just take this
little, the applicators that we had before
[SPEAKER_03]: you put it right in between the two little
stoppers and, uh, fill it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Lord, that looks surreal, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like three little gold drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone else see what I see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little air bubbles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome Adrian.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just geeking out on resin,
getting filled into a pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're just on mute, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to geek out on a whole variety of
things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, well shit, why don't you
introduce yourself, bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm, my name is Adrian Devitt Lee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I work with, uh, project CBD,
which is a group in California that does a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of education, um, around cannabis and
medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also work with Kana craft, which is a
producer and distributor in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm Martin Lee's son.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I got into this, uh,
the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and he says, hello to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so, uh, lately I've been doing a lot
of stuff with pesticides and cannabis and
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I'm also geek out about,
uh, filling cartridges with oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been working on some, uh,
some formulations at Kana craft,
[SPEAKER_09]: which are very fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been doing that a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you and Tony will have to link up
after this because he's all about
[SPEAKER_02]: formulas.
[SPEAKER_02]: All about formulas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we were also talking about
pesticides earlier today and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, testing the cost of testing for
pesticides and just, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the overall bummer of not only the
product being so already expensive for
[SPEAKER_02]: these oils, but it being increased by the,
uh, by the cost of, of having to do high
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity, conscious business,
which is to make sure that the product
[SPEAKER_02]: you're selling isn't a toxic poison.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is a setting that that's something
you even have to say aloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we come from a unique
place in this industry, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition and in prohibition,
we know that all sorts of sorts of things
[SPEAKER_02]: end up existing that aren't really ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of one of the main reasons
we've been fighting against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That a getting put into prison,
getting arrested, having our lives ruined.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one really terrible side of it,
but also selling toxic poison to patients
[SPEAKER_02]: is a really big side of it as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize until recently actually
how useful sometimes federal guidelines
[SPEAKER_09]: are in terms of like pesticides,
you know, like because every state's done
[SPEAKER_09]: it differently.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every state kind of has to redo it,
um, and do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they try to work with each other
based on each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but there isn't, you know,
the, there's really limited information on
[SPEAKER_09]: what happens when you smoke pesticides,
you know, um, a lot of, a few pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Michael butanol, um, when you burn
them, they break down to cyanide.
[SPEAKER_09]: And ironically, cyanide is probably the
least of your concern in those cases
[SPEAKER_09]: because actually the pesticides are
generally much worse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't know if you guys know the
workshop and Jeff Raber, but, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: he was, uh, I had a conversation with him
because he, uh, he was actually explaining
[SPEAKER_09]: that cyanide isn't nearly as big of an
issue because when you look at toxicity,
[SPEAKER_09]: you generally measure things by their
weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cyanide is a really small molecule and
maybe a hundred times, it weighs a hundred
[SPEAKER_09]: times less than a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have like 10 parts per million
cyanide, that means you have a thousand
[SPEAKER_09]: parts per million of Michael butanol to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so actually if you have like a toxic
amount of cyanide from smoking pesticides,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's a much bigger issue is the pesticide
itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so there's like a lot of issues about,
you know, are some pesticides burned to
[SPEAKER_09]: much more toxic compounds, some to much
less toxic ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: In vaporizers, you'd probably expect that
you get a lot more of the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that's, I think probably the biggest
issue with vaporizers right now is that if
[SPEAKER_09]: you have dirty oil, the way pesticides or
the way heat breaks things down is a,
[SPEAKER_09]: is a radical mechanism, a free radical
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, cannabinoids are potent
antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in your oil, you're actually going to
be preventing the breakdown of those
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides much more if it's in a
concentrate than if it's off of a flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this is something I'm actually
trying to get an experiment set up,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, uh, to study this to be sure,
but, um, it would make sense that
[SPEAKER_09]: actually, uh, dirty oil could be much more
dangerous than dirty flower, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: for, for just for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, with smoking, there are other
issues, um, compared to vaporizing and all
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're concentrating it into a 10 times 10
fold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you know, 10 grams goes into one
gram of a, of a concentrated distillate,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're 10 times the, uh, concentration
value, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not clean, you're just going
to get dirtier and dirtier as you
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing is a bunch of pesticides,
uh, are actually somewhat similar to
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids chemically, not necessarily
like the, the exact structure,
[SPEAKER_09]: but, um, pyrethrins, which is a natural
pesticide comes from chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, they're have pretty much the same
boiling point, pretty much the same
[SPEAKER_09]: polarity.
[SPEAKER_09]: They co-alute together.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can actually have, when you
concentrate THC from 20% to 70%,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can, uh, end up concentrating
pyrethrins from like one part per million
[SPEAKER_09]: to even more than that to like 10 parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can sometimes be more concentrated
than, uh, you can con sometimes it
[SPEAKER_09]: concentrates better than the actual
cannabinoids or terpenes that you want to
[SPEAKER_09]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: More nightmares.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my buddy, I'll never forget my
Rasta friend, Mikey on the top of the
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain top and Remo might've even been
with us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to climb the craziest gnarly like
coral that probably was under the ocean a
[SPEAKER_02]: million years ago to get to the top of the
sky's mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn near killed ourselves getting up
there, sliced ourselves all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got like 50 gallon buckets up there
that he brought up on his head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says to me, just simply put,
he's looking for some sugar cane to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to hand crush for me so I can have a
little drink while I'm up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's, he's going to pick the sugar
cane and he's like, he's looking,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's looking, he's like, this is the one
I'm like, why'd you pick that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, you see this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, yeah, it's a wormhole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the worm likes this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means it's not poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dude, that's fucking crazy
because the one went out at home when the
[SPEAKER_02]: worms like it, they spray that shit with
poison to kill the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here he is using the worms as his
natural thermometer to find safety regions
[SPEAKER_02]: on his little Island that many people's
poor content spray pesticides on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, imagine living on an Island and
you're all like, I want to be organic and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's like DDT put more on your,
on your ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's crazy dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a funny story about that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do a lot of farmers markets and
sell all of our vegetables and stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these old Quaker families used to come
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all in their seventies and
eighties and all look through all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of our corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're unpeeling the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sort of like, what are you all
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, if the corn worm is
not in there, then I don't trust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't trust any corn that doesn't have
the corn worm and they're delicious to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she would just pop them right in her
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked her what they tasted like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, like sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it's pretty, well,
it's the truth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the simple, simple, simple,
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about the pyrethium
that's being tested positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: From cannabis, where is that from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it from the resin, from the seed,
from the leaves, the flowers, the stems,
[SPEAKER_05]: the roots?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where, where are you finding it from?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's assuming it's not just extracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually we've tested in flower usually.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you test it on leaves or like
stems or something, sometimes you see a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit that's, um, pyrethrins break
down pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sunlight, uh, the half life's like
eight hours or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the trichomes, when it's,
when it's kind of collected alongside
[SPEAKER_09]: these cannabinoids, which again,
it, it fits really well.
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of intercalates.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it produced inside of a glandular head?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: In chrysanthemum, it's mostly produced in,
uh, the trichomes, uh, in chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost exclusively produced in the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it, uh, the mother plant actually
pushes it, uh, into the seeds to protect
[SPEAKER_09]: the seeds from insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it would either have to have the
ability to or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've, uh, we actually,
there's Kevin McKernan and I, and a couple
[SPEAKER_09]: of people at Sonoma labs in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we just recently submitted a paper
about this, about the potential for
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis to produce pyrethrins because
we've been trying to explain why so many
[SPEAKER_09]: people are testing positive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's the, the pre-printed online.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I won't talk about it too much because
it hasn't been reviewed yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but, uh, the pre-print you can see it,
if you Google, uh, endogenous synthesis of
[SPEAKER_09]: pyrethrins by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we looked at the genetics and there
are a bunch of genetic, uh, markers or the
[SPEAKER_09]: enzymes that produce a pyrethrins in
chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are many homologs to that in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and we find it very often in cannabis
flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we test cannabis flowers,
um, it also comes up in the concentrate,
[SPEAKER_09]: but that's much less surprising.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would expect that, um, if it is in
fact being synthesized in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: it would be in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how, how is it produced?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it produced by synthesis, for example?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a common pathway.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of plants have these terp,
you know, they make terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pyrethrins are a terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, uh, the, there are kind of two
main steps.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them is from a fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and this is fairly common in many
plant species.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, uh, making, uh, jasmulone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and is it a mono-terpene or a
sesquiterpene?
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, uh, it's, uh, uh, two
mono-terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's a ester bond that's formed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and so it's like one mono-terpenoid is
called chrysanthemum, uh, chrysanthemol or
[SPEAKER_09]: chrysanthemic acid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it was discovered in chrysanthemum
first and the other is, uh, jasmulone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the two mono-terpenes that
are formed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and then just an ester linkage is made
by, uh, an enzyme that's also very common
[SPEAKER_09]: to many plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, um, that's how it's done in
chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and there are, there, we have some
evidence that that could be happening in
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Kevin's the man to look.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he's, he's, uh, he was one of the big,
uh, main people pushing that project.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, if, you know, depending on this
first, uh, the response, kind of this
[SPEAKER_09]: first paper, we're going to look at
actually trying to express or model these
[SPEAKER_09]: genes from cannabis in another,
like in a bacteria species to see if,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, if the genes that are present in
cannabis, the enzymes that are present in
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis can make it outside of cannabis,
or if it's something just weird that's
[SPEAKER_09]: going on with like, you know, there are a
lot of nutrients that have pyrethrins or
[SPEAKER_09]: other pesticides in them and aren't
labeled.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and so part of the issue is certainly
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that people are unknowingly adding
pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it is just bad practice where
people are using pyrethrins and other
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides and say they don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I think it is very possible that
cannabis is making it, but I'm,
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely want to see some more
research to that effect before saying
[SPEAKER_09]: anything definitively.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised that, uh, Dr. Osole and
other people who have, who look for
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Dr. Mishulam's, uh, folks haven't found
it before, but, uh, maybe I'm mistaken and
[SPEAKER_05]: they have, I didn't look into the
literature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there, it hasn't been found before.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, two comments on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: One is, you know, the recent, uh,
marijuana that got sent to Sue Sisley for
[SPEAKER_09]: a study on PTSD, that had a bunch of like,
you know, contaminants in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I, I have a lot of respect for
Osole, but that doesn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: they haven't looked for everything and,
uh, but, um, and also Dr. Osole to,
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I don't want to defend crappy weed,
but that's what he contracted by the NIDA
[SPEAKER_05]: to produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: He, he, he can't produce higher quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has the ability to, but that's not what
the contract is for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does the contract actually say crappy
weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: It says crappy Mexican schwa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: But wouldn't that be, it wouldn't be
Mexican schwa.
[SPEAKER_05]: To get rid of all the fines.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, the resin dust that fell
off, they want to remove that so it
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't clog up their Bonsack.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but what, I mean, do they,
are they growing like just Mexican land
[SPEAKER_03]: races, you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just 150 day, 150 day flowering?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: 150 day flowering, you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just growing the hardest strain
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pulling it at day 62 so we can get
the least out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's 150 day flowering,
but why, why grow it all the way?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a paper that just came out
looking at how NIDA's marijuana compares
[SPEAKER_09]: to markets.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and the main thing they found was
there was like 10 to 20 times more CBD,
[SPEAKER_09]: which for those of you who don't know it,
CBN is what THC and CBD convert to when
[SPEAKER_09]: it's left in the sunlight for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they also say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you just store it for three,
four years, it will start to convert to
[SPEAKER_05]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you get a full conversion on that
method with, with CBD to CBN?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know you could do that with CBN,
CBD to CBN.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could happen if.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it would be CBDV.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would probably be CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: To CBN, uh, CBD can convert to THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't, uh, really happen in
physiological.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it wouldn't happen on the plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's left in like high heat or
sunlight for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, it could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely all good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natasha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just wanted to ask, do any other
plants, um, besides Chrysanthemum make,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the Perthians?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard it said many ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pyrethrins is how I usually say it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one thing about Pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are six different compounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it's a family of compounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there are a couple other species that,
uh, can make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, Artemisia, I think is one of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I, it's mentioned, we looked at,
uh, three other, we looked at
[SPEAKER_09]: Chrysanthemum was the main one we were
looking at, but there are two other
[SPEAKER_09]: species that, um, it's been reported in
one or two papers that it, it may happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and you know, when you look at
terpenes, sorry, what was that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Finish and then I'll ask.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you look at terpenes, you know,
it's one of the most conserved pathways in
[SPEAKER_09]: plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what plants make to, uh, defend
themselves to attract, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, pollinators and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a very modular sort of pathway
where, um, you know, one, you can choose
[SPEAKER_09]: between 200 enzymes that will make
different sorts of, uh, that will kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: take one piece and make the next.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, um, if you have the enzymes for,
you know, some plants have some of the
[SPEAKER_09]: enzymes that make like Chrysanthemum acid,
but not the ones that will combine it with
[SPEAKER_09]: Jasmine to make pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's, it's sort of like a mix and
match of making different, uh,
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why is Chrysanthemum making this
product?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a defense mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that naturally what it's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then the induced, um, like if the
plant was under attack, could it be
[SPEAKER_01]: induced to be expressed?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that when, uh, when it's, uh,
there are two different ways that it can
[SPEAKER_09]: be induced or it's known to be,
or I guess three, one of them is what I
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned before, when a mother plant
makes seeds, it actually coats some of the
[SPEAKER_09]: seed and pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, when they start getting eaten by
plants, there's a, or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_09]: by, uh, insects, there's a, they,
it gets induced.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, um, when Chrysanthemum releases
certain volatile organic compounds,
[SPEAKER_09]: certain other terpenes that signals to its
neighbors, usually it's under attack,
[SPEAKER_09]: produce more pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, when some, one plant's under
attack, it not only makes pyrethrins,
[SPEAKER_09]: but makes other terpenes that signal to
the plants nearby, Hey, there,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, there's this insect in the area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, you got to defend yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you said your next steps with this
research were to confirm these pathways,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in like cell culture experiments or
what, what's your next steps to show if
[SPEAKER_01]: this is actually happening or,
you know, moving beyond just, this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothesis that could be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you prove this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I think it partly, it just depends
on what we have access to and kind of the
[SPEAKER_09]: people we know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I, I'm friends with Kevin
McKernan at medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that was a very easy way to start.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I, what I would like to see is a,
just a larger grows with like many plants
[SPEAKER_09]: and, and, you know, actually trying to
wound the plants to see for harvesting,
[SPEAKER_09]: to see, does that actually induce it,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so a, just replicating it is,
is a very common way to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_09]: something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also taking the actual genetics that
we found and expressing that either,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, doing a computational model of those
enzymes or expressing them in a bacteria
[SPEAKER_09]: and showing that when you give a bacteria,
the right genes from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: it can make pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that would be very, very strong
proof.
[SPEAKER_09]: But honestly, first, I just like to see,
um, better, like more replicas of this,
[SPEAKER_09]: that, you know, people growing it in very
controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_09]: You test the water, you test the soil,
you test, uh, everything and show that it
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't come from any source.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't come from your fertilizer or,
or the ground or the water.
[SPEAKER_09]: It came from the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say that peripium in, uh,
chrysanthemum says four or six different
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene compounds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, six.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you said in cannabis, they found two
of those six.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so in cannabis, we were looking for
only one of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and if, if, uh, the, the paper,
which is up on the bioarchive,
[SPEAKER_09]: again, it hasn't been reviewed yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, uh, or it's in the process.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, one of the issues we actually had was
that pyrethrins it, uh, the pyrethrin one
[SPEAKER_09]: is one of the compounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and that's normally what you test for.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really what's tested for,
for limits in like California and Oregon,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, because it's the most common.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not actually the most potent in terms
of its insecticidal properties,
[SPEAKER_09]: but, um, we only tested for one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was some, uh, the, the mass spec
was a little bit surprising, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: the, that we had from it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, there was, it seemed like there was
another compound there that we weren't
[SPEAKER_09]: really sure what it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it might've been, uh, an isomer of
pyrethrins, or it might've been actually a
[SPEAKER_09]: different compound that's similar.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as I said, these terpenes are
sort of, when you're combining them,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's a mix and match for what enzymes the
plant has.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it might be making something that's
very similar to pyrethrins, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're pretty sure it's making at least
pyrethrin one from this paper,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, from this data.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but it might be making other similar
compounds that just really look like
[SPEAKER_09]: pyrethrins, uh, pyrethrin one.
Um,
[SPEAKER_05]: the reason I'm asking is because if it has
all six compounds, it's obviously going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a pretty effective, uh, supply of
pyrethium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas if it's got one of them,
uh, maybe it's less effective and less
[SPEAKER_05]: damaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I, I've never heard of this,
so I'm really quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I, my internet might be a little bit
bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't hear that very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just said I'm very surprised that it's
found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as I said, you know, it's,
it's preliminary evidence and I,
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see more, uh, data before
we, we start saying that cannabis produces
[SPEAKER_09]: pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have some evidence that it,
that it can, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and another thing is that it definitely
doesn't happen in every plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, a lot of the plants that we test for
in Sonoma County, um, test positive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but also a lot of growers use
pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we have found plants that,
uh, consistently test negative.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, they've been CBD plants for the most
part, and I'm not sure if that's
[SPEAKER_09]: coincidence or, uh, you know, the genetics
might be linked.
Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also do an experiment where
you're looking at, um, like, I guess what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of pathogen would this be
specific for that they're using the sprays
[SPEAKER_01]: for mites?
[SPEAKER_09]: Insects and mites.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess you could even do like plants
in a controlled environment that are mite
[SPEAKER_01]: infested versus plants that aren't in the
sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if this is happening, is it
inducible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, is it, uh, because like you're
saying, some plants are showing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants aren't potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I was also wondering if you could
speak a little bit about if this is true,
[SPEAKER_01]: how is this going to affect, uh,
pesticide testing and what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, pesticide testing,
there's a whole other issue with that in
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, project CBD did a really, uh,
like a 20 something page report on the
[SPEAKER_09]: initial proposed regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, then those regulations were,
uh, essentially, uh, repealed under,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, a different law and new regulations
are going to be passed under an emergency
[SPEAKER_09]: ordinance in September or October,
and there won't be a public comment period
[SPEAKER_09]: because it'll be an emergency,
uh, uh, law.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's a very weird setup in
California right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of other issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say, you know, the initial
pesticide regulations, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're looking at the toxicity of
pesticides, you have to figure out how
[SPEAKER_09]: much you're actually using.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they had an estimate on like edible
consumption and their estimate was 10% of
[SPEAKER_09]: your body weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, you know, assuming that I'm
eating 12 pounds of marijuana edibles a
[SPEAKER_09]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was part of where the limits came
from.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's part of why they're so,
so low in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't really want to be pushing
higher pest limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think farmers should be using
organic practices, not doing monoculture
[SPEAKER_09]: that helps with pests.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of other things that can
help avoid, uh, just make the farming
[SPEAKER_09]: practices easier without pesticides be
much better, but flow and just kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: arbitrarily.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, again, 10% of your body weight
eating that much in edibles every day is
[SPEAKER_09]: a, is quite an overestimate, but then the
regulations on smoke products were based
[SPEAKER_09]: on tobacco and tobacco has lobbied really
hard against any regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are actually in many ways too
lenient.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, uh, I mean there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a lot of issues independent
of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as cannabis making pyrethrins,
if that does pan out, uh, one of the big
[SPEAKER_09]: questions is for how long has it been
doing this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it could be that in the selection
away from CBD strains, maybe it's linked
[SPEAKER_09]: to the THCA synthase enzyme in some way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it could be that it doesn't
necessarily guarantee the safety of
[SPEAKER_09]: pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if cannabis has been making pyrethrins
for a very long time, then all of the
[SPEAKER_09]: evidence about smoking cannabis being safe
and not causing lung cancer or oral
[SPEAKER_09]: cancers, then that would apply to
pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't apply to concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember how I said before,
how the breakdown of pesticides when you
[SPEAKER_09]: vape off concentrates is actually probably
much less than when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so it wouldn't necessarily speak to
the safety of pyrethrins and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but it would probably indicate that,
uh, smoking pyrethrins, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: low doses of pyrethrins, not like three
friends, but you know, parts per million
[SPEAKER_09]: concentration are probably, it would
suggest that they're safe, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: relatively safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, again, I don't want to be claiming
that like it's, oh, pesticides are fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lot of these pesticides are
fairly toxic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but pyrethrins, if you look chemically
at, at its structure, it will break down
[SPEAKER_09]: into those two mono terpenes, neither of
which are particularly toxic, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: when you burn it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, I think again, smoking pyrethrins,
uh, is probably safer than vaporizing
[SPEAKER_09]: them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but really we just need safety
studies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and because again, because of the
tobacco industry, largely it's lobbying,
[SPEAKER_09]: there's been very little information on
what happens when you burn pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, so we need more education.
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more of that, you know,
and thankfully there's youth like you that
[SPEAKER_14]: are looking into and looking past these
things so that we can get a better
[SPEAKER_14]: understanding overall.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's Sam's done over the decades,
but at the same time, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: we have to push this further and,
you know, keep at the research.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I patented a new variety
called Perithium Free and, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's guaranteed to have zero Perithium in
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, you work quick, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: You work quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in the, in the, in the wings
waiting for this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, you must have that patent office on
overdrive.
[SPEAKER_14]: That must be on speed dial, yo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He patented the patent office actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do anything without paying him.
[SPEAKER_05]: True.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm feeling pretty iry.
[SPEAKER_14]: So were there specific genetics that you
were finding the pyrethrins in or was it
[SPEAKER_14]: just across the spectrum?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I didn't hear the beginning of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I didn't hear the beginning of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it was just, um, you want to know what
your question was?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember your question.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, was when you collected it,
was, was it from a specific cultivar or
[SPEAKER_02]: just a variety of cultivars that you found
these?
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, we were, uh, so we have been
testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, uh, I was working with Sonoma lab
works, which is a testing lab in,
[SPEAKER_09]: in, uh, in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've been testing all sorts of
plants, but, uh, this was the,
[SPEAKER_09]: the experiment that we did that were,
it's in the publication process.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was with hydroponically grown in a
closed system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was, uh, I believe it were,
they were rebel grown seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that, that company, uh, from,
I think the strain was Metahase,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I would have to check that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like someone's having a pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turned out that the reason Hayes gets you
so high is because it's got some fricking
[SPEAKER_05]: freaking peritoneum in it or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not pronouncing it right, but
everybody has, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, that would be, that can't
be Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we're going to learn a lot of
stuff in the upcoming years about these
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways and these relationships that are
yet under, you know, not quite understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Adrian, I wanted to thank you for your
work and what you all are doing is really
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been keeping up with, um,
your work and, and everything that you all
[SPEAKER_00]: are putting out the new papers that you
all are putting out has just been totally
[SPEAKER_00]: mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really thankful for you and your
group in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of great people in this
community that got me into science today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have many, many people in this world
to thank for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you for following that
curiosity and acting upon it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one thing to have the concept and the
idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's another to act upon it and do it day
after day.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to just take a moment to talk
a little bit about what you were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, Adrian, about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, mostly what I'm interested
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that a lot of things that we
ingest are actually a pesticide and that
[SPEAKER_00]: may actually be beneficial to our body,
um, and to our intestine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, uh, lemon say lemon rind,
you know, uh, you mentioned Artemisia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wormwood is something that is utilized and
chrysanthemum is also utilized,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, for, you know, 5,000 years and ancient
Chinese medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a lung infection,
uh, you know, chrysanthemum is utilized in
[SPEAKER_00]: those teas, you know, that you steep for
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then drink these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in small doses, if it's directly from
maybe mother nature or the plant itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: without it being synthesized or
concentrated in the way that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: science does, um, you know, it's
interesting to look at a possible
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation of what mother nature
makes naturally as far as print the end is
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also what we synthetically,
uh, have turned into it and, and what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is something to look at?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to say, you know,
there are a lot of, you know, great
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds that come from plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look at, uh, I mean,
most medicine has come from, we found that
[SPEAKER_09]: a plant does something.
[SPEAKER_09]: We found some of the receptors that it
activates to have that effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we tried to make something that
does just that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We made a drug that does just that,
or, you know, one of the first pesticides
[SPEAKER_09]: was nicotine that we found was nicotine
from tobacco.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we made neonicotinoids,
which are kind of a catastrophe,
[SPEAKER_09]: but nicotine as a pesticide is actually
really effective.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we learned a lot about how our minds
work and how insects function just from
[SPEAKER_09]: studying, you know, what, what these
plants make both as defense mechanisms
[SPEAKER_09]: and, and many turn out to be medicines for
humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say, I really love the
view off of your porch there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was blown away by Sarah coming in
earlier with the sort of prairie
[SPEAKER_02]: wildflowers, the tree in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you came in with this beautiful
view.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me want to like get out of my
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're waiting for you anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a lot of smoke in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually, as you know,
you know, we're dealing with a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of fires right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we don't have quite the view that
we normally do, but, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're keeping it to a low and the winds
are coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the Harrop fire is the closest
to you or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's quite a few that are,
that are pretty all around pretty active
[SPEAKER_00]: all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some thunder and lightning that
came through here and it's pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that a fire is going to be caused from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been enjoying the sunshine
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hasn't had a really good, beautiful,
hot summer in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our gardens are really appreciating
this hot summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really thankful for it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kootenays, for those of you that have
never been, it's definitely a special
[SPEAKER_02]: place to drive through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky enough to go there in the
nineties and I got turned onto the Holy
[SPEAKER_02]: smokes boys, Alan middle miss and Dustin
sunflower and Paul de Feliz and my friend
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry and some other old schoolers like
man go into the co-op and Nelson and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, growing the a one magenta and
helping mix soil with the boys in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was, uh, that, that was,
that was made me who I am today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some of my first outdoor
gardening exposure, you know, to go on
[SPEAKER_02]: these hillsides of the Kootenays and
digging holes and mixing huge piles of
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt with these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would always like end up in
trouble and defend themselves in court.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, when I was just like,
you guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that's where it all came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we weren't able to hike seven
hours out with any pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: with any fertilizers, with any,
you know, glacier rock dust, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all you could possibly backpack
out was your kid and a little bit of food,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so you did what you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where all of our practices
originate from, you know, what is it that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can find out in those patches that we
can ferment and turn into nutrients for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and for the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, living that dream from the
nineties hasn't really ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, um, you know, gotten better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm definitely coming now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to come now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are bumping now for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lake is really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to swim in all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something you don't hear every day
in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lake is really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least the top six inches,
if you stay on the top six inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've been, I've been in the summertime
where the lake gets warm and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is like such a blessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have to understand this is like a
glacial fed lake, fed lake that is so cold
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like very, very cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful to swim in for that short period
of the summer though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such an awesome lake.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a whole bunch of people talking
about mountain grown trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something just beautiful about mountain
grown trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about those variables at certain
elevations that allow the genetics to
[SPEAKER_02]: express its potential to a level that is
not often replicated in an indoor grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an affinity for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sun-grown resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love tropical sun-grown resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It often blows my mind because terpenes
are so volatile and we think, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you can smell them in the air,
that means they're evaporating out and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're losing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet here I go to a field in Jamaica and
it's 35, 36 degrees Celsius every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beating down on these plants and
you'd think, well, if these terpenes are
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile, like how can they continue to
produce terpenes consistently while the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun is blazing them off at the most
accelerated rate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about like turn my skin red in
15, 20 minutes, like hot, hot sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at the profile, so they do
lean towards the sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always looking into different pest
remedies here in a natural way and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of different tests and trials with
different plant washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've found has been tremendously
successful if you are growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses is to do heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just goes along with what you were
talking about, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can utilize the sun and the heat to
get rid of pests on a massive level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about 36, 37 degrees on a
constant, when you heat up your greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: to that sort of level, it's phenomenal how
much the plants love that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll walk in there and after you've
cranked up the heat to 38 or 40 in your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and the plants are just praying
and they're so excited about the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can rock some Bikram yoga out of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can rock some Bikram yoga in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you walk in, it's an instant
sauna.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to stay with your
plants and everything, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal remedy and also the plants
really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pests don't, but the plants really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, humans, we're always coming up with
new ways to get these little bugs off of
[SPEAKER_02]: our food and out of our smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we'll continue to come up with
the most unique ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really excited with Peter from Soil
Balance Pro coming in and giving us the
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria on the roots knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit has not left my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually brought a bunch of it down to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me 50 grams of it and I brought it
to Jamaica and we'll probably be testing
[SPEAKER_02]: out one of our fields or half a field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The master grower will be the decider of
that, but I passed them on to Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I passed them on the materials and I
definitely look forward to seeing the
[SPEAKER_02]: results of root symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just actually went onto their website
and five minutes ago, if you saw me do
[SPEAKER_13]: that, I just bought a 10 gram thing for a
check out for $53.85.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on its way.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for educating me on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, in the beginning, then talking
about what we're in Jamaica with there and
[SPEAKER_13]: of course, getting back.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had plants in the ground right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hundred plant license and I don't
have a single plant in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like maybe criminal,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be growing plants, but when
you're as busy as I am, the thing I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: do is plant a garden, take care of it,
get it to the point where it needs an
[SPEAKER_02]: enormous amount of work and then bugger
off to Jamaica for two weeks while my wife
[SPEAKER_02]: with a toddler and two teenagers has to
take care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not allowed to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of respect for my wife, I haven't
planted any plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's wrong, but it's out of respect
for my love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, dank Duchess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's sad, but it's out of respect
for my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes it less sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we have a bong rip here on Hash
Church?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel that you have to by any means.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's shall.
[SPEAKER_13]: I left my first bounce dry sift in this
container when I left the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I came back, it all turned to the
sound of parchment next to the parchment,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it all turned into this nice little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it looks like an elephant.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just pressed that out and showed you
what we're talking there and how there's
[SPEAKER_13]: definitely nothing ever sprayed on this
plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we know there is no pesticides or
anything that were put in this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So of course, nice and fresh resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: But definitely when it hits a little bit
of heat, it just turned right into a
little.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm not know that's what I'm
hitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, rip it up there, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rip it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be long once this guy who did
this shirt with all these Internet names.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be like it'll be your name on here,
Adrian and Natasha.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these all the researchers,
I want to share it with all the like
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors and researcher names on people
like, who's that on your shirt?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, bro, you don't know about CBD
synthase.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got to get shit out, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got the Shulam right here, dog.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some grinspoon over here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So rise over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I have a full respect for all of
the different aspects of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge, but I really I respect the
scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the knowledge of going in and
figuring out these mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_02]: these pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning what's happening and then
explaining it to to us, the layman,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I I'm intrigued by it for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you also advance us politically and
sociologically and on so many levels that
[SPEAKER_14]: push us.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we wouldn't be where we are
without science.
[SPEAKER_14]: We would still be there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you guys are just trying to get high.
[SPEAKER_14]: But fortunately, you know, science is
consistently proving otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go out on a limb and say,
it was science, not a Cheech and Chong
[SPEAKER_02]: movie that Sanjay Gupta realized he had
been shamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was lied to, I was lied to,
he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes that takes a big man to kind of
come out and say you you kind of didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure change things for a lot of
people, those people that would never have
[SPEAKER_02]: even considered such a thing without
someone like him, because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't matter if it's their sons and
their daughters and their brothers and
[SPEAKER_02]: sisters and spouses, whatever,
telling them this like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be until like Sanjay Gupta goes
on CNN and says, hey, this shit's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, did you know that this shit was
medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mom, I've been doing this for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting, too, because what
you just said is also really in lieu of
[SPEAKER_00]: and in light of, you know, all of the
different people that have been out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and already knowing that this is a
medicine for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not till Sanjay, you know,
says something in the same way that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not until the scientists that actually
study it says something that it actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gives real meaning to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, all of us without the
science have known for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if not beyond, you know,
thousands of years that this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible medicine and we haven't had
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that there's light shed on
what we're doing now that science is now
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in studying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what a beautiful fusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had that we had the birth of science,
which was the bioassay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bioassay is the birth of science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had we were trying it on ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually it turned into gas
chromatographs and HPLCs and proton HNMRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bottom line is we did we were able
to do art.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how how how much here's here's a
funny story.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time I made bubble out of mint
because I started playing around with a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of different plants or basante.
[SPEAKER_02]: And chamomile and mint and lavender and
rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made bubble hash out of these plants
back in late 90s, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I made the mint, for whatever reason,
I just was like it was it was like really
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the most hash like substance like
rose was pink and weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mint was hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could you could you could do this with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like right away I was like,
oh, I'm going to do a 50-50 rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a rip of the mint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a rip of the of the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll mix it in together and then I'll take
a night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was still burning back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was using beeline or probably a match
inspired by Sam at the time on a fresh new
[SPEAKER_02]: stainless steel screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ripped this and I blew it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember because I knew the bubble
hash really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it was coffee stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say it made you cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an expector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to say the least, I had to say and I
blew it out and it was so smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like Google like mint cough
suppressants and come up with this like
[SPEAKER_02]: Phillips Morris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twenty three million dollar project of
like figuring out what would suppress
[SPEAKER_02]: cough with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they came up with mint like
mentholated mentholated cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they spent twenty three million
dollars on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like the Russians to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: when they spent all the money on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pen that would write in space and the
Russians just brought the pencil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like the Russians because I
literally had figured this shit out in
[SPEAKER_02]: like twenty five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One gallon batch mint and bubble my bong,
a lighter or a match and a stainless steel
[SPEAKER_02]: screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here here this big company had to
spend twenty three million dollars to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure it out.
Bioassay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the, you know, cough drops like
Ricola cough drops.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much just menthol.
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing in mint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty effective.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for those of you that have never
made mint hash, I do implore you to go
[SPEAKER_02]: find some beautiful mint.
[SPEAKER_02]: All sorts of varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mint is secretes its essential oils out of
glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few different types of them on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really are very similar to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a much lower yield, not quite as
low as rose, which is incredibly low
[SPEAKER_02]: yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a very small amount of these
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you go looking for plants that secrete
essential oils out of trichomes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you realize cannabis is at the top of the
heap, top of the pile, like numero uno,
[SPEAKER_02]: the gold medalist each and every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, look at that, Peter, right next to a
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're next to a waterfall, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys, I had to give you this beautiful
journey for a second, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's probably some excellent
conversation going on and you guys are
[SPEAKER_11]: doing some beautiful, high level,
amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're so waterfall.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is that is so awesome,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus, you're so beautiful, you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just super cool that he came in
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just literally spoke about Peter just
so not so long ago, and now he's sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: an epic waterfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my God, that waterfall could be
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Agua Azul near the border of
Guatemala and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's not, but looks like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually Sabino Canyon, this
beautiful valley in the desert.
[SPEAKER_10]: So gorgeous mountains, saguaras
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a great morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to stop in, send my love.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my respect for all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's hard for me to hear, but just
wanted to send that love and appreciation
[SPEAKER_10]: and gratitude for your work and all of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: So much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very awesome of you to come in and
share a minute of a beautiful waterfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see those huge cacti at the end there
when he turned to the pan to the hill,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was those giant cactus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the vibe of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, getting back to plants that
have high resonance and high terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: counts, it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage people to also make teas
out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere that you look and you
can make teas so easily and you can spray
[SPEAKER_00]: them on your gardens as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drench them into your soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different uses and it's
fun to find out, you know, do one plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender and maybe another plant in I
don't know, Oregon grape or, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or fur leaves or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really test to see what plants
like different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been pretty interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were always, you know, looking at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant symbiosis for certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know Paul Stamets has been doing
some absolutely incredible work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi, with the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everything that guy does is like
standing ovation level of quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to go see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to speak not too long ago in
Richmond, BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was definitely, it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you say, Natasha?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a really inspiring talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to ask you more about what
you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I've asked you a few times,
but when you were making stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender, how does that compare
peppermint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to know, lavender with when
you're concentrating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also thought that was really
interesting what you were saying with the
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender pouring it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you using it for insecticides or what
purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on overall wash, you know,
to, to keep your plants clean is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea in the same way that you want to
keep your cyanobacteria on your leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, totally healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great to look at a, just a really
easy microscope, you know, do a wash of
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the beneficial bacteria will
continue to stay on that leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: but get rid of a lot of the dust and maybe
some of the pathogenic fungi and yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lavender is pretty fantastic for just
washing and keeping it a preventative leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: coating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to say about lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I had my vapor bar back in 2003 in
Vancouver, I had this bar called the
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalation station of vaporization and we
had a whole host of varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: A variety of vaporizers, the Aromed from
the German company that was really in a
[SPEAKER_02]: consortium of patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe even cancer patients,
they were the ones that designed this
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was used with a light bulb and it had a
glass bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the volcano, of course,
from stores in Bickel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the volatizer from David Wheeler at
the time who had the quartz bowl with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these really unique vaporizers back
then that were in existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started vaporizing herbs with
people that came in from the streets,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, customers that walked in off the
street and we'd have a whole variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: different herbs to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lavender was really the one that
people enjoyed the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't even really realize how
medicinal it was, but it was unbelievable,
[SPEAKER_02]: the power of vaporizing lavender,
especially for people who had asthma or
[SPEAKER_02]: bronchitis or any type of lung ailment,
it seemed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you look at how lavender treats
skin when skin is burned, lavendula oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even lavendula oil was like the
birth of aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the story goes, a French chemist
burns his hand on the Bunsen burner,
[SPEAKER_02]: sticks it in the lavendula oil and doesn't
even get a blister.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very effective, maybe more
effective than aloe vera on burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine the vapor being inhaled into
the lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very nice and smooth and mentholated
as well when you exhaled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had a friend with a serious,
serious case of chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: bronchitis that he had had almost 10
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started vaporizing lavender out of
the volcano bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was about two weeks in that he was
just like, I don't have bronchitis
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't not had bronchitis for 10
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always used it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lavender, if I'm getting like sickness or
like a lung ailment, I'll vaporize
[SPEAKER_02]: lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely stand by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also do mullen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mullen is another wonderful expect
expectorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take little bong hits of that
dried along with your weed or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporize it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild cherry leaf is a fantastic
expectorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that has a tremendous
amount of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you can find a wild cherry
tree, they grow around all up and down the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bark is utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of terpenes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hit the early spring leaves,
that also can be burned and utilized as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we really could go on and on with
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender is a fantastic ally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone froze up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see many motions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, there's some motion all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was like and then they all
started moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well played, gentlemen and ladies,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've just listened to some amazing
knowledge that's coming through on the
[SPEAKER_13]: pesticide and the information that was
dropped this morning is kind of making me
[SPEAKER_13]: think and I want to go and work on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do some pruning and have them outside.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've been kind of living in the air and
enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to have plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I wish I had some myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice to be in that acre in Jamaica
and walk around all those big,
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful, lush cannabis plants and just
smell all the different terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: coming off of each different row,
which was each row was a different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, there was some I love Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about that Jack Frost
that just has the most beautiful terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do kind of look forward to the days
where the names aren't really as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpene profiles, you know,
where we really understand that what Jack
[SPEAKER_02]: Frost really is, is it's a terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be ones that are the
majority and ones that are the minority.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may even be many of them,
like Sam said earlier, that the labs
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't testing for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know everyone that's present,
because I don't think just because it has
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot or a little, it doesn't have the
ability to affect the profile a great
[SPEAKER_02]: deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at an herb like, what's that
herb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cilantro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So strong, the tiniest little bit on a big
meal, especially for someone that's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I don't like cilantro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put a tiny little bit of cilantro in
someone's meal that doesn't like cilantro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is unreal how strong that can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you, it's not the most
prevalent terpene in the batch.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm one of those people.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, yeah, it's, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet you can definitely tell and taste
the slightest hair.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it has like a good amount,
like a pinch, then it's like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm in California, so it's impossible
to find a salsa or a burrito or anything
[SPEAKER_14]: without, here, here's an even sprinkle on
top.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, I have my own hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to what taste bud 420 just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can bullshit a name, but you can't
bullshit a terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like hard to bullshit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will say a name and I'll smell it
and be like, oh yeah, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to be said in the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Dr. Natasha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cilantro makes a great foliar too,
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you let it grow, go into the flower
a little bit and it flowers up before it
[SPEAKER_00]: turns into the coriander seed,
I mean, the plants freaking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make a easy tea out of that or
you can fresh press it into juice,
[SPEAKER_00]: add a couple of tablespoons into a gallon
of water and foliar spray and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: just freak out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say coriander seed
essential oil is also pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear me okay now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So coriander seed is really interesting,
especially for people who don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: cilantro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the people who hated cilantro
for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was weird in my 20s,
something shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden I like crave
cilantro all the time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like throw like handfuls,
like I eat it more than I eat any other
[SPEAKER_01]: green, just like I buy a thing of cilantro
and I'll eat that within two days,
[SPEAKER_01]: like on top of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best chelating herbs out
there for getting rid of heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: cilantro is, but go ahead about coriander.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the coriander seed essential oil,
when I started working with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just blew me away the aroma of it
because it's actually 60% linalool,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is similar to what's in lavender,
which is even higher than lavender,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has just this like lovely aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even working with it in my perfumes
is just, a fun essential oil that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: completely overlooking for the longest
time because I just was assuming it
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled like the greens, but it smells
completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arivada uses that for a lot of different
ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it both internally and also as
flushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it externally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it to elevate the mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a black coriander that's
especially useful for medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow that type of cilantro as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just even has a higher terpene
residual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I just, I find it so fun working
with, just working with these plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similar to cannabis, you think like,
like if you're just talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant, it's like, well,
what part of the plant and how are you
[SPEAKER_01]: using it and how is it processed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to remember that every single
plant is just as complex as cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: and can be used in all these different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're using the flower for might
be a complete completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: application for the root of the plant or
processed in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I haven't worked a lot with teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done obviously teas drinking and even
I've done a little bit of herbal teas for
[SPEAKER_01]: like hair rinses and experimented with not
even just for coloring, but like I've used
[SPEAKER_01]: hibiscus teas for hair and it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes your hair feel just like really
nice and silky and like thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even hibiscus is this beautiful red
color and it has, it's one of the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidant teas that's, and also good for
your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you work with hibiscus or any of like-
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people and Ayurveda has been
using it for a really long time to
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen the venous, you know,
tissue and our fine capillary tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always feel like whenever I'm making
a wash out of hibiscus, I can really
[SPEAKER_00]: notice that the leaf structure gets a
little bit thicker because we'll always do
[SPEAKER_00]: something maybe three times in a row to
really understand it because plants
[SPEAKER_00]: respond so quickly to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've noticed with hibiscus that it's
almost thickened the outer layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, of the leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really amazing for a lot of
different values.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have to say about that,
Sarah, with your hair blowing in the wind?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on mute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like I'm loving all the knowledge and
the fact that I'm on a farm here and I
[SPEAKER_07]: have all the sorts of these plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got like giant hibiscus plants that I
bring in and out every year and I've got
[SPEAKER_07]: big patch of mint and raspberry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got all sorts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, I love the idea of playing
around with all this stuff and having some
[SPEAKER_07]: fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for having me today
on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly don't have the same level or
type of knowledge as you, but I really
[SPEAKER_07]: appreciate being able to come on and plug
the cups and the event and all the people
[SPEAKER_07]: involved in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: My battery's basically dead now too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is my sayonara.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right on, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we'll talk to you soon and see
you soon after that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will see you soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, Mark and everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Sarah Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah always had nice buds and nice
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's always kind of had a good ear to the
ground when it comes to quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There she goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is Sarah?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's out in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She lives out in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly where, but somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I met her once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was at Lyft when we were all,
we all went out for dinner at one point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we were a big group of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just had like a nice little chat,
but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope to hang out with her more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I remember that dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we decided to sit on those strange
square cushions instead of an actual table
[SPEAKER_02]: and chairs just because we all wanted to
eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound familiar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hotel room, something, hotel, restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all melts into one after you do about
500 of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: These events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, please don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Muting me, Sarah, Natasha, mute me
anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget texting people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little delighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started hearing echoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my voice still okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's still off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can hear me okay though.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause can everyone mute everybody or is
that, do I still have like no hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be, well, oh no,
you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody can mute everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll all just be like, down to sign
language.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody ever told me that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean I've got the power.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I thought you patented that like
months ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't you patent that Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, come on now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow it slipped through my fingers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I accidentally muted Chimera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little eager last episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was mute mute, keeping the sound nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chimera was mid-sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just muted up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always harder to unmute them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, I can't unmute this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I ban him or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even worse is when you don't realize
the cursor is on the Google chat and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you go to type something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you hit like all the right things to
actually open up and then eject someone
[SPEAKER_02]: from the room with just the keyboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's happened a few times to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had some of my drone footage from
Jamaica uploaded so I could share with you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys some of that footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was, it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nobody was shotgun shooting down
drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was shotgun shooting down drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're on a 20 acre property that
we're, uh, that we are in control of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I don't fly the drone off of that
20 acres, but, uh, I'm sure you could fly
[SPEAKER_02]: your drone somewhere in Jamaica where it
would get shot down, but I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: suggest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are expensive drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you put it up, you're just
nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, is this going to be the time
that this $2,000 camera that's basically
[SPEAKER_02]: attached to a drone is going to fall on
the ground and smash into a million
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a horrible feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that you never have to feel it,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though you've probably patented that
feeling already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you have to feel a feeling
before you patent it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, so Adrian, tell us more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you heading to any conferences?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's you're just traveling somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was just on vacation recently.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I am going, there's a conference at
Northeastern that Alex Macriani she's
[SPEAKER_09]: putting on.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the guy who crystallized the CB one
receptor and he's been involved in,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, making a lot of different compounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you ever see a compound that's AM,
uh, four oh four AM two five one,
[SPEAKER_09]: the AM compounds are Alex Macriani.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interestingly, AM four oh four.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was discovered that Tylenol breaks down
into AM four oh four and it's a nanomide
[SPEAKER_09]: reuptake inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Tylenol actually some of the
anti-anxiety and potentially painkilling
[SPEAKER_09]: effects from of Tylenol come from it,
uh, increasing the activity of
[SPEAKER_09]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that's not where its toxicity comes
from.
[SPEAKER_09]: That comes from something else in the
liver.
[SPEAKER_09]: But so he's, he's been involved in a lot
of drug design and, uh, kind of designing
[SPEAKER_09]: drugs based on understanding how
cannabinoids work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and so, uh, that's what he's,
the conference is about something on,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, drug design and drugs of abuse,
but, uh, the, it should be interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in, uh, Boston in like two weeks or
so.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like an interesting
conference.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting people, hopefully.
Presumably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to the, uh, European
cannabinoid research conference?
[SPEAKER_09]: The ICM?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that one's in September out in Cologne
and there's, there's, uh, I actually just
[SPEAKER_09]: saw the, uh, speaker lineup just came out
for that one and there, there's a bit on
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides and like, uh, and health.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a bit about medicine and kind of
what each, uh, countries experiencing in
[SPEAKER_09]: terms of regulations and, uh, just
legalization overall.
[SPEAKER_09]: So France has someone speaking,
I believe Germany has someone speaking,
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada has someone speaking, uh,
there's at least one person from the U S
[SPEAKER_09]: speaking about some of the struggles in
the U S I'm not sure if they're actually
[SPEAKER_09]: are specific to different States.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I'm hoping to go to that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that, uh, as we'll have a lot of
great scientists there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jehan Marku are both talking about
quality of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: So two good people to be speaking on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if Ethan Russo was on like the
grateful dead lot and came up to you and
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, I'm going to tell you about the
quality of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would for sure know more than anyone
else on the lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that awesome?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ethan's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he also, he's one of those people
who's really, you know, not about genetic
[SPEAKER_09]: engineering and pesticides, but really
organic practices and just growing well
[SPEAKER_09]: and breeding well to make, make good
strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, he's, he's been a big force
behind keeping the whole side of,
[SPEAKER_09]: of the science on marijuana to,
you know, good agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, uh, a lot of people owe him
some thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we lost dragonfly medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll be back another week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I think because it's the first
time I've been back for a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm anxious to go hang out with my
family and go spend the Sunday afternoon
[SPEAKER_02]: doing Sunday afternoon things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have anything else you want to
cover on today's hash church or shall we
[SPEAKER_02]: cover it another weekend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to have you back, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some great knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested in what you're doing and
very thankful Dr. Natasha invited you in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be happy to come back sometime.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be really interested to see if any
of these compounds are actually produced
[SPEAKER_05]: in the resin or just in the rest of the
plant because it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll certainly keep y'all in the loop
as, as we figure more out because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: very interesting and there's a lot to know
and it's all exciting to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mr. Skunkman Sam for coming in and
sharing your knowledge as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Dr. Natasha for helping me co-host
today and being a part of church and as
[SPEAKER_02]: always Etienne being the number one guy in
the room every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Adrian, thanks so much for coming in
and sharing what you've been sharing with
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to D420K and Johnny B, Tony V and
Peter Saab from Soil Balance Pro who came
[SPEAKER_02]: in and shared a beautiful waterfall with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Sarah Sunday for coming in and
letting us know what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone I've forgotten, terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel terrible, but we got to end it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see you guys next week on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everybody.
