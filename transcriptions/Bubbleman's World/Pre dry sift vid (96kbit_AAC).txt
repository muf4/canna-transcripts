[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been filming my YouTube videos with
my good camera lately, but it's taken a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time to upload them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you guys some mini
episodes of what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a little makeshift hash making
room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice little pile of bud right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bunch more right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing we must have, I don't know,
four pounds or something, three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds, mostly popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing is we're basically
gently, we've got them out on the 200
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the 100 lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 110 lines per inch, which is 140 micron
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a silk screen that's extremely
tightly glued to the frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we just gently bring the
buds back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever so gently, not squeezing them,
not being too violent with your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is going to do is it's going
to give us a single screen extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: which by lifting the screen up,
you can see there's a light sift there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the corner, I've got a pile of
gold over there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice, slow work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to beat the shit out of
this material like the Moroccans do with
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks to the point where it's giving us,
you know, 95% contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to gently extract just
the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, we're going to do the
secondary process and we're going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside because that process is,
this is good to do outside as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the heads more brittle,
but the secondary process of carding the
[SPEAKER_00]: material over the screen and pushing that
contaminant through the tighter hole while
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving the gland heads on top of the
mesh, it's, yeah, it's a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: easier process, much easier when done in
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capitate stocks and the systole of
hairs just seem to break much more readily
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's very cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we'll be making more hash here
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Okay.
Thanks for watching.
