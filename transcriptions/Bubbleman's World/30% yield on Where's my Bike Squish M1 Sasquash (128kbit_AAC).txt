[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome back to bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here With the where is my bike like I
promised part two of the last video from
[SPEAKER_01]: maple butter reviews I've been waiting
actually it was waiting for a sunny day so
[SPEAKER_01]: I could share that beautiful sunny sunny
light To produce this wonderful rosin that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're about to make here today But you
know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the rains have started here on
the west coast in the Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not about to stop anytime soon and I
figured no time like the presence to Open
[SPEAKER_01]: up these buds and check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so without further ado,
let's crack these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is my bikes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really excited about this imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had this for almost a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh My god, oh That smell reminds me so
much of Amsterdam That is an Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really like strong Amsterdam Lemony
goodness
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would guess that right there is about
a five grammer and I would guess this
[SPEAKER_01]: right here is a five grammer So it looks
like we got ten grams So ten grams should
[SPEAKER_01]: squish out about three grams of rosin if
we're lucky and we get that 30% I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: take some macro shots of this bud So I can
share the beautiful resin that's on here
[SPEAKER_01]: with you and then we're gonna get to
squishing Alright, so I took the bud apart
[SPEAKER_01]: and photographed on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here That this bud with the
teared screen weighs 5.1 grams This one
[SPEAKER_01]: came in a little bit less at like four
point Something four point eight four
[SPEAKER_01]: point nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was so four point nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between those two buds we have five Ten
grams or nine point nine close enough And
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna get ready to put them through
bubble man's world
[SPEAKER_01]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I have broken down the one
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say barely touching it man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got my fingers sticky I mean sticky
icky where You can pick up a scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that kind of sticky icky That's
sticky icky right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty heavy object Anyway,
of course many of these doing this on a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial level for patients would be
wearing gloves and it would be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner This is in my yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for my personal and I'm not gonna
wear gloves for my personal All I really
[SPEAKER_01]: did was I broke that bud up into smaller
remnant pieces And you can see there it's
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go in the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also Already kind of pre done Where
one of the tricks that Sasquatch talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about is getting the holes filled up on
the screen into the corners and so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the most important part as you're
As you're lightly filling this and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be hilarious because this bud is so
fucking sticky Talk about a challenge Wow
[SPEAKER_01]: nice nice nice challenge to have I gotta
say everyone else out there You need to
[SPEAKER_01]: step your shit up on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am seeing some absolutely Pathetic bud
these days that people are really thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: is the is the greatness and I hear people
calling out everyone Oh, they don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe don't throw stones if you live in a
glass house Hey All right All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not gonna film this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna take me a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come back when we are fully full All
right, so we got that nicely packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the bumps in the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just sticky icky Really looking
forward to getting this press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys bubble man here Just waiting for
my temperature to drop down to 220 might
[SPEAKER_01]: seem a little high for some of you guys,
but for this Particular cultivar with the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually pretty perfect My pad right
here We got we're getting close we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting close Yeah real excited about this
press
[SPEAKER_01]: All right pushing it in a fair bit you
don't want it sitting right on the edge I
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's nice to see the resin pouring
out but if you put your pad too far close
[SPEAKER_01]: to the edge you can end up getting It
pinched and you can get a blowout
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how much pressure you're
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get this going shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to remember that's bud in there
everyone that is bud that is not hash
[SPEAKER_01]: Color is absolutely perfect And I wish you
could smell this the resin is coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: both sides of the press and our drip is
Continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah So for the camera motion,
of course just trying to get you guys the
[SPEAKER_01]: best The best possible view for this
little press Remember we only put five
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of of material in of bud So we're
looking to get maybe a gram and a half a
[SPEAKER_01]: gram and a half will put us at the 30%
range
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say we even have a tiny little bit of
a press left there And there's what we got
[SPEAKER_01]: So we shall collect it
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so there's what we got Not sure
if it's gonna be that gram and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's check it out All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is 1.5 grams on the scale
Thought it was gonna come a little short.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie I feel like there's at
least a tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a point one can see it kind of in
the screen there So we're gonna try
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing this one more time and see what
we can't get Always good to do a second
[SPEAKER_01]: run with quality of this level All right,
so just like I thought a very very little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit left Not a ton Maybe that point one
that I was talking about but All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was a nice little squish as I kind
of figured it would be the last little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: that I squished is coming out between
point one and point two The original
[SPEAKER_01]: squish that I did came at like 1.4 1.5 So
I would say we're probably accurately
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting at 30% Some people might add it up
and say oh my god 34% 30 It's unlikely
[SPEAKER_01]: it's because of this scale only goes to
one point that and the way it was
[SPEAKER_01]: flickering Between 1.4 and 1.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say accurately combined out of
that five grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got about 1.5 and look at the quality
of said rosin, I Mean, let me tell you I
[SPEAKER_01]: had a I had one guy comment on my video
recently saying that I was being paid by
[SPEAKER_01]: maple butter to do these reviews You think
I got to be paid to do a review like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you fucking kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the stickiest bud that I've
handled in a Long long long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you I'm very very impressed
with these maple butter Guys, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing the flame and shout out to Karma
Genetics for this beautiful cross of
[SPEAKER_01]: Amnesia haze crossed with the biker Kush
the amnesia haze is the super silver haze
[SPEAKER_01]: or the haze crossed with haze Time skunk
number one crossed with haze times haze
[SPEAKER_01]: the super silver haze again crossed with
Northern Lights number five I believe and
[SPEAKER_01]: the biker Kush is the Hells Angels og
crossed with the Lucifer og and you put
[SPEAKER_01]: them both together You got to seriously go
find your bike Why don't we press press up
[SPEAKER_01]: another quick medallion while we're here
and we'll call it a day sound good guys
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys so for those of you that want to
know a little bit of an easier way to fill
[SPEAKER_01]: these screens And I'm sure most of you
have been on this ball, but basically a
[SPEAKER_01]: little business card sliding it in like
that and just pushing your Material down
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be hash or herb is Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull out the card, and you've got
a perfectly filled bag And then of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of massaging it a
little bit Softening it up and making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you fill up any of those holes
Because we don't want these little holes
[SPEAKER_01]: they try so desperately there we go just
push that material down and work it all
[SPEAKER_01]: into the base of the screen and While you
see you saw from my last press that
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously I was fairly efficient with it
I'd say I got about 90 plus percent out of
[SPEAKER_01]: my first press and that's why we press a
little bit warmer and for a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer that was about a Minute and 50
seconds that I pressed the last batch for
[SPEAKER_01]: and let me tell you I just had a dab off
camera on Point so without further ado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to the next press All right,
so we're back our parchment in Magnets
[SPEAKER_01]: attached it's always nice to see what's
going on catch the drip All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: so We'll shut her down a little bit and as
Matt mentioned from Sasquatch leave this
[SPEAKER_01]: up It'll make it easier for you to pick
the rosin Well not the rosin but the The
[SPEAKER_01]: packet up of herb it'll make it easier for
you To pick up because that little flap
[SPEAKER_01]: will be sitting there and it'll it'll
avoid you accidentally pushing the little
[SPEAKER_01]: screen packet into your freshly pressed
rosin so Try to avoid that Go down for a
[SPEAKER_01]: mild pre-press just like a ten second or
even
[SPEAKER_01]: Feels pretty proper
[SPEAKER_01]: So we came in again at 1.5 1.6 even I
think the tear is a little off But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is impressive That is impressive
Another solid 30% see how it moves 1.4 1.5
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.6 I'd say realistically, it's probably
1.4 and I probably still got the tiniest
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So We'll go back and check Yeah,
so it looks like 1.4 The tear is 0.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we probably still Alright so here we've
got the second Press on the second five
[SPEAKER_01]: grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was hovering around 1.4 1.5 So
I'm guessing there's going to be another
[SPEAKER_01]: point 1 or point 2 in here to top us off
to that lovely 30% yield
[SPEAKER_01]: All right a little bit there Definitely
worth dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and that second press came out
Well, it was at point 2 but now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: retail there is the tear so point 2 is the
proper point 2 I think it's an actual
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate and Yeah, that combined with the
1.3 to 1.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are at 1.5 again Alright guys,
welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a little bit of Sun finally came
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I whipped off two patties That one's just
starting to butter a little bit there
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty sweet pretty sweet butter in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh And this one too this one too is doing
the butter still very beautiful Quite
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward to hitting that All right
Buttery buttery goodness, so I figured we
[SPEAKER_01]: would do at least a rip of the where is my
bike now that you've seen the squish 30%
[SPEAKER_01]: yield how incredible is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you it blew my mind Even
though I'd seen it once before it still
[SPEAKER_01]: blew my mind Let's get ourselves a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, this is nice
[SPEAKER_01]: All right The mothership the egg
[SPEAKER_01]: Always exciting to hit that first rip of a
new flavor But one, you know, so well
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta give props to maple butter It's
incredible quality gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some of the stickiest herb I've
ever seen I have touched in a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sticky icky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the true sticky icky to put posters
up with that herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put posters up with that herb
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemony flavor mixed with the
terpenaline, it's just my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah My god Definitely down with
hitting many more of those Now that it
[SPEAKER_01]: buttered out actually I'll be able to take
some photos earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was It looks so stable and tacky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to take a picture of just rosin
in the medallion, especially with my lens
[SPEAKER_01]: Going in too close Just doesn't quite have
the same effect It's amazing how this DC
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner Picks up the resin out of the
banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to say it every time I see it it
impresses me I was going for a little
[SPEAKER_01]: while without without using it and Banger
started getting pretty chazzy This one
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit many many times so Not the best
shape, but still doing okay Well to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: some spots off there All right So,
where is my bike 30% yield Sasquatch m1
[SPEAKER_01]: Popped it out of the mothership with the
lemon drop mega pot there with the blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dial Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everyone for watching and Yeah,
may the full melt bless your bowl sooner
[SPEAKER_01]: than later Peace out everybody

with pleasure and pain We'll get to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are Sick and feel tired as the light
goes out the train We'll get to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are Sustaining, melting, living,
sipping clean food and clean water We'll
